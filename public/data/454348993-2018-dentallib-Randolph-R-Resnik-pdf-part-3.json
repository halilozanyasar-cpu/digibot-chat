Resnik\n11 \nPrimary soft tissue closure is a mandatory condition for the \nsuccess of implant and grafting procedures. It ensures healing by \nprimary intention and requires minimal soft tissue collagen for-\nmation and soft tissue remodeling, which minimizes postopera-\ntive discomfort. Incision line opening (ILO) is one of the most \ncommon complications resulting from dental implant surgery, \noccurring when a wound dehisces along a suture line (Fig. 11.1).\nThe prevalence of ILO has been shown in studies to range \nfrom 4.6% to 40% around submerged implants.1,2 In a study by \nMendoza, 37% had no ILO, while 43% had partial ILO, and 20% \nhad complete incision line opening.3 Soft tissue dehiscences \n(30%) have been shown to occur around membranes (barriers) \nwhen placed as part of guided bone regeneration procedures \n(GBR).4 Therefore, incision line opening is a common postop-\nerative complication after dental implant and bone grafting \nsurgery. In this chapter the etiologic factors, prevention, and \nmanagement of incision line opening will be discussed along \nwith a treatment protocol that is procedure and time speciic.\nCLASSIFICATION OF INCISION LINE \nOPENING COMPLICATIONS\nWhen placing root form implants with a two-stage approach, \nspontaneous early exposure of submerged implants has the \npotential for complications that may affect healing and \nosseointegration of the implants. A classiication and nomen-\nclature system for these exposures is useful for communica-\ntion and record keeping. Clinical wound opening has been \ncategorized by Tal et al (Box 11.1 and Fig. 11.2).2\nConsidering that spontaneous early exposures are com-\nplications that can potentially lead to mucositis or peri-\nimplantitis, Barbosa proposed classiication for spontaneous \nearly exposure of submerged implants based on diagnostic \nmethods and treatment modalities to prevent or intercept \nsuch complications. They suggested that implants with spon-\ntaneous exposure should immediately be surgically exposed \nas early as possible to prevent mucositis. A healing abutment \nshould be placed after the cover screw is removed (Fig. 11.3).5\nMORBIDITY CONSEQUENCES OF ILO WITH \nIMPLANTS AND BONE GRAFTING\nThe resultant consequences of ILO can vary depending on \nthe type of implant or bone grafting procedure. For implant \nplacement with good initial ixation, primary closure is \nfavored for one-stage surgery with placement of a permuco-\nsal abutment. For bone augmentation procedures, primary \nclosure is of paramount importance for clinicians when per-\nforming GBR techniques and autogenous onlay grafting \nprocedures. When incision line opening occurs during \nautogenous block grafting, there tends to be a greater poten-\ntial for delayed healing, loss of graft particles into the oral \ncavity, and increased risk of infection.\nExposure of nonresorbable membranes add additional \nrisk of infection and unsatisfactory results. If guided bone \nregeneration is performed in conjunction with implant place-\nment, ILO may also lead to loss of the implant. ILO most \nlikely will result in a bacterial smear layer on the implant \nbody, which may inhibit bone formation. Bone resorption \nresulting from infection may require implant removal. The \nsame degree of ILO, without simultaneous implant place-\nment, could possibly be managed and compensated for by \nbone expansion, use of slightly narrower implants, increased \nnumber of implants, and/or additional augmentation.\nImmediate Implants\nDental implants have become an accepted treatment modality \nwith immediate placement into fresh extraction sockets. ILO \nis typically not an issue when implants are placed in intact \nsockets with minimal voids because primary closure is not \nnecessary. Situations where implants are placed in nonintact \nsockets concomitant with bone grafting would be classiied \naccording to the dimension and architecture of osseous defects \n(similarly to delayed implant placement). ILO in alveolar ridges \nwith combined implant placement and signiicant augmenta-\ntion may be more vulnerable to compromised outcomes.\nEsthetic Consequences\nIn addition, ILO can negatively affect esthetic clinical out-\ncomes. The placement of implants simultaneous with regen-\nerative procedures adds the risk of a functional and esthetically \ncompromised result. For multistage bone augmentation pro-\ncedures, primary soft tissue healing allows for most predict-\nable outcomes. Incision technique, lap design, soft tissue \nhandling, and avoidance of transitional prosthesis pressure \nare key factors in avoiding ILO.\nPostoperative Care\nWound dehiscence may be associated with increased discom-\nfort and the need for closer monitoring.

The three phases of wound \nhealing are (1) inlammatory phase, (2) proliferation phase, \nand (3) maturation phase.\nInlammatory Phase.

This phase takes place the irst few \ndays after injury.\nWithin the irst few minutes after injury, platelets adhere \nto the site, become activated, and aggregate. These events are \nfollowed by activation of the coagulation cascade, which \nforms a clot of aggregated platelets in a mesh of cross-linked \nibrin protein. The blood vessels in the wound bed contract, \nforming a clot, which promotes hemostasis. The clot formed \nhas two functions: it temporarily protects the denuded tissues \nand serves as a provisional matrix for cell migration.\nThe blood clot consists of cellular components of blood \n(including red and white blood cells and platelets) in a matrix \nof ibrin, plasma ibronectin, vitronectin, and thrombospo-\nrin.7 Once hemostasis is achieved, dilation of the blood vessels \nwill result, allowing white blood cells, growth factors, \nantibodies, enzymes, and nutrients to invade the surgical \nwound. At this stage the characteristic signs of inlammation \nmay be seen: erythema, heat, edema, pain, and functional \ndisturbances. At the cellular level, neutrophils and macro-\nphages will initiate a host response, which will lyse and devi-\ntalize the necrotic tissue. The strength of the wound relies \nmainly on the integrity of the ibrin clot. Bacteria and cell \ndebris are phagocytized and removed from the wound by \nwhite blood cells.8\nProliferation Phase. The proliferation phase is characteris-\ntic with the formation of new granulation tissue, which is \nmainly comprised of collagen and extracellular matrix. The \nproliferation phase begins within 24 hours after injury and \nmay last 3 to 12 days. It is characterized by angiogenesis, col-\nlagen deposition, granulation tissue formation, epithelializa-\ntion, and wound contraction.

When the cells’ roles \nare close to complete (no longer needed), they are removed \nby apoptosis.9 During maturation and remodeling, collagen \nis remodeled and realigned along tension lines. There will \nalso be a reduction in the cellular activity as well as the \nnumber of blood vessels (Fig. 11.4).10,11\nKnowledge of the healing rates of the soft and hard tissues \nis useful to determine if a patient is healing on schedule. \nThe time for wound repair subsequent to surgery is tissue \nspeciic:\nEpithelium: heals at a rate of 0.5 to 1 mm per day (after \na 12-hour lag time)\nConnective tissue: heals 0.5 mm per day\nBone: heals at a rate of 50 µm per day, 1.5 mm per month\nMucoperiosteal ﬂap: adheres to bone (or soft tissue lap) \nby a ibrin clot (0 to 24 hours).12\nTypes of Wound Healing\nWith respect to wound healing, there exist three types: (1) \nprimary intention, (2) secondary intention, and (3) tertiary \nintention.\nPrimary Intention. With few exceptions, surgical procedures \nfor dental implantology involve surgical laps, which ideally \nresult in healing by primary intention. Healing by primary \nintention results when the wound edges are approximated \nand stabilized by sutures. Soft tissue laps are usually main-\ntained in positions that are “passive” and tension free. A \ncommon complication resulting in incision line opening is \nfor the clinician to utilize sutures to actively reposition muco-\nperiosteal laps. This may result in excessive tension placed \non the laps and may lead to ischemia and lap necrosis, which \nwill usually result in incision line opening.\nAchieving the goal of primary intention for closure will \nallow for hemostasis, less potential for infection and bone \nnecrosis, along with improved patient comfort. When ILO \noccurs, the only way for the wound to heal is via secondary \nintention, which may lead to increased morbidity.\nWound healing is a complex and intricate process where \nthe skin or tissues repair after injury. In the case of normal \nskin, the epidermis and dermis exist in a steady-state of equi-\nlibrium, forming a protective barrier against the external envi-\nronment. Once the protective barrier is broken, the physiologic \nprocess of wound healing is immediately set in motion. The \ngeneral principles of healing and the cellular and molecular \nevents observed in extraoral sites also apply to healing pro-\ncesses that take place following oral surgical procedures.13\nSecondary Intention. When wounds dehisce or ILO has \noccurred, the wound undergoes healing by secondary inten-\ntion. Secondary intention is healing by the body’s natural \nmechanisms, without surgical intervention. This typically \noccurs in large wounds with traumatic tissue loss or avulsion, \nso that wound edges are widely separated and cannot be \napposed. Healing occurs by clot formation, granulation, \ndeposition of collagen, and eventual epithelialization. Wound \ncontracture brings the wound margins together (Fig. 11.5).\nintention. In angiogenesis, vascular endothelial cells form \nnew blood vessels. In ibroplasia and granulation tissue for-\nmation, ibroblasts grow and form a new, provisional extra-\ncellular matrix (ECM) by excreting collagen and ibronectin. \nConcurrently, reepithelialization of the epidermis occurs, in \nwhich epithelial cells proliferate and migrate over the wound \nbed, providing cover for the new tissue.\nFor healthy granulation tissue to form ibroblasts, there \nmust be adequate levels of oxygen and nutrients available, \nwhich are supplied by the blood vessels. Characteristics of \nhealthy granulation tissue include a granular and uneven \nsurface that is pink and does not bleed easily. Epithelial cells \nwill begin to resurface on the surgical wound, which is termed \nepithelialization.\nMaturation Phase. Maturation phase is the inal phase in \nthe healing process and occurs when the wound has closed. \nThe remodeling of collagen from type III to type I will occur. \nDuring wound contraction, myoibroblasts decrease the size \nof the wound by gripping the wound edges and contracting, \nusing mechanisms that resemble smooth muscle cell contrac-\ntion. The wound scar gains strength and volume, and ery-\nthema decreases. Complete scar maturation and inal tensile \nFIG 11.3 Barbosa Incision Line Opening Classiication.

It is also appar-\nent that saliva provides a unique environment in the mouth \nconducive to rapid tissue repair. Reports indicate delayed \nhealing of oral wounds in patients with xerostomia or sialad-\nenectomized animals.17\nThere are several physicochemical factors in saliva that \nfavor gingival wound healing. These include appropriate pH, \nionic strength, and presence of ions such as calcium and \nmagnesium required for healing. Lubrication of oral mucosa \nprovided by saliva is also beneicial for wound healing.\nThe advantageous effects of maintaining a moist wound \nenvironment include prevention of tissue dehydration and \ncell death, accelerated angiogenesis, and increased breakdown \nof ibrin and tissue debris. The use of hydrocolloid occlusive \ndressings may facilitate cutaneous wound healing. Saliva-\ntreated wounds undergo shorter inlammatory reactions and \nfaster epithelial coverage, as well as faster connective tissue \nregeneration. Moisture and ionic strength may be primary \nfactors in saliva that promote tissue repair and are important \nfor overall wound healing. This potential is probably due to \nthe presence of several elements in saliva including growth \nfactors and bacteria.18\nTertiary Intention. A third type of healing has been described \nas tertiary intention. Tertiary intention healing occurs when \nprimary closure is delayed, allowing the wound to granulate \nfor a short period of time. The wound is then reapproximated \nmanually or by another technique. This method has been \ntermed delayed primary closure and can be used to debride \nan infected, acute wound prior to closure.14 This type of \nhealing is uncommon with respect to dental implants and \nbone grafts.\nFACTORS THAT AFFECT WOUND HEALING/\nINCISION LINE OPENING\nSALIVA\nAs concluded by animal studies, wound healing in oral \nmucosa is faster and results in less scarring in comparison to \nextraoral sites. Oral wound healing is enhanced by factors \npresent in saliva and by speciic microlora of the oral cavity.15 \nAdditionally, the properties of cells involved in tissue regen-\neration in oral mucosa are unique and share properties of \nfetal cells.16 The observations suggest that several cell func-\ntions important in tissue repair are shared by fetal and gin-\ngival ibroblasts, which differ from dermal ibroblasts.\nFIG 11.4 (A–B) Time-related phases of wound healing showing various components of the \nhealing process. \nVasoconstriction\nA\nB\nInflammation\nProliferation\nMaturation\nVasodilation\nCellular response\nReepithelial-\nization\nInjury\n0.3\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n1\n3\n10\nTime (days)\n% of Maximum Response\n30\nWound\nContraction\nCollagen\nAccumulation\n100\n30 minutes 1 day\n1 week\n2 weeks 3 weeks\n6 months\n1 year\nFibroplasia: collagen synthesis\nWound contraction\nScar: collagen remodeling\nMaturation/remodeling phase\nInflammatory phase\nProliferative phase"

These indings imply that the potential for peri-\nodontal repair depends both on bacterial lora and the indi-\nvidual cell populations of periodontal wounds.\nTreatment Implications\nWound healing may be delayed and directly inluenced \nby bacteria type.

Additionally, many medications including \nanticoagulants, immunosuppressants, and bisphosphonates \nmay increase the risk of surgical wound healing. This under-\nscores the importance of a thorough medical consultation \nprior to any implant surgical procedure.\nLOCAL/LIFESTYLE-RELATED FACTORS\nSmoking\nIn the United States, approximately 45 million adults and \n21% of the population smokes cigarettes. Approximately 23% \nof men and 19% of women smoke cigarettes. Tobacco use has \nbeen implicated in many adverse systemic outcomes, includ-\ning tooth loss and dental implant failure.23 In fact, the entire \nstomatognathic system suffers from the effect of tobacco \nbyproducts.\nTobacco smoke decreases polymorphonuclear leukocyte \nactivity, resulting in lower motility, a lower rate of chemotac-\ntic migration, and reduced phagocytic activity. These condi-\ntions contribute to a decreased resistance to inlammation, \ninfection, and impaired wound healing potential.24\nSmoking is also associated with decreased calcium absorp-\ntion. Additional indings demonstrate a reduced mineral \ncontent in the bone of aging smokers and, to a greater degree, \nin postmenopausal female smokers. The association of \ntobacco with intraoral carcinoma is well recognized.\nWhen incision line opening after surgery occurs, smoking \ndelays secondary wound healing, may contaminate bone \ngrafts, and contributes to early bone loss during healing. \nTreatment planning for any type of dental implant surgery \nshould emphasize the need for smoking cessation protocols.\nAlcohol Use\nEthyl alcohol is one of the most widely used mood-altering \ndrugs in the world. More than 95% of smokers also drink \nalcohol. Alcoholism has been associated with diseases such as \nliver and metabolic dysfunction, bone marrow suppression \nresulting in bleeding complications, predisposition to infec-\ntion, and delayed soft tissue healing.25 The direct effect on \nbone includes decreased formation, increased resorption, \ndecreased osteoblast function, decreased wound healing, and \nincreased parathyroid hormone secretion, which leads to \nlower bone density. However, it has been shown that with-\ndrawal of alcohol can reverse the negative effects on osteo-\nblast function in a matter of days.26 Additionally, the use of \nalcohol immediately after surgery may predispose the surgical \nwound to decreased healing.\nObesity\nObesity is a major challenge for health care personnel caring \nfor these patients. Obesity is a chronic disease, emerging as a \nmajor epidemic public health problem. In 2008, 35% of adults \n(age 20+) were overweight (body mass index [BMI] ± 25 kg/\nm2), and the prevalence of obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) has \ndoubled since 1980, affecting an estimated 502 million people.\nIn general, obese patients are at increased risk for wound \nhealing complications such as seroma, hematoma, infection, \nprophylactic antibiotics should be utilized during the pre- \nand postoperative treatment phase.\nSYSTEMIC DISEASES\nSystemic diseases are a vital component of treatment plan-\nning and implant therapy. Speciic systemic diseases and con-\nditions affect wound healing and bone metabolism, either of \nwhich can have a direct impact on the success of implant \ntherapy. Diabetes mellitus is a major endocrine disorder \ncommonly reported by approximately 10% patients. With \ndiabetes-associated insulin deiciency or metabolism defects, \nglucose remains in the bloodstream and increases blood \nglucose levels. Diabetic patients are at risk to develop infec-\ntions and vascular complications. The healing process is \naffected by impaired vascular function, impaired cell chemo-\ntaxis, and impaired neutrophil function. Protein metabolism \nis decreased, and healing of soft and hard tissue is delayed. \nNerve regeneration is altered, and angiogenesis is impaired.\nMany non–life-threatening diseases and conditions \nrequire medications for deinitive management or control of \npotential wound healing complications. Common examples \ninclude anticoagulants, immunosuppressants, and bisphos-\nphonates. Bleeding problems encountered when incising and \nrelecting tissue for passive closure may be complicated by \nanticoagulants.\nHowever, given the potential life-threatening complica-\ntions of discontinuing anticoagulants such as warfarin, this is \nusually not recommended as long as the therapeutic drug \nlevels are within normal limits. However, special attention \nmust be devoted to good surgical technique and use of appro-\npriate local hemostatic measures to control bleeding.\nTwo classes of immunosuppressants frequently prescribed \nfor patients are glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) and cyto-\nstatics (chemotherapeutic agents). The negative impact of \nthese medications on wound healing can be mitigated by \nappropriate patient selection, timing of treatment, and \nmedical consultation.\nBisphosphonates can also lead to wound dehiscence fol-\nlowing surgery. These drugs act by suppressing and reducing \nbone resorption by osteoclasts and are used to treat bone \ndisorders including osteoporosis, metastatic bone cancer, and \nPaget disease (JBS igures on bone metabolism). After surgery \ninvolving the jaws, bone exposure may develop rather than \nthe normal soft tissue closure healing mechanisms.21 This is \ncommon with more potent nitrogen-containing intravenous \nbisphosphonates, and the prevalence is lower with oral \nbisphosphonates.22 However, the clinician must be able to \ndifferentiate bone exposure of this bisphosphonate origin \nand insuficient lap closure or postextraction bony spicule \nformation.\nTreatment Implications\nSystemic diseases play a signiicant role in the healing process \nafter dental implant and bone-grafting procedures. The most \ncommon systemic disease that affects healing is diabetes, \nwhich, if uncontrolled, may lead to signiicant postoperative"

Patients should be educated on the use of denture \nadhesives in approximation to the surgical wound because \nthis will most likely decrease healing and lead to incision line \nopening.\nPREVENTION OF INCISION LINE OPENING\nGOOD SURGICAL TECHNIQUE\nTo minimize and promote optimum wound healing and \ndecrease the possibility of incision line opening, the following \nsurgical principals should be adhered to.\nIncision in Keratinized Tissue\nThe primary incision should ideally be located be in keratin-\nized tissue whenever possible. This permits increased wound \nsurface area and a resultant increase in vascularity to the inci-\nsion. Not only does this reduce the initial intraoral bleeding, \nit also severs smaller blood vessels and reduces postoperative \nedema, which may add tension to the incision line. If there is \n3 mm or more of attached gingiva on the crest of the eden-\ntulous ridge, the incision bisects this tissue. This places half \nof the attached gingiva width on each side of the incision. If \nthere is less than 3 mm of attached keratinized tissue on the \ncrest, the incision is made more lingually so that at least \n1.5 mm of the attached tissue is placed to the facial aspect of \nthe implant. This concept is very important in the posterior \nmandible because attached tissue is needed to prevent tension \nand pulling from the buccinator muscle (Fig. 11.6).29\nBroad-Based Incision Design\nThe apex or tip of the lap should never be wider than the \nbase (e.g., converge from base to the apex). This will maintain \nand wound dehiscence. Cardiovascular problems associated \nwith this condition may contribute to ischemia by providing \ninsuficient oxygen and nutrients to the tissue, which may \nlead to tissue necrosis.\nRespiratory issues may impair vital capacity and tidal func-\ntion, which by compromising tissue oxygenation may \nadversely affect wound healing. The higher incidence of infec-\ntion and the likelihood of other concomitant chronic non-\nhealing wounds may diminish immune and healing responses. \nOral wound healing may also be affected by obesity.27 Suvan \nand coworkers found that BMI and obesity appeared to be \nindependent predictors of poor response following periodon-\ntal therapy.28 In addition, technical dificulties in operating \non obese patients, including extended operating times, may \nincrease risk of wound contamination. Because of patient \npositioning, airway complications may result.\nTreatment Implications. Lifestyle-related issues such as \nalcohol use and smoking may decrease wound healing after \ndental implant and bone grafting procedures. It is imperative \nthe patient be informed that these lifestyle issues may lead to \nslower wound healing and an increased possibility of incision \nline opening. Additionally, physical characteristics may pre-\ndispose the patient to complication related issues.\nPERIODONTAL BIOTYPE\nAlthough some studies report minimal long-term effects of \ntissue biotype on bone grafting and implant success, thicker \nbiotypes may prevent tissue breakdown or tears during sutur-\ning. Tissue augmentation should be considered for patients \nwith preexisting thin tissue biotypes. With thick biotype \ntissue, there exists more keratinized tissue, which results in \nbetter healing, easier suturing, and less likelihood of wound \nbreakdown.\nTreatment Implications\nThe patient’s tissue biotype should always be evaluated prior \nto surgery. Patients with a thin biotype may need soft tissue \naugmentation prior to or in conjunction with dental implant \nand bone grafting procedures. Patients with compromised \ntissue biotypes may predispose the patient to esthetic related \nissues, especially if located in the esthetic zone (e.g., maxillary \nanterior).\nPOSTOPERATIVE ISSUES\nDespite meticulous surgery, deliberate or accidental behavior \npatterns by patients may contribute to incision line opening. \nFailure to modify the diet to a soft consistency or attempted \nvisualization of surgical sites may traumatize or place \nincreased tension on the incision, resulting in incision line \ndehiscence. It is also paramount that the clinician modify any \ntransitional prosthesis that may come in close approximation \nwith an incision line, while also advising the patient on the \nproper use of these prostheses, which may include cessation \nearly in the healing process.

Additionally, the base of the lap should \nnot have signiicant pressure or be excessively stretched or \ntwisted, which may compromise the blood supply (Fig. 11.7).30\nAllow for Adequate Access\nThe lap should be large enough to provide adequate visual-\nization of the surgical site and allow for the insertion of \ninstruments to perform the surgical procedure. If the lap is \ntoo small, a retractor will not be able to maintain the lap \nwithout excessive pressure. Excessive retraction pressure will \nlead to increased inlammation, which may compromise the \nhealing of the incision line (Fig. 11.8).\nVertical Release Incision to Maintain Blood \nSupply and Decrease Tension on Flap\nThe blood supply to the relected lap should be maintained \nwhenever possible. The primary blood supply to the facial \nlap, which is most often the lap relected for an implant or \nbone graft, is from the unkeratinized mobile mucosa. This is \nFIG 11.7 Flap design showing a broad-based design allowing \nfor minimal tension on the lap. \nFIG 11.8 Flap should allow for adequate access to decrease \ntissue trauma with minimal tissue tension. \nFIG 11.9 (A) Posterior mandibular incision depicting crestal \nincision with anterior and posterior release.

Therefore, vertical \nrelease incisions are made to the height of the mucogingival \njunction, and the facial lap is relected only 5 mm above the \nheight of the mucogingival junction. Both of these incision \napproaches maintain more blood supply to the facial lap. In \naddition, incisions and relection in the mobile alveolar \nmucosa increase lap retraction during initial healing, which \nmay contribute to incision line opening and may increase risk \nof scar formation and delayed healing of the incision line as \na consequence of reduced blood supply.\nVertical release incisions should not be made over bony \nprominences (e.g., canine eminence) because this will increase \ntension on the incision line and may increase the possibility \nof incision line opening (Fig. 11.9).\nMaintain Flap Margins Over Bone\nThe soft tissue lap design should also have the margins of \nthe wound over host bone whenever possible.

This improves the early vascularization to the incision \nline and adhesion of the margins to reduce retraction during \ninitial healing (Fig. 11.10).\nClean, Concise Incision\nA clean incision is made through the tissue in one direction \nwith even pressure of the scalpel. A sharp blade of proper size \n(i.e., #15 blade) should be used to be make clean, concise \nincisions without traumatizing the tissue from repeated passes \nor strokes. Tentative strokes, especially in different planes, will \nincrease the amount of damaged tissue and increase the \namount of bleeding. Long, continuous strokes are preferable \nto shorter, inconsistent, and interrupted strokes.31\nSharp dissection will minimize trauma to the incision line, \nwhich will result in easier closure. Ideally, the incision should \nalways be over bone. Care should be noted of vital underlying \nnerves, blood vessels, and associated muscles. Scalpel blades \ndull rather easily, especially when used on bone and tissue \nwith greater resistance. The clinician should change blades \nwhen dulling is suspected to decrease tissue trauma.\nThe incision should be made with the blade held perpen-\ndicular to the epithelial surface. This will result in an angle \nthat produces square wound margins that are easier to reori-\nent during suturing and less likely for surgical wound necro-\nsis to occur (Fig. 11.11).\nFull Thickness Relection and Ideal  \nFlap Elevation\nIdeally, the lap should be full thickness and include the \nsurface mucosa, submucosa, and the periosteum. The perios-\nteum is necessary for healing; the replacement of the perios-\nteum in its original position will increase healing.\nTissue elevation should be completed with extreme care. \nTo minimize trauma to the soft tissue, meticulous handling \nis required. Proper use of appropriate tissue forceps, avoid-\nance of excessive suctioning by the assistant, and “tieback” \nsutures all contribute to improved lap management.

The vertical incisions are made on the facial \naspect of the edentulous site and begin 1 mm below the \nmucogingival junction, within the keratinized tissue. Extend-\ning the vertical incisions beyond the mucogingival junction \nincreases the risk of scar formation at the incision site. The \nfull-thickness incision then approaches the crest of the eden-\ntulous site, leaving 1.0 to 1.5 mm of the interproximal papilla \nadjacent to each tooth.

If drying of the \ntissues occurs, there is less likelihood that complete wound \nclosure will occur. If the tissue margins become desiccated, \nperiodic irrigations with sterile saline (0.9% sodium chlo-\nride) or a saline-moistened gauze may be used.\nRelieving Tissue (Tension Free)\nExcessive lap tension is the most frequent etiologic factor \ncausing incision line opening. This is best prevented by appro-\npriate incision and lap design, the use of periosteal releasing \nincisions, and blunt dissection (“tissue stretching”). Past tech-\nniques to expand tissue primarily used a more apical tissue \nrelection and horizontal scoring of the periosteum parallel to \nthe primary incision. Historically, the vestibular approach by \nBranemark allowed for optimal visualization of anatomic \nlandmarks, suturing remote from the surgical area, complete \ntissue coverage, as well as predictable primary closure and \nhealing.33 The postoperative disadvantages of this approach \ninclude distortion of the vestibule and other anatomic land-\nmarks, edema, dificult suture removal, and cumulative patient \ndiscomfort.34 Langer and Langer documented the use of over-\nlapping partial thickness laps. This approach results in exten-\nsion of the coronal aspect of the buccal or palatal lap, allowing \nprimary intention closure around the site in an overlapping \nmanner.35 This is usually effective for primary closure when less \nthan 5-mm advancement of the lap is necessary (Fig. 11.14).\nA submucosal space technique developed by Misch \nin the early 1980s is an effective method to expand tissue over \nlarger grafts (greater than 15 × 10 mm in height and width) \n(Box 11.2).36\nThe utility of periosteal incision for gaining lap release \nwas studied by Park.37 He found laps could be advanced up \nto 171.3% (more than one and a half times longer than its \noriginal length) by two vertical incisions and a periosteal \nreleasing incision (PRI) under a minimal tension of 5 g, while \none or two vertical incisions without PRI could advance the \nlap only 113.4% and 124.2%, respectively. These results sug-\ngested that PRI can be predictably used to attain tension-free \nprimary closure under a minimal pulling tension of laps.\nCONFIRM COVER SCREW COMPLETELY \nTIGHTENED (TWO STAGE)\nA common postoperative complication that leads to incision \nline breakdown and infection is the inadequate placement of \nthe cover screw for two-stage implant procedures. Any micro-\ngap between the cover screw and implant leads to bacterial \ncolonization and tissue irritation. This will most likely result in \nswelling directly over the implant. Prior to suturing, the cover \nscrew should be checked to conirm total seating (Fig. 11.16).\nUTILIZATION OF IDEAL SUTURING \nMATERIALS AND TECHNIQUES\nThe objective of the proper suturing of the surgical wound is \nto position and secure the margins of the incisions to promote \nFIG 11.14 Stretchering or relieving the tissue for primary \nclosure.

The goal of the suture material and \ntechnique is to hold the margins of the wound in close appo-\nsition until the wound has healed enough to withstand \nnormal functional tension and stress on the incision line. If \nsurgical wounds are not properly approximated, separation \nof the margins will occur, which leads to increased postsurgi-\ncal morbidity. The clinician must select a suture with qualities \nthat include high tensile strength, tissue biocompatibility that \nprevents tissue irritation, ease of knot tying, and the ability \nto prevent minimal knot slippage (Table 11.1)."

It is not recommended when the tissues are \nadvanced for a bone augmentation.38 Hypersensitivity reac-\ntions have been shown to occur because of the chromate \nparticles present in the suture.39\nSynthetic. Synthetic sutures are broken down by hydrolysis \nbecause of their hydrophobic nature. The most common syn-\nthetic, absorbable suture in implant dentistry is polyglycolic \nacid (PGA) (Fig. 11.18).\nPolyglycolic acid (Vicryl). Because PGA sutures are \nabsorbed by hydrolysis breakdown, they are not affected by a \nlow pH. Because they are manufactured by synthetic poly-\nmers, their resorption is slower and they will maintain the \nincision line with a tensile strength much longer than most \nsuture materials. This suture material will maintain suficient \ntension over the irst 2 weeks (75%), 50% after 3 weeks, and \n25% after 2 weeks.40 PGA sutures have varying resorption \nrates, which consist of regular breakdown (≈21–28 days) and \nfast absorbing (≈7–14 days). The suture material is inert and \nhas a relatively low tissue reaction.\nNonabsorbable. Nonabsorbable sutures are composed of \nmanmade materials, which are not metabolized by the body. \nThe most commonly used nonresorbable suture in dentistry \nSUTURE TYPE\nAbsorbable\nAbsorbable sutures are very popular and advantageous in \nimplant dentistry because of the elimination of a suture \nremoval appointment. There are two types of resorbable \nsutures: natural and synthetic.\nNatural. Natural sutures are mainly broken down by body \nenzymes. The most common natural sutures are the plain and \nchromic gut (Fig. 11.17).\nPlain gut. Plain gut is a monoilament derived from \nhighly puriied collagen from sheep intestinal submucosa. It \nis highly antigenic, losing 50% of tensile strength after 24 \nhours. Gut has unpredictable absorption because of the \nenzymes and macrophages that break it down. This type of \nsuture has been shown to have a high incidence of tissue \nreactions, which impede healing.\nChromic gut. Chromic gut is also derived from puriied \ncollagen from sheep intestinal submucosa that is treated with \nchromic salts, which decrease absorption. This material is \nhighly antigenic and loses 50% of tensile strength after 5 days. \nAs a monoilament it causes signiicant tissue reactivity. \nChromic gut causes inlammation, loses tension, and resorbs \nFIG 11.17 (A) Plain gut.

Sutures derived from a biologic origin (i.e., \nplain and chromic gut) are digested by intraoral enzymes. \nUsually these types of sutures lose their tensile strength very \nfast (within days of surgery) and are not ideal for dental \nimplant procedures. Secondly, these sutures may break down \neven faster when the intraoral pH is low. A decreased pH may \nresult from infection, medications, metabolic disorders, or \ndry mouth. Trauma from suture removal may sometimes lead \nto incision line opening.\nTreatment Implications. The ideal suture material should \nexhibit a high tensile strength, low tissue reactivity, and be \nabsorbable. In implant dentistry, this would include the use \nof PGA or polyglycolic acid. A nonresorbable alternative \nwould be a PTFE suture (e.g., Cytoplast), which exhibit a high \ntensile strength and is nonwicking.\nSUTURE SIZE\nSurgical threads are classiied by diameter ranging from 1 \nto 10, with the highest number being the smallest thread \nsize. In implant dentistry, the most common diameter is 3-0 \nfor incision lines and 4-0 or 5-0 around tissue release \nmargins or areas that exhibit thinner tissue. In some situa-\ntions, a 2-0 suture will be used, usually as a tie-back for \nthe lingual tissue when performing mandibular surgery. \nIdeally, the smallest-diameter suture material that will \nadequately hold the tissue in approximation should be \nused. As diameters of suture decrease, so do their respective \ntensile strengths.\nSUTURE NEEDLE\nThe surgical needle is composed of three parts: (1) point, (2) \nneedle body, and (3) swaged end. The needle is type is clas-\nsiied by the curvature, radius, and shape. The most com-\nmonly used suture needles in implant dentistry are the 38 and \n12 circle needles.43\nThe 38 needle allows for the passage of the needle from \nbuccal to lingual in one pass. The 12 is usually used in more \nrestrictive areas such as maxillary molars and in periosteal \nand mucogingival surgery.44 The clinician should always be \naware that there exist two types of needle designs: reverse \ncutting and conventional. In implant dentistry, the reverse \ncutting should always be used because this will minimize \nsevering of the tissues. The reverse cutting needle has a \nsmooth inner curvature with its third cutting edge located on \nits convex (outer) edge (Fig. 11.20).\nSUTURING TECHNIQUE\nInterrupted\nSimple Loop. The simple loop is the most common suture \nused in implant dentistry. It is used to approximate mobile \nsurgical laps in edentulous areas. Each suture is tied and cut \nPolypropylene (i.e., prolene): This suture, which is a \nmonoilament, will not lose tensile strength over time. It is \ninert, has very little tissue reaction, possesses a low coefi-\ncient of friction, passes through tissue very easily, and has \ngood knot security. The main disadvantage of this suture \nmaterial tissue is irritation from the cut ends of the suture \nmaterial.\nPolytetraﬂuoroethylene: The polytetraluoroethylene \n(PTFE) suture material is a monoilament, which has a rela-\ntively high tensile strength and is nonwicking (low bacteria \naccumulation). Additionally, PTFE sutures have good han-\ndling qualities, are easy to tie with excellent knot security, are \nsoft and comfortable for patients, and are biologically inert. \nThe main disadvantage of PTFE is that it is very expensive. \nPTFE sutures are slippery and have poor frictional resistance \nto knot loosening. At least seven equally tensioned, lat square \nthrows are required to produce a secure knot when using \nPTFE material.\nSUTURE QUALITIES\nThe selection of the suture material should be made with \nregards to the location and type of surgical procedure pro-\nvided. However, an ideal suture material should exhibit:\nHigh Tensile Strength\nHigh tensile strength is the measured force, in pounds, that \nthe suture will withstand prior to breaking. A suture material \nwith low tensile strength will lead to suture breakdown, which \nwill most likely compromise the healing of the incision line. \nThe tensile strength of the tissue to be sutured will ideally \ndetermine the tensile strength of the suture selected. The \ntensile strength of the suture should be at least as strong as \nthe tensile strength of the tissue being sutured.\nLow Tissue Reactivity\nTissue reaction from the suture material has been shown to \nbe exhibited through an inlammatory response, which will \nusually develop during the irst 2 to 7 days after suturing the \ntissue. The suture material selected should have an inherent \nlow tissue reactivity.42a Low tissue reactivity means that the \nsuture material should exhibit a minimal inlammatory \nresponse, which will not delay wound healing nor increase \ninfection rate. Tissue reaction is relected through an inlam-\nmatory response, which develops during the irst 2 to 7 days \nafter suturing the tissue.1-3 Several studies published over the \npast four decades have reported that synthetic materials \nexhibit a superior behavior to oral tissues in terms of tissue \ninlammatory reactions compared to nonsynthetic suture \nmaterial.\nAbsorbable\nAbsorbable suture material allows for the convenience of no \nsuture removal. These types of sutures undergo degradation \nand absorption in the tissues; thus the sutures do not have to \nbe removed. There are two mechanisms of degradation of"

These two sutures (one on each \nside) hold the tissue at the level of the suture groove and \nprevent it from lifting up and over the healing cap during soft \ntissue healing.\nContinuous\nSoft tissue spans necessitating four or more interrupted \nsutures are best approximated with continuous nonlocking \nsutures. This suture design places less tension on the \nsuture line and soft tissue and allows faster vasculariza-\ntion of the relected soft tissue laps. However, whether \nlocking or nonlocking, this suture knot has a tendency \nto loosen with uneven distribution of tension, which \nresults in a compromise to the integrity of the suture knot \n(Fig. 11.24).\nHorizontal/Vertical Mattress\nMattress sutures are a variation of the interrupted suture and \nare used most commonly where there exists muscle pull or \nhigh tension. This type of suturing technique will evert the \nsurgical wound edges, which keeps the epithelium away from \nunderlying structures and maintains the tissue laps to the \nunderlying structures (i.e., dental implant, graft material, \nmembrane).45\nThere are two types of mattress suture, horizontal and \nvertical. Both of these suture types allow for greater tension \nto be applied on the soft tissue closure without risk of tearing \nthe soft tissue lap. It should be emphasized they are not used \nto obtain primary closure when tension on the soft tissue \nlaps is present at surgery. The tissues should rest passively \ntogether before suturing. However, during functional/\nparafunctional movement of the tissues, the tension on the \nincision line may be reduced with a horizontal mattress \nsuture. They are often used in the mandible when the loor \nof the mouth is in proximity to the lingual lap and the tissue \nis thin. They may also be used on a facial lap with a strong \nmuscle pull on the soft tissue. In addition, horizontal mattress \nsutures evert the soft tissue margin and ensure primary \nclosure without epithelium entrapment. A combination of \na few horizontal mattress sutures with a continuous suture \nafter insertion through the tissue. The disadvantage of this \nsuture is it is more time consuming than a continuous suture. \nHowever, it does have the advantage that, if one of the sutures \nwould loosen or break, the remaining sutures would most \nlikely hold the wound together to minimize wound dehis-\ncence (Fig. 11.21).\nFigure-Eight. The igure-eight suture is placed as a simple \nloop on the buccal; however, on the lingual, the needle passes \nthrough the outer aspect of the lap. The main disadvantage \nof the igure-eight is the suture material is interposed \nbetween the laps after full closure. The igure-eight suture is \nmost commonly used with extraction sites and around \npapilla (Fig. 11.22).\nSecond Stage Surgery: Permucosal Abutment Suturing.

Care should be exercised not to crush or sever the \ntissue. There are various types of tissue pick-ups with the \nserrated being the most popular. The 1 × 2 tip will usually \nresult in tearing of the tissue, especially when the tissue is thin \n(Fig. 11.33).\nNeedle Holders\nMost needle holders are made from stainless steel, titanium, \nand tungsten carbide tipped. The tungsten carbide tipped \nneedle holders tend to deform the suture needle the least \namount. Correct use of needle holders includes:\n• Always use the appropriate-size needle holder for the \nsize of the needle. The larger the needle size, the wider \nand heavier the needle holders should be. In contrast, \nwith thinner tissue with a smaller size needle and suture \nmaterial, smaller, more delicate needle holders are \nrecommended (e.g., Castroviejo).\n• Avoid placement of the needle holders near the swage \nor eye of the needle. Needles should be grasped approx-\nimately 14 to 12 their length from the swaged area.\n• Check the alignment of the needle holder tips, making \nsure there is no opening between the tips. The needle \nshould not be able to rock, twist, or turn within the \nneedle holder tips.\n• Always close the needle holder on the irst or second \nratchet. If the needle is grasped too tightly, the needle \nmay break or weaken. Hemostats should never be used \nas a replacement for needle holders because they will \ndamage the suture needle and material (Fig. 11.34).\nSuture Scissors\nThere exist many different types of scissors that may be used \nin the suturing process.

(J) Clinical Image of Continu-\nous Suture. \nBOX 11.3 Basic Suturing Principles\n1. Suture from mobile to immobile tissues: Allows for better \ncontrol and manipulation of the tissue (Fig. 11.27A).\n2. Don’t hold needle at swage: This may result in bending \nof the needle (Fig. 11.27B).\n3. Enter tissue at 90 degrees: This allows for easier passage \nof the needle through the tissue and prevents tearing \n(Fig. 11.27C).\n4. Keep ingers in needle holder (index inger for security): \nUsually the thumb and index ingers are used to hold the \nneedle holder. The ingers should always remain in the \nneedle holders because this will expedite the suturing \nprocess \nalong \nwith \nallowing \nfor \nbetter \ncontrol \n(Fig. 11.28A–B).\n5. Enter 2–3 mm and exit from tissue margin: Less than \n2 mm will lead to tearing of the tissue margin (Fig. 11.29)\n6. Suture 3–5 mm apart: Too many sutures will impair blood \nsupply to the incision line and increase possibility of ILO \n(see Fig. 11.29).\n7. First throw must lie lat: After the irst loop is tied, it is \nmandatory the loop lie lat. If folded, the loop will lose \ntension and knot security will be lost. Final tension of the \nirst tie should be as horizontal as possible (Fig. 11.30).\n8. Avoid excessive tension: Tying knots too tight leads to \ntissue ischemia and ILO. Knot tension should not cause \ntissue blanching. In tying the knot, a “sawing” motion \nshould be avoided because this will result in weakening \nthe integrity of the suture,\n9. Evert tissue, not invert: This makes it less likely that ILO \nwill occur (Fig. 11.31).\n10. Cut sutures approximately 2–3 mm at completion of knot: \nLess than 2 mm leads to loss of knot tension and more \nthan 3 mm leads to patient irritation. When the ends are \ntoo long, patients will tend to irritate the area with their \ntongue (Fig. 11.32).\n11. Completed knot: The inal knot should be tight and irm \nso that slippage will not occur. Ideally, the smallest knot \npossible should be used to prevent tissue and foreign \nbody reactions.\nsuture scissors that are used for cutting sutures, especially for \nremoving sutures postoperatively (Fig. 11.35). When using \nsuture scissors to cut the ends of the tied knot, make sure \nboth tips of the scissors are visible to avoid inadvertently \ncutting tissue beyond the suture.\nSUTURING KNOTS\nSurgical suture knot tying is the most important aspect of \nsuturing and often the most common problematic area. Sur-\ngical knots in the oral cavity must be particularly secure to \novercome the potential of loosening with saliva and normal \nfunction.46 There are three components of a sutured knot: (1) \nloop, which is created by the knot; (2) knot, which is com-\nposed of multiple throws, each which represents a weave of \ntwo strands; and (3) ears, which are composed of the cut ends \nof the suture.47 For knots to be effective, they must contain \nall three parts and possess attributes of both knot security \nand loop security. Knot security is deined as the eficacy of \nthe knot at resisting slippage when load is applied. This \ndepends on three factors: friction, internal interference, and \nslack between suture throws.\nLoop security is the ability to maintain a tight suture \nloop as a knot is tied.48 Any tied knot may have good knot \nsecurity but poor loop security (a loose suture loop). Loose \nsuture loops may be ineffective in approximating tissue edges \nto be secured.\nIdeally, the knot should have minimal volume and be tied \nso that it fails only by breakage, rather than by slippage. A \nthree-throw surgeon’s knot square (2/1/1) should be used.49\nSecurity of the knot will depend on the material used, the \ndepth and location of the wound, and the amount of stress \nthat will be placed on the wound postoperatively. Operator \nexperience is an important factor because considerable varia-\ntion may result between knots tied by different surgeons and \neven between knots tied by the same individual on different \noccasions (Fig. 11.36).50\nText continued on p. 432"

With synthetic resorbable \nand nonabsorbable synthetic suture materials, a modiied sur-\ngeon’s knot is recommended.51 For most dental implant pro-\ncedures, the surgical knot of choice is the modiied surgeon’s \nknot. The basic surgeon’s knot is composed of two overhand \nknots.

This pressure may reduce postoperative bleed-\ning under the lap, which may cause “dead spaces” and delayed \nhealing. Any stagnant blood under the lap is “milked” from \nunder the soft tissue by gentle pressure. This also allows the \nibrin formation from the platelets to help “glue” the lap to \nthe graft site (Fig. 11.38).\nFIG 11.37 Bone graft material must be removed from within \nthe incision line to prevent wound dehiscence. \nFIG 11.38 Gentle light pressure to minimize dead spaces \nafter suture completion decreases the possibility of bacteria \naccumulation. \nDECREASE INFLAMMATION\nSystemic corticosteroids or nonsteroidal antiinlammatory \nmedications (NSAIDs) may be administered before and after \nsurgery to decrease soft tissue edema because edema has been \nshown to contribute to incision line opening.\nTRANSITIONAL AND INTERIM  \nPROSTHESIS DESIGN\nOcclusal forces applied to a removable prosthesis over a \nhealing implant or graft site may also cause incision line \nopening of soft tissues and delay wound healing. Without \nappropriate adjustment, these forces can easily result in \nILO by compressing the surgical area during function \nbefore suture removal. The potential for crestal bone loss is \nincreased during any graft healing or around implants \nduring stage I healing, which may lead to implant failure \nfrom early loading. Although use of such prostheses should \nbe discouraged, other strategies to minimize or eliminate \nthis possibility would include extensive relief of the intaglio \nsurface, lange elimination, and use of tissue conditioners. \nMuch more preferable provisional tooth replacement(s) \nwould be either tooth or implant (transitional) supported \n(Fig. 11.39).\nOther examples of ixed transitionals would include the \nbonding of natural tooth crowns or denture teeth to the teeth \nbounding the edentulous space and modiication of existing \nixed partial denture, i.e., pontic shortening. Removable tran-\nsitional prostheses such as an Essix retainer or Snap On Smile \nprosthesis are frequently utilized due to their rigid support \nand resultant lack of pressure on the incision line. A resin-\nbonded ixed restoration can also be fabricated to provide \nimproved function, especially when crestal bone regeneration \nis performed.\nThe prosthesis may depress the interdental papillae of \nadjacent teeth. As a result, a resin-bonded ixed prosthesis is \nfabricated for the extended healing, and a removable device \nmay be used short term for cosmetic emergencies (if the \nprosthesis debonds).\nWhen a resin-bonded restoration is used, the adjacent \nteeth are not prepared and the device is bonded to teeth below \nthe centric occlusal contacts. The interdental papillae are \noften depressed after initial socket healing. This type of tran-\nsitional restoration for the single-tooth implant has the mul-\ntiple beneits of being off the soft tissue drape, the developing \nbone augmented site, and the healing implant-bone interface. \nSeveral options to the resin-bonded device permit these goals. \nAn Essix appliance is an acrylic shell, similar to a bleaching \ntray, that has a denture tooth attached to replace the missing \ntooth. This prosthesis is the simplest treatment for tooth \nreplacement postsurgery.\nWhen an adjacent tooth requires a crown in the overall \ntreatment plan, the adjacent tooth may be prepared and a \ncantilevered transitional ixed partial denture with a pontic \nover the surgical site may be used.

Suture \nremoval should include the following steps:\n1. Patient rinses lightly with 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate.\n2. With tissue pick-ups, hold up the knot end of the suture \nand cut the suture closest to the tissue. Care should be \nexercised to not traumatize or irritate the surgical wound.\n3. Gently pull the suture out with the knot outside of the \ntissue. Do not pull the knot through the tissue to remove.\n4. Have the patient rinse with 0.12% chlorhexidine. Evaluate \nand make sure the interim prosthesis does not impinge on \nthe surgical wound (Fig. 11.40).\nDECREASE THE POSSIBILITY OF INFECTION\nAntibiotics\nAn important complication to prevent after implant surgery \nis infection. Infection can lead to a multitude of problems, \nincluding pain, swelling, loss of bone, and possible failure of \nthe implant. Because of the risk of morbidity from infections, \nantimicrobial therapy is an essential component of the surgi-\ncal protocol. A high microbial burden in a wound increases \nthe host’s inlammatory response to the area.\nBacteria release endotoxins and metalloproteases that \ndestroy the extracellular matrix of healing connective tissues \nand cause cell lysis. Bacterial infection and increased inlam-\nmation can lead to further tissue damage. Bacteria also com-\npromise wound healing by competing with the healing tissue \nfor nutrients and oxygen.53\nIt is prudent to address chronic or acute periodontal or \nendodontic infections prior to implant surgical procedures. \nProphylactic use of antimicrobials in the form of antibiotics \nand antimicrobial rinses has signiicant beneits for preven-\ntion of infections following implant surgical procedures."

Documented cases of potential consequences of \ninfection range from increased pain and edema to patient \nmortality. One of the main causes of dental implant failure \nmay be bacterial contamination at implant insertion.\nAntimicrobial Rinse\nAnother modality for antimicrobial prophylaxis for implant \nsurgery is the use of an oral rinse, (e.g., 0.12% or 0.2% \nchlorhexidine digluconate). Chlorhexidine gluconate is a \npotent antibacterial rinse that causes lysis by binding to bac-\nterial cell membranes. It has high substantivity, which permits \nit, at high concentrations, to exhibit bactericidal qualities by \ncausing bacterial cytoplasm precipitation and cell death.\nIn the oral cavity, chlorhexidine has been shown to have \nbiologic substantivity and slow release from tissue surfaces \nover a 12-hour period. In vitro studies have reported inhibi-\ntory effects of chlorhexidine on cultured epithelium and cell \ngrowth. Clinical studies have not supported the laboratory \nindings.\nIn contrast, chlorhexidine has been demonstrated to be an \neffective adjuvant in reducing bioilm, enhancing gingival \nhealth, improving soft tissue healing, treating periodontal \ndisease, preventing alveolar osteitis, improving tissue healing \nafter extractions, and reversing peri-implantitis, while \nshowing no adverse effects on implant surfaces. When evalu-\nating the effect of preoperative chlorhexidine before dental \nimplant surgery, a signiicant reduction in the number of \ninfectious complications (2 to 1) is realized and a sixfold \nreduction in implant failures in comparison to no use of \nchlorhexidine controls has been reported (Fig. 11.41).\nAseptic Technique\nTo prevent conditions likely to result in infection, a controlled, \nwell-monitored aseptic setting should be achieved for the \nsurgical procedure. The aseptic surgical site includes proper \ndisinfection and draping procedures of the patient, hand \nscrubbing, sterile gowns worn by all surgical members, and \nmaintenance of complete sterility of the instrumentation.\nDecreased Surgical Time\nAnother important surgical factor related to postoperative \ninfection is the duration of the surgical procedure. This factor \nhas been shown to be the second most critical risk factor \n(after wound contamination) affecting postoperative infec-\ntion rates.18 Surgical procedures lasting less than 1 hour have \nan infection rate of 1.3%; procedures in excess of 3 hours \nincrease the infection rate to more than 4%. It is postulated \nthat the rate of infection doubles with every hour of the \nprocedure.\nClinician Experience and Skill\nThe skill and the experience of the surgeon with the place-\nment of implants have been shown to be signiicant in post-\noperative infections and implant failures. A recent study has \nreported that less experienced surgeons (<50 implants placed) \nhave a 7.3% increase in failure rates in comparison to expe-\nrienced surgeons.\nDIET AND SUPPLEMENTS\nAside from routine postoperative instructions speciic to diet, \nthe use and potential beneits of supplements is a frequent \ntopic of inquiry from patients. Signiicant vitamin and trace \nmineral deiciencies are rarely seen in patients with acute \nwounds in whom healing is rapid and uncomplicated. \nHowever, in patients who have chronic disease and who may \nhave inadequate diets, vitamin deiciencies may play a signii-\ncant role in delaying wound healing. In general, if the nutri-\ntional status of a patient is in question, supplemental doses \nof several key vitamins should be recommended. These medi-\ncations are inexpensive and have a very low rate of morbidity \nif given in therapeutic doses.\nVitamin C\nVitamin C, oxygen, ketoglutarate, and iron are essential \ncofactors for the enzymes prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl \nhydroxylase, both of which are required for normal collagen \nmetabolism. Vitamin C is important in aerobic metabolism. \nFibroplasia is especially sensitive to vitamin C deiciency. This \nis dramatically demonstrated in patients who suffer from"

Additionally, Vitamin A reduces the \nrisk of wound infection as it is essential for proper immune \nsystem function and management of inlammation.\nVitamin B\nVitamin B complex consists of eight water-soluble vitamins \nfound in meat, dairy, vegetables, ish, and cereals. Vitamin B \ncomplex helps to promote cell proliferation and maintain \nhealthy skin and muscle tone, increase metabolic rate, and \nenhance immune and nervous system function. Deiciencies \nin vitamin B may impair wound healing, antibody formation, \nwhite blood cell function, and bacterial resistance. They are \nassociated with several disorders, many of which have skin \nmanifestations.\nThiamine\nThiamine is associated with decreased wound healing and \nbreaking strength. B-complex vitamins and cobalt are essen-\ntial cofactors for many enzyme systems.\nVitamin E\nVitamin E deiciency on wound healing has not been well \ndescribed. However, the use of Vitamin E has been shown to \nimprove wound tensile strength in patients whose wounds \nhad been exposed to ionizing radiation. Vitamin E may reduce \nthe peroxidation of lipids caused by radiation. In large doses, \nvitamin E may be detrimental to wound healing and should \nnot be given if the patient does not have a clear deiciency.55\nCopper\nCopper is needed for lysyl amine oxidase, and calcium is \nneeded as a cofactor for the normal function of granulocyte \ncollagenase and other collagenases.\nZinc\nZinc deiciency retards both ibroplasia and epithelialization. \nA common element in numerous enzymes found in the \nhuman body, zinc is needed for DNA replication and is a \ncoenzyme for DNA polymerase and reverse transcriptase. \nCells with a rapid cellular turnover rate are most severely \naffected by zinc deiciency.\nREDUCTION OF LOCAL FACTORS\nAdverse/destructive oral habits can contribute to wound \ndehiscence with or without an interim prosthesis. Patients \nwith parafunctional habits should be identiied during the \nearly phases of treatment planning. Occlusal overload, even \non a well-adjusted interim prosthesis, can transmit harmful \nforces to the underlying tissues.\nA cascade of complications may result, beginning with \nwound dehiscence, and lead to lack of integration or failure of \nhard and/or soft tissue augmentation procedures. The causes \nof parafunction or nonfunctional tooth contact have been \nclassiied into six categories: (1) local, (2) systemic, (3) psy-\nchologic, (4) occupational, (5) involuntary, and (6) volun-\ntary.56 Local factors include tooth form or occlusion, as well as \nsoft tissue changes such as ulcerations or pericoronitis.\nPsychologic causes occur with the greatest frequency and \nare associated with the release of emotional tension or anxiety. \nIncluded in this category are nail biting, cheek biting, and \nsucking habits. Occupational factors for professionals such as \nphysicians, dentists, athletes, and precision workers may lead \nto parafunction, as well as for the seamstress or musician who \ndevelop altered oral habits. The ifth cause of parafunctional \nforce is involuntary movement that provokes bracing of the \njaws, such as lifting of heavy objects or sudden stops while \ndriving. Examples of voluntary causes include chewing gum \nor pencils, bracing the telephone between the head and shoul-\nder, and pipe smoking.\nMANAGEMENT OF INCISION LINE OPENING\nIn the dental implant literature, there are two treatment \nrecommendations discussed with respect to incision line \nopening. The irst is to allow the surgical wound to heal via \nsecondary intention with the use of antimicrobials and \nhygiene measures (Box 11.4). The second treatment modality \nis to resuture the opened surgical wound, which is not recom-\nmended by the authors (Table 11.2).\nTo allow the site to heal by secondary intention, there \nneeds to be signiicant discipline and patient cooperation for \nBOX 11.4 Secondary Intention Protocol\nClinician\n1. Relieve prosthesis to have no buccal lange and no contact \non the surgical wound area.\n2. Maintain stress-bearing areas on the prosthesis with the \nuse of a tissue conditioner; however, material should be \nremoved from the dehisced area.\n3. Locally \nclean \nthe \ndehiscence \narea \nwith \n0.12% \nchlorhexidine.\n4. Closer observation of the patient to include recall appoint-\nments a minimum of once a week for the irst month.\nPatient Instructions\n1. Nonvigorous rinse with 0.12% chlorhexidine twice daily, \nplaque control.\n2. Minimize the use of interim prosthesis.\n3. No direct mastication on the area of dehiscence.\n4. Avoid smoking and the use of alcohol.\n5. Avoid peroxide and alcohol-based mouth rinses.\n6. Avoid acidic foods.\n7. Avoid inspection of dehiscent site (pulling on lip to see \narea).\n8. Do not use any denture adhesive with the interim \nprosthesis."

This may result in a larger dehiscence or infec-\ntion. If completed, the margins of the tissue should be “fresh-\nened” with a scalpel or a diamond bur. Greenstein has \nrecommended that, when the dehiscence is small and occurs \nwithin 24 to 48 hours, the clinician may immediately resuture \nthe dehiscence. Once the wound is large (2 to 3 cm) or the \ntime elapsed is more than 2 to 3 days, it becomes more dif-\nicult for the margins of the wound to be excised and resu-\ntured.57 It is the authors’ recommendation to be cautious with \nresuturing incision lines that may end up resulting in \nincreased morbidity of the surgical wound.\nAs stated earlier, there exist many variables when evaluat-\ning a wound dehiscence. Two of the most important factors \nare the type of surgical procedure that was completed and the \nlength of time since the dehiscence occurred. Therefore, a \nprocedure-speciic protocol has been established that is \ndependent on the timing of the dehiscence (early [within irst \n2 to 3 days] vs. late [≈4 weeks after surgery]) (Fig. 11.42).\nFIG 11.42 (A) Tissue removal bur that coincides with the implant diameter.

Implant \nsurgery, and especially bone grafting procedures, commonly \ncause a situation where hard tissue volumes will be larger \nthan the soft tissue that originally covered the site. This soft \ntissue must be manipulated to prevent incision line opening. \nManaging this phenomenon during surgery is a skill, and one \nthat requires great surgical fundamentals and practice.\nDespite our best efforts, incision line opening does occur \nfrom time to time. When a wound opens and implant/graft \ncontents become exposed to the oral environment, a situation \noccurs that demands extreme care in order to preserve the \nchances that the overall surgical outcome is a desirable one. \nThe contents of this chapter will help lay a groundwork for \nthe clinician to manage these situations in a way that will \nensure successful outcomes despite the complication.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Through the \ncombined efforts of a great number of clinicians and research-\ners, guidelines have been established in regards to proper \nimplant numbers and positioning based on possible pros-\nthetic designs. The patient’s existing bone volume often \nmakes the proper placement and positioning of implants dif-\nicult, if not impossible. Ideal treatment planning in implant \ndentistry often requires the correction of signiicant alveolar \nridge defects in regions where dental implants are indicated \nto support critical prostheses. Alveolar ridge defects are \ncaused by a variety of factors including developmental anom-\nalies, trauma, and most commonly, tooth extraction. Follow-\ning tooth loss, a predictable resorptive process of the alveolar \nbone occurs in both a horizontal and vertical dimension.1,2\nThe loss of alveolar bone can pose a challenge both from \nthe perspective of supporting a conventional removable pros-\nthesis or placement of dental implants in an ideal position \nfor functional and esthetic results. Prior to development of \neffective bone grafting techniques, implants were placed in \nregions where there was available bony support, often leaving \nthe restorative dentist with the task of restoring an implant \nin a less-than-ideal position within the arch. The success of \nimplant dentistry today has been largely related to the advent \nof bone augmentation techniques that allow regeneration of \nan ideal ridge form and placement of implants in their ideal \nfunctional and esthetic positions.3-7\nThe augmentation of bone volumes through grafting is a \nhighly technique-sensitive process. It requires meticulous \nsurgical skill, practice, and knowledge to become proicient \nin creating predictable bone growth prior to implant place-\nment. Complications are plentiful in this discipline, leading \nto treatment delays, patient and provider frustration, as well \nas possible neurosensory, vascular, and infectious issues. The \ndental implant surgeon must have a irm understanding of \nthe limitations of various bone grafting techniques to develop \nappropriate treatment plans. Clinicians must be able to not \nonly prevent complications during the procedure, but also \nproperly address these issues should they arise.\nTREATMENT PLANNING\nFailure to Understand Bone Resorption\nEtiology. Treatment planning implant-supported restora-\ntions in edentulous spaces requires a clear understanding of \nthe resorptive patterns of bone loss. As a ridge resorbs, avail-\nable bone for support of dental implants disappears, prevent-\ning placement of implants in key locations for restorative \nsuccess. After tooth loss, the initial pattern of bone resorption \nstarts with loss of the lateral (buccal) aspect of the ridge, \neventually leading to a decrease in vertical ridge height. As \nthis resorptive process occurs, the position of implant-\nsupported restorations can be changed substantially second-\nary to the new interarch relationship between the maxilla and \nthe mandible. For instance, the loss of maxillary posterior \nteeth with the accompanied loss of the buccal bony width will \noften lead to development of a posterior crossbite. This is \ncompounded as the mandible deteriorates into a division C \nor D ridge, resorbing until the remaining mandibular basal \nbone is actually positioned laterally, away from the remaining \nmaxillary bone (Fig. 12.1).\nThe treatment planning process must start with a reasonable \nassessment of the extent of the bony deiciency and the capac-\nity of a regenerative procedure to create adequate support for \nimplants in their ideal positions for comfort, aesthetics, func-\ntion, and support. As the extent of bone regeneration is evalu-\nated, care must be taken from the beginning stages to identify \nthe expected positions of each restoration or prosthesis using \naccurate restorative wax-ups. Evaluation of the relationship \nbetween the required restorative positions and the bony dei-\nciency will then provide insight into the volume and shape of \nthe bone that will need to be generated. At this stage, the most \npredictable surgical approach and bone graft material (e.g., \nautograft, allograft, xenograft) is selected to ensure adequate \nbone support can be developed for ideal implant placement.\nComplication. In site assessment treatment planning, compli-\ncations often result when the clinician fails to understand the \nrelationship between the limitations of various regenerative \ngrafting techniques and the predictable development of the \nrequired bone contours and bone volume needed for overall \nrestorative success. It is not possible to treat every defect with \nsimple or limited techniques because this discipline requires a \nvariety of approaches to meet the reality of advanced bone \nresorption. When the incorrect technique is utilized, inadequate \nbone volume will be regenerated, leading to either compro-\nmised restorative results or a potential failure of the prosthesis. \nThese problems not only compromise the local grafting site, but \nthey can also destroy bone around surrounding teeth, creating \na worse situation than was originally encountered."

Lateral resorption in the maxilla leaves the remaining bone in a more medial posi-\ntion than the lower arch. (D) The same sagittal view of a patient’s CBCT scan depicts the same \nresorption pattern that is seen in B. \nA\nB\nC\nD\nPrevention. In an ideal setting, prevention starts with total \nawareness of ridge preservation and limiting bone loss before \nmajor ridge defects occur. This starts with atraumatic extrac-\ntion techniques, aggressive socket grafting, and communica-\ntion with the whole implant team in respect to the need for \ntimely preservation of the ridge. The longer the patient \nremains without an implant in an extraction site, the greater \nthe chance that adjunctive grafting procedures will be neces-\nsary. For patients with long-term edentulism, the surgeon \nneeds to be fully aware of the mechanisms of bone resorption \nto understand the current underlying bony architecture and \nto correctly choose a grafting protocol that will build the \ncorrect volume for the intended prosthesis. A working knowl-\nedge of ridge resorption and expertise in the use of effective \ndiagnostic imaging to accurately assess bone volumes gives \nthe clinician the opportunity to correctly organize a reason-\nable and predictable implant treatment plan (Fig. 12.2).\nFailure to Understand the Need for Bone Grafting\nEtiology. Success in any implant prosthesis requires the \nimplants to be placed in positions that provide ideal aesthet-\nics, function, comfort, and support. To be successful in the \ndevelopment of a favorable prosthesis, the number and posi-\ntions for implants in an edentulous space must be determined \nwith a careful analysis of the relationship between the restor-\native prosthesis and the forces that will be exerted on the inal \nprosthesis. This is then associated with the functional and \nesthetic aspects of the case, ultimately dictating the relation-\nship between the implants, bone, and opposing forces. All of \nthese factors must be considered in planning support for a \nprosthesis that functions well while maintaining the bone \nvolume around its implant abutments. Clinicians too often \ntry to bypass the grafting process, either to save time or \nbecause they are not experienced in advanced grafting tech-\nniques. Insuficient bone in recipient sites leads to placement \nof implants with inadequate diameters, short lengths, or \nin insuficient numbers. Compromises like these eventually \nlead to signiicant damage around an implant and the pros-\nthesis it supports. Due to the fact that resorption occurs in \nevery edentulous site, the need for adjunctive bone grafting \nis very common and is often vital for a successful outcome \n(Fig. 12.3).\nComplication. Failure to recognize the need for bone graft-\ning leads to numerous treatment issues, ranging from esthetic \ncomplications to implant and prosthetic failure. Placing \nimplants of suboptimal sizes or in less than ideal numbers to \nbypass the grafting process is a compromise that often leads \nto force-related failures of implant components, the prosthe-\nses itself, or accompanied bone loss. Ultimately, prosthetic \nand implant morbidities may result.\nPrevention. A multidisciplinary approach should be taken \nto assess the optimal prosthetic solution for the patient, based"

Evaluation of the clinical situation, review of \ntwo-dimensional radiographs, assessment of models with \non the patient’s wishes, available bone, and other factors. \nWhen the prosthetic plan has been established, the clinician \nshould begin planning the implant positions required to \nexecute the prosthetic option. Once the sites for implants \nhave been determined, the associated sites are evaluated for \nfoundational support in the required positions.

    "content": "443\nCHAPTER 12 Bone Grafting Complications\nrestorative wax-ups, and information from cone beam com-\nputed tomography (CBCT) imaging all play a role in deter-\nmining where bone will be required and how much bone will \nbe needed to successfully graft the site. This is important \nwhen autogenous bone is incorporated into the regenerative \nprocess, and failure to clearly consider the dificulty of this \nbone harvest can lead to an eventual shortfall in the graft’s \nsuccess.\nComplications. In cases where the implant clinician fails to \nproperly develop adequate bone volumes for grafting and \nimplant positioning, relection of tissue over the grafted site \nwill reveal inadequate bony support for the intended implant \nsize and position. At this time, critical decisions must be \nmade to prevent the chance of compromising the overall case \nsuccess due to this shortfall. The best solution is to stop and \nregraft the site, but this causes inconvenience for the patient, \nembarrassment for the surgeon, and an overall increase in the \ntreatment time and expense. The alternative is to ignore the \ndeiciency, placing the implant in a deicient site that ulti-\nmately limits the implant size or forces improper placement \nof the implant in an alternative position. Successful restor-\native cases require discipline and cutting corners leads to \ndisappointed patients.\nPrevention. The use of CBCT imaging along with proper \ndiagnostic casts allow the clinician to implement a proper \nprosthetic plan. The restorative wax-up can easily be inter-\nlaced into the CT imaging software for assessment of the \nbone volumes needed for proper implant support in key \npositions. Once the dimensions and volume of the graft \nhave been determined, proper application of bone grafting \ntechniques and materials is necessary to ensure that the \nintended volume can be achieved. At this point, the patient \nshould be educated on the details of the regenerative proce-\ndures and a timeline of treatment. Advanced grafting proce-\ndures delay completion of the inal prosthesis, and patients \nshould be aware of the extent of the inconvenience that \nwill need to be tolerated during this surgical sequence. \nSites for autogenous grafts should also be evaluated to \nensure there is adequate donor bone available to produce \nthe bone foundation needed to execute the treatment plan \n(Figs. 12.4 and 12.5).\nFailure to Evaluate the Tissue Biotype in \nTreatment Planning\nEtiology. Patient-to-patient comparisons of the soft tissue \ndrape surrounding the natural teeth often demonstrate sig-\nniicant differences in color, surface consistency, tissue thick-\nness, and overall aesthetics. This is emphasized when a very \nthin and friable tissue drape surrounds an anterior tooth. \nDifferentiation of patients into either a “thick biotype” or a \n“thin biotype” is a critical tool that can be used during ante-\nrior implant–related treatment planning. Cook and Mealey \ndemonstrated the most simple way to determine tissue \nbiotype is through the visibility of a periodontal probe in the \nsulcus of an anterior tooth. A patient with a thick biotype \nwill not show any translucence of the probe through the \nsulcular tissue. In contrast, a thin biotype will allow visual-\nization of the coloration of a probe through the sulcular \ntissue. A patient with a thick biotype has tissue with a robust \npink, stippled appearance. This dense tissue drape forms a \nthick layer of tissue that is very forgiving when dental resto-\nrations are placed around natural teeth and when dental \nimplants are involved. The thin biotype patient, however, \npresents a much more dificult challenge. These patients \nhave a thinner labial plate thickness, a narrower keratinized \ntissue width, a greater distance from the CEJ to the initial \nalveolar crest, and there is visibility of a periodontal probe \nthrough the sulcus. As teeth migrate out of position or rotate \nin the arch, the prominence of the roots can increase, com-\nplicating the soft tissue situation even more. Thin layers of \ntissue around the maxillary anterior teeth require meticu-\nlous planning to hide underlying crown margins. In the case \nof implants, problems related to the translucence of the dark \nhue of the implant body and the abutment can signiicantly \ncomplicate the aesthetics surrounding the inal restoration \n(Fig. 12.6).58\nComplication. When there is no consideration of the biotype \nof a patient, esthetic complications can occur, especially in \nthe anterior regions. Thin biotype patients tend to be more \nprone to recession, and thin tissue may result in a bluish-gray \nhue at the gumline of the implant restored tooth. If recession \nor slight bone loss occurs, the facial aspect of the implant \ncan be exposed, leaving a similar dark hue to the overlying \ntissue and the patient with a poor esthetic and embarrassing \npresentation.\nPrevention. When a clinician is aware of tissue biotype, it is \npossible to plan ahead procedurally to maintain or possibly \nchange the biotype, leading to optimal esthetic outcomes. \nPatients with a very thin biotype can be evaluated for intra-\noperative supplementation using connective tissue grafts and \nfacial bone grafts to create a more forgiving tissue drape over \nthe implant site. As thicker cortical bone volumes promote \nthicker biotypes, the bony architecture and soft tissue drape \nmay be modiied in an esthetic zone prior to implant place-\nment and restoration. Advance planning also provides the \nimplant team an opportunity to inform the patient about \nthese issues and to point out potential esthetic complications \nprior to commencing treatment. A patient’s expectations \nmust be addressed, especially if they are not interested in \ngrafting to modify the tissue type (Fig. 12.7).\nTreatment. Correction of thin biotypes requires tissue aug-\nmentation to create a thick, dense layer of ibrous tissue over \nthe implant body and any deiciencies involving the adjacent \nnatural teeth. Connective grafting procedures are readily \navailable to increase the thickness of the tissue drape in situ-\nations like this. Subepithelial connective grafting procedures \nmay utilize either palatal connective tissue or acellular dermal \nmatrix (i.e., AlloDerm [BioHorizons IPH, Inc.]) as the source \nof donor tissue.

The ideal GBR membrane is a biocompat-\nible material capable of excluding epithelium without elicit-\ning an immune reaction that might interfere with bone \nregeneration. Membranes are typically classiied as resorbable \nor nonresorbable. Nonresorbable membranes include tita-\nnium foils, expanded polytetraluoroethylene (e-PTFE) and \ndense polytetraluoroethylene (d-PTFE) with or without tita-\nnium reinforcement. Studies of GBR procedures utilizing \ntitanium-reinforced nonresorbable membranes have shown \ngreat success with horizontal and vertical alveolar ridge \naugmentation because of their ability to maintain space, \nminimize graft mobility, and exclude epithelium.11-21 Disad-\nvantages of nonresorbable membranes include the need for \nreentry procedures for membrane removal and frequent \npostoperative infections that may follow premature mem-\nbrane exposure.20,22 Various studies have shown premature \nmembrane exposures typically result in increased morbidity \nand decreased bone regeneration in GBR procedures. Recent \nreports of d-PTFE use have demonstrated that membrane \nexposure does not always dictate failure of the developing \ngraft. If the d-PTFE membrane can be maintained for at least \n6 weeks, removal at that time or later will often be followed \nwith development of a reasonable bony ridge. This is different \nthan earlier cases, where e-PTFE membranes allowed bacte-\nrial invasion of the entire graft site through the larger pore \nsizes found in the e-PTFE membranes. The smaller pore size \nin the d-PTFE membrane prevents direct passage of bacteria \nthrough the membrane. Subsequently altered bone develop-\nment may tend to be limited to the surrounding margins \nwhere the membrane was exposed (Fig. 12.9).22,54\nResorbable. In order to overcome these limitations, resorb-\nable membranes have become a popular alternative because \nthey are biodegradable and are less likely to become infected \nin the event of an exposure.23-26 Resorbable membranes are \ntypically made of polyesters (e.g., polyglycolic acid [PGA], \npolylactic acid [PLA]) or tissue-derived collagens (e.g., Allo-\nDerm GBR, Ossix Plus). AlloDerm is an acellular dermal \nmatrix originally developed in 1994 to be used as a skin \nbone regeneration (GBR), onlay block grafting, ridge split-\nting, distraction osteogenesis, or a combination of these \ntechniques.5,6,8,9 GBR with autogenous bone, bone harvested \nfrom the same individual, is considered by some to be the \ngold standard for alveolar ridge augmentation.10 The use of \nallografts requires timely substitution of these primarily \nosteoconductive particles with vital bone, and the consistency \nof the resulting ridge must be dense enough to withstand the \nforces generated during the preparation of the osteotomy and \ninsertion of the implant. Incorporation of osteoinductive \ngraft materials into the procedure promotes the development \nof strong bony ridges, and the overall substitution process \ncan be shortened. Autogenous bone provides the most active \nosteoinductive properties, as does the use of bone morpho-\ngenic protein (BMP) and other growth factors.55\nComplications. A clinician who is not well versed in the \nlimitations of the variety of graft materials may fall into the \ntrap of a “one size its all” approach to treatment. When sig-\nniicant defects require large volumes of bone, autogenous \ngrafting may also be necessary. Allograft procedures are \noften used to spare the patient potential discomfort related \nto a secondary donor site. However, allograft in some cases \nwill not develop a suficient volume of bone to allow ideal \nimplant placement and an aesthetic restoration. Complica-\ntions usually arise when a graft is placed using a technique or \nwith materials unsuited for the demands of the bone defect. \nPoor results eventually lead to increased treatment times, a \nloss of patient conidence in the surgeon and increased treat-\nment costs.\nPrevention. The prevention of potential graft failures and \npoor augmentation volumes starts with a clear understanding \nof the anatomical, restorative, and aesthetic requirements for \nthis speciic defect. These factors must be matched to the best \nutilization of available grafting materials, membrane choices, \ntechniques for space maintenance, and site protection.

In the dental literature, AlloDerm has been \nsuccessfully used for root coverage, thickening of soft tissues, \nand guided bone regeneration.24,28-30 AlloDerm GBR is a \nthinner version (thickness ranges from 0.5–0.9 mm) of \nthe original AlloDerm product (thickness ranges from 0.9– \n1.6 mm), speciically designed for GBR.

The tenting screws are \ntypically used as “tent poles” to support the membrane, \ndecrease graft mobility, and relieve external pressure on the \ngraft55 (Fig. 12.10).\nTypes of Bone Grafting Material\nAutogenous Bone. Autogenous bone is still considered \nby many to be the gold standard graft material for GBR \nbecause of its osteogenic, osteoinductive, and osteoconduc-\ntive properties.6,10,39Autogenous bone is commonly harvested \nintraorally from the ramus and symphysis, but is associated \nwith increased morbidity related to a second surgical site, \nunpredictable graft resorption, and graft mobility.5,10,13,40-44 \nThe anatomy of the posterior edentulous ridge can limit the \nshape and volume of donor bone available for harvesting \nautogenous blocks.44 Many times the autogenous block and \nrecipient site require such extensive preparation in order to \nobtain intimate contact between the graft and recipient site \nthat a large percentage of the harvested bone cannot be \nutilized.43 Some clinicians have advocated crushing the autog-\nenous block graft into a particulate autogenous graft to allow \nfor more conservative recipient site preparation, complete \nutilization of the harvested bone, and a decreased volume of \nbone that will need to be harvested, thereby decreasing the \nmorbidity of the procedure (Fig. 12.11).17,45\nAllografts. In order to overcome the limitations related to \nthe availability of autogenous bone volume, various bone \nsubstitutes, including xenografts (material harvested from \nanother species), alloplasts (inert synthetic material), and \nallografts (material harvested from another individual of the \nsame species), are being used as adjuncts for GBR with suc-\ncessful clinical and histologic outcomes.6,8,13 Some clinicians \nhave advocated combining autogenous bone with the various \nbone substitutes.16,23,45,46 The potential beneits of adding par-\nticulate autogenous bone to an allograft are the addition of \nosteogenic and osteoinductive growth factors to the osteo-\nconductive properties of a bone substitute. The use of this \ncombination allows for a reduction in the amount of autog-\nenous bone harvested, decreasing the morbidity and postop-\nerative discomfort for the patient.\nXenografts. Xenografts are graft materials that are taken \nfrom a donor of one species and grafted into a recipient of \nanother species. This type of graft material heals via osteo-\nconduction. Simian et al found that the addition of deprot-\neinized bovine bone mineral (Bio-Oss) to autogenous \nparticulate resulted in greater vertical augmentation than \nparticulate autogenous material alone. Urban has combined \nbovine particles with autogenous bone in the development of \nlarge volumes of vertical and horizontal bone in severely \ncompromised regeneration sites. The incorporation of the \nbovine product is planned for extended support of the graft \nvolume, following with a timely turnover into vital bone as \nthe graft matures (Fig. 12.12).16,47"

The literature today provides a multitude of surgi-\ncal approaches that are available for regeneration of deicient \nimplant sites. These would typically include particulate grafts, \nBMP graft combinations, block grafts, and the use of ridge-\nsplitting techniques. The implant team must carefully con-\nsider each clinical situation to determine which technique \nwill most predictably develop the needed bony support for \nthe restorative treatment plan. In this assessment, the anatomy \nof the defect will often lead to the choice of a particular \napproach due to the ease of graft placement or the limitations \nof using a rigid graft in a highly irregular recipient site. \nRecipient sites with a very irregular surface are preferably \napproached with a particulate approach, and cortical blocks \nare best utilized where a smooth bed can be prepared for close \nadaptation of the block to the underlying defect.\nThe depth of the vestibule is a signiicant factor when \nevaluating defects. The use of an autogenous block is much \neasier when the vestibule is very deep and there is adequate \nroom for adaptation of the entire length of the cortical graft. \nPlacement of a block in a shallow defect can sometimes be \ndificult because of anatomic limits that will force graft place-\nment higher above the ridge than the bone on the adjacent \nAlloplasts. The use of alloplasts is not currently recom-\nmended for major ridge augmentation.

This same spacial support and protection prevents the \ngraft particles from slipping laterally during the healing \nprocess (Fig. 12.14).\nThe use of a “ridge splitting” approach should only be \nconsidered when the apical region of the site is thick enough \nto allow expansion of the cortical wall laterally without frac-\nturing the expanded cortical plate at the most inferior point \nof the split.

The coronal incision is usually placed on the \ncrest of the ridge, favoring a location closer to the palatal \naspect if possible. In regions where the keratinized tissue is \nlimited, the incision should at least “split” the distance \nbetween the two edges of the keratinized tissue. It is always \nbest to try to keep incision lines away from areas that are key \nto regenerative volume and protection. When possible, the \npapillae should be preserved. If there is a good papilla present, \nthe incision should be designed to avoid involvement of the \npapilla or it should be moved to the adjacent interproximal \nspace. If the papilla is absent or is lat, the incision can be \ndirectly adjacent to the root approximating the graft or it can \nbe moved to the adjacent space. Moving the releasing incision \nto the adjacent interproximal space also moves the incision \nline away from the grafting site, limiting complications if the \nwound opens up postoperatively. Extending to the adjacent \ninterproximal space can sometimes lead to dificulty in \nadvancement of a tension free lap over the graft site, but this \ncan be released with additional steps.\nThe releasing incision should always be prepared with a \nwider base than its coronal width to preserve the apical \nblood supply to the lap. As the lap is relected, it is critical \nthat the complete periosteal layer be relected with the lap, \navoiding maceration of the tissue during the releasing process. \nAttention to the thickness of the lap and careful use of \nthe scalpel and instruments is important at this stage. By \nkeeping instruments irmly against bone during the lap-\nreleasing process, the clinician ensures a proper full-thickness \nlap release.\nIncision lines should be prepared with vertical releasing \nincisions that are several millimeters away from the lateral \nborder of the graft site. When an incision line opens around \na graft site, the open region can directly contaminate the \nunderlying graft particles, preventing proper regeneration of \nthe bony defect. By moving the incision away from the critical \nregeneration site, the possibility of this type of contamination \ncan be limited to some degree (Figs. 12.19 to 12.22).\nTorn Lingual Flap\nEtiology. The tissue thickness on the lingual aspect of the \nmandible is very thin and friable. This tissue can be easily \ntorn during relection of the lap and manipulation of the \ntissue during the grafting procedures. Resultant “buttonhole” \nopenings may compromise the blood supply to the surround-\ning tissue that is needed for coverage over the graft site, \nleading to compromised results postoperatively.\nComplication. Tearing or buttonholing the lingual lap leads \nto exposure of the graft site and the possibility of margin \nnecrosis coronal to the tear. This exposure may lead to total \ngraft failure (Fig. 12.23).\nTreatment. If the lingual lap is torn during the procedure \nit can sometimes be repaired using 5-0 chromic suture, \nincision lines away from critical regions where graft particles \nor blocks could become exposed. Observation of sound sur-\ngical principles in preparation of incisions is critical for \nmaintenance of the blood supply to all of the involved tissues. \nWide-based incisions are always important to prevent inter-\nruptions in the vascular supply to the lap.\nComplication. Failure to properly plan the incision design \nof a lap during grafting can pose numerous issues, chiely \nrelated to incision line opening postoperatively. Incision line \nopening exposes the regeneration site to an inlux of oral \npathogens, soft tissue ingrowth, and loss of the graft materials \nthat were intended to be isolated during the maturation \nprocess. Failure to preserve the integrity of the papilla during \nincision line design eventually leads to compromised aesthet-\nics around the inal restoration. An initial incision without a \nconsistent depth may create a split-thickness lap, leading to \ntissue shredding and the involvement of vital structures \nlocated within the lap. Incisions through zones with limited \nkeratinized support can leave large expanses of mucosa along \nthe incision line. Thin mucosa is very dificult to predictably \nsuture to the adjacent lap, often leading to an open incision \ndays later. Lastly, failure to make broad-based releasing"

It is recommended to use a collagen mem-\nbrane below these fenestrations to assist with healing and to \nisolate the graft materials. Maintenance of the blood supply \nto the tissue lap is important; thus tension should be mini-\nmized to the lap.\nPrevention. Preparation of the initial incision line must be \nextended completely through the tissue and through the peri-\nosteum. At the time of the initial separation of the lap margin \nfrom the bone, care must be taken to obtain a clean release \nof the complete lap margin from the bone. Shredding the \nlap margin at this time leads to poor control during the rest \nof the lap release and ultimately to increased chances of \ntearing the partial-thickness lap. Curettes or retractors must \nbe utilized to create an even release and relection of the full \nlap throughout this process.\nDificulty Releasing the Flap for  \nTension-Free Closure\nEtiology. Successful augmentation procedures require main-\ntenance of an intact tissue closure along the incision line \nduring the healing process. One of the most common surgical \ncomplications that a clinician will experience early in their \nlearning curve is incision line opening. The failure of main-\ntaining this union is directly related to an inadequate release \nof all tension on the tissue lap as it is stretched over the \nwidened graft space. Clinicians will ind that it is impossible \nto pull a tissue lap over any sizeable graft site without irst \naltering the integrity of the lap itself. Examination of the \nexposed inner surface of a relected lap reveals a smooth \nshiny layer called the periosteum. The periosteum is com-\nprised of a thin irm layer of dense tissue that has no elastic \nibers. This binding layer limits any signiicant elongation of \nthe lap as it is stretched over a graft site. A simple incision \nthrough this dense tissue “releases” this tight band of pressure \non the underlying tissue lap. The tissue directly below the \nperiosteum is primarily comprised of elastic-type ibers, and \nonce the periosteum has been released, the entire lap can be \nstretched. This simple releasing incision ultimately allows \ntension-free closure over the graft site.\nComplication. A lap covering a graft that does not have \ncomplete release of pressure on the two margins of the lap \nwill often pull open during the healing process (incision line \nopening). Tension on the lap compromises the blood supply \nto the tissue along the suture line that is under pressure. This \npressure leads to necrosis and eventual separation of the two \nedges of the lap closure. Once this has occurred, the lap \ncannot be sutured back into place and the graft site is open \nfor contamination and tissue ingrowth. The success of bone \ngrafting is largely dependent on the maintenance of space for \nbone development and isolation of the graft particles during \nthe slow process of osteogenesis.

This space must be isolated from \noutside cellular downgrowth, and the lap covering the \ndeined space must be completely supported throughout the \nregenerative process. Each technique has its own advantages \nin relation to deining the inal shape of the ridge, and each \napproach has its own issues in respect to maintaining a sealed \nlayer over the graft site while the bone is developed. All of \nthese graft techniques require 5 to 6 months for maturation \nof the graft site. Over this timeframe various situations con-\ntribute to pressure on the graft site and breakdown of the \nincision lines and membrane edges.\nDeicient ridges occur when one or more of these princi-\nples is violated. Any mobility of the membrane will disrupt \nthe cellular development process, beginning with interrup-\ntion of the initial clot stability. Graft particles that are not \nconined or protected will tend to shift to a region that has \nless pressure or movement. The coronal aspects of all graft \nsites are very important because the bone around the plat-\nform of an implant carries a great deal of the occlusal load. \nFailure to deine and maintain this dimension leads to a \nnarrow width at the coronal aspect. A deicient ridge width \nlike this will many times create a dehiscence on the facial or \nlingual aspect of an implant. This bony deicit subjects the \nremaining bone to additional stress and also disrupts the \ndelicate soft tissue attachment around the abutment. Success \nin all of these approaches requires development of large \nvolumes of bone, overbuilding regions where possible. Under-\nestimation of the required bony support often leads to thin \nfacial bony coverage over an implant body. It is our experi-\nence that you really never have too much bone. All bone will \ngo through a constant remodeling process and all too often, \nfacial bone will thin over time.

The ield of advanced implant dentistry went \nthrough a complete paradigm shift when the irst augmenta-\ntion procedures were introduced. Until that time, implants \nwere placed in the islands of bone that were discovered at the \ntime of lap relection. This limited preoperative treatment \nplanning to a great extent and subsequently the role of the \nrestorative dentist was at many times very dificult. Implants \noften emerged at odd angles creating a variety of long-term \nsupport and restorative issues. The majority of bone grafts \ninitially were designed around block grafting techniques \nwhere signiicant volumes of bone were regenerated horizon-\ntally and in limited cases in a vertical dimension. Block graft-\ning is still used by many surgeons, but these procedures \nrequire surgical expertise and the morbidity can sometimes \nbe an issue from the patient’s standpoint.\nParticulate grafting was initially introduced utilizing non-\nresorbable e-PTFE membranes. This approach used titanium \nstruts to prevent collapse of the membrane into the critical \nregenerative space. The titanium could be trimmed and shaped \ninto contours that produced the bony support required for \nthe predetermined restorative plans. Nonresorbable mem-\nbranes were used to some extent, but they were generally \nlimited to production of 1–3 mm of bone thickness. These \nlimitations were directly related to the limited number of \nways that the space between the recipient bone and the sus-\npended membrane could be supported. In most cases, one \nor two bone ixation screws were placed in strategic sites, \nmaintaining enough space for smaller graft sites.\nIn recent years, alternative approaches have centered \naround expanded use of membrane/ixation screw tech-\nniques, introduction of nonresorbable d-PTFE membranes \nwith titanium struts, titanium mesh, temperature molded \nand welded membranes, along with other similar approaches. \nFIG 12.23 Lingual lap exposure.

Each one of these seemingly small issues can com-\npromise the whole regenerative process.\nComplication. Areas where a particulate graft shifts or where \na supporting membrane collapses typically heal in a manner \nthat does not provide the expected ridge shape and dimen-\nsion established during the restorative planning process. The \nclinician is forced to either compromise the implant position \nor abort the implant aspect of the procedure. This delays \nimplant placement until adequate supporting bone can be \ndeveloped with additional grafting. Implants that are placed \nin compromised recipient sites are prone to complications \nwhen the prosthesis is loaded and bone remodeling occurs.\nPrevention. GBR techniques utilize an occlusive barrier \nmembrane between the alveolar bone and the gingival \nepithelium/connective tissue to prevent epithelial down-\ngrowth into the alveolar ridge defect. The occlusive barrier \nmembrane allows for osteogenic cells from the adjacent alveo-\nlar bone to colonize the blood clot and to induce bone regen-\neration.31,47 Aside from soft tissue exclusion and clot stability, \nspace maintenance is the key to the success of GBR. Screw-\nsupported barrier membranes may be utilized for develop-\nment and maintenance of this regenerative space. This same \nvertical support can be achieved using titanium-supported \nmembranes, titanium mesh, or any other approach that creates \nand holds an open, isolated space for bone to occupy."

Exposed sites can still present problems \nrelated to invasion around the edges of the exposed mem-\nbranes. It has been described that d-PTFE membrane expo-\nsure cases need to be maintained for at least 6 weeks before \nthe membrane can be safely removed. Removal of the mem-\nbranes earlier than this exposes the contents to bacterial \ningrowth and this usually results in a signiicantly altered inal \ngraft result.

It is used with either a particulate graft or \nwith BMP that has been mixed with a graft and sponge \nmixture. If the integrity of the soft tissue lap can be main-\ntained throughout the healing process, signiicant bone \nvolumes have been consistently reproduced. If the lap margin \nor other region of the overlying lap exposes the titanium \nmesh, the predictability of the inal graft volume can be \ncompromised.\nTreatment. Treatment for dealing with an inadequate ridge \nfollows one of two approaches. The irst option involves \nplacement of implants in the compromised bony foundation, \ngrafting additional bone over the exposed implant threads at \nthe time of implant placement. This technique often leads to \nvaried results. If the exposure of the implant body is within \nthe contours of the surrounding basal bone, grafting will be \nmuch more predictable than in cases where the implant \ncontour extends beyond the surrounding basal bone. The \npresence of a blood supply, supporting bony protection, and \nadequate coverage of the remaining surfaces of the implant \nare critical. The second option requires postponement of the \nimplant insertions, attempting additional augmentation, and \nplacement of the implants after adequate bone has been \nregenerated. This approach is the most predictable for a suc-\ncessful long-term result. (Figs. 12.27 to 12.32).\nPARTICULATE GRAFTS\nExposure of the Bone Fixation Screw During  \nthe Healing Process\nEtiology. Bone ixation screws in regeneration sites some-\ntimes become exposed during the healing process, potentially \nleading to bacterial invasion around the neck of the screw. \nCareful attention to the timelines of the screw exposure \nand the type of regenerative process is important in these \nsituations.\n• Block Grafts. Exposures involving a ixation screw in a \nblock graft case do not allow many options related to \nscrew removal. The most important concept in block \ngrafting is rigid ixation of the block itself throughout \nthe regenerative process. Therefore, removal of the \nexposed screw could result in a total graft failure. These \nsituations must be maintained as well as possible with \nmaintenance of the exposed screw. \n• Particulate Grafts. Exposure of ixation screws in par-\nticulate grafting occurs when the head of the screw \nworks its way through the overlying membrane and \neventually perforates through the thin layer of the \nmucosa that covers the graft site. This typically happens \nwhen the screw head has a thin diameter that perforates \nthrough the membrane and eventually through the \ntissue. Particulate grafting techniques use these ixation \nscrews to support the membrane and to deine the \nshape of the desired bony contours. The use of a screw \nwith a “wide head” is found to be important for \nFIG 12.27 Bone screws for ridge contour. (A) Bone ixation \nscrews are used to deine the topography of the prescribed \nbony ridge prior to placement of the bone graft materials. \n(B) The mature graft postoperatively has grown up to the \nlevel of the heads of the ixation screws. This demonstrates \nthe principle of “space maintenance,” and the ability of the \nbody to ill in isolated spaces as long as the graft is supported \nand tissue ingrowth is prevented during the healing process. \nA\nB\npredictable results. The type of membrane used for \ngraft isolation also makes a signiicant difference when \nperforation of the screw through the membrane is a \nconcern. AlloDerm GBR tends to be very resistant to \nmembrane perforation during the healing process, \nwhereas collagen membranes are soft when moistened \nand tend to perforate and tear if strain is placed on the \nhydrated membrane.\nComplication. Perforation of a membrane allows the ingress \nof foreign matter and ibrous soft tissue cells into the graft \nsite, causing a disruption in the bone regeneration process. If \nthe head of the screw pushes through the soft tissue and is \nexposed, bacterial contamination may result, potentially \nleading to graft infection and possible failure.\nPrevention.

GBR techniques routinely require placement of \nocclusive membranes in the proximity of natural teeth. This \nrequires the implant surgeon to clearly understand the \nprinciples related to the positioning of nonresorbable mem-\nbranes and resorbable membranes in relation to natural root \nsurfaces.\n• Nonresorbable Membranes. Membranes used in early \nGBR were nonresorbable e-PTFE membranes, and \nthese were typically trimmed to allow 2 mm of space \nbetween the GBR membrane and the root of the adja-\ncent natural tooth. This allows soft tissue attachment \naround the biological width of the tooth and anchorage \nof tissue around the occlusive barrier. The use of \nd-PTFE today requires observation of these same rules \nof maintenance of 2 mm between the edge of the mem-\nbrane and the side of an adjacent root surface. GBR \ntechniques using titanium mesh requires 2 mm of \nclearance from the root of a tooth due to similar issues.\n• Resorbable Membranes. In GBR techniques utilizing \nresorbable membranes, the 2 mm rule is not a criti-\ncal factor and resorbable membranes can be placed \ndirectly against the roots of the adjacent teeth without \ncausing a membrane failure. Titanium mesh itself is \nseparated from the root of a tooth due to similar issues \n(Fig. 12.34).\nComplication. Placing resorbable membranes too close to the \nadjacent tooth roots can allow direct contamination of the \nmembrane through the interproximal space, contributing to \ntissue ingrowth and bacterial infection of the graft. Titanium \nstruts that are positioned close to the interproximal root sur-\nfaces will often lead to membrane exposure and a compro-\nmised graft volume in the region. The only complication with \nplacing resorbable membranes directly against natural roots is \nrelated to primary wound closure in the root proximity. Mem-\nbranes must be smooth and they should allow the overlying \nlap to be adapted evenly around the neck of a tooth root.\nPrevention\nNonresorbable membranes. Nonresorbable membranes \nshould be placed 2 mm from roots of adjacent teeth if pos-\nsible. Titanium supported membranes should be selected in \na form that does not have lateral struts that will be positioned \nin the proximity of a tooth root. Newer membranes are now \nbeing designed in arrangements that allow support over the \ninterproximal ridge without the need for lateral struts in \nthese critical interproximal regions.\nResorbable membranes. Resorbable membranes are not \nrequired to be separated from the adjacent roots in most cases. \nAcellular dermal matrix does not appear to need to be separated \nfrom root surfaces, keeping in mind that this same membrane \nis used in routine periodontal procedures for root coverage.\nFIG 12.31 Facial and palatal augmentation.

The symphysis provides the potential for \nharvesting thicker sections of bone when compared to the \nramus, where the average amount of donor bone does not \nexceed 3 to 4 mm in thickness. Normal variations in the \ncross-sectional anatomy of the symphyseal region in multiple \npatients require careful preoperative assessment of the region \nbefore surgical intervention is initiated. Prior to CBCT \nimaging, clinicians were generally forced to use lateral cepha-\nlograms or early cross-sectional imaging to predict the thick-\nness of bone in these regions. Today, CBCT cross sections \nprovide a precise measurement of the thickness of the donor \nsite, and any anomalies can be identiied preoperatively.\nPrevention. Spherical CT imaging or CBCT imaging is the \nrecommended approach for assessment of the anatomy and \nthickness of bone in the region of the symphysis or ramus. It \nis recommended to measure the actual distance from the \nfacial cortical plate to the lingual plate to irst make sure that \nthis will provide enough bone for the required recipient site \nand secondarily to provide a guide to the surgeon for the \ndepth of the preparation cuts into the cortical bone during \nthe harvest. If cross-sectional imaging is not available, use of \na lateral cephalogram or a 2-D occlusal ilm can provide some \nbasic idea of the anatomy of the region.\nCross-sectional imaging allows a realistic assessment of a \npotential donor site, and measurements on the 3-D image can \nbe prepared before surgery is commenced. Assessment of the \nthickness of the cortical bone must be considered, and cases \nwithout any medullary bone need to be identiied. The lack \nof suficient medullary space may prevent separation of the \nfacial and lingual cortical plates during the graft harvest and \nthe potential for sectioning completely through the lingual \nplate increases as blind harvesting is attempted.\nComplication. Complications may arise when inadequate \ndonor bone is present. This may result in inadequate graft \nvolume/thickness, poor density of the graft, and increased \ndonor site morbidity. Life-threatening situations have been \ndocumented when fractures have occurred, leading to the \nlingual mandibular symphysis being displaced into the sub-\nlingual space, ultimately interfering with the airway. When \nthe preparation of a block graft harvest extends through both \nthe facial and lingual cortical plates, the block is free to be \ndrawn to the lingual aspect as pressure on the block is applied \nby muscle attachments. The region of bone around the genial \ntubercle is directly attached to the genioglossus and geniohy-\noid muscle attachments. If the graft is no longer attached to \nthe surrounding mandibular bone, it will be drawn com-\npletely through the mandible and into the space below the \ntongue (Figs. 12.37 to 12.39).\nBleeding/Neurosensory Complications\nComplication. When a cortical graft and the surrounding \nmedullary bone are harvested in the symphyseal region, the \nunderlying neurovascular components are often compro-\nmised. These disruptions to the nerves and blood vessels may \ncontributing to a graft failure. The severity of this failure can \nvary depending on the duration of the infection and the onset \nof the contamination.\nPrevention. The use of proper surgical technique is vital in \nthe preventing surgical contamination. Preoperative antibi-\notic regimens, chlorhexidine scrubs, and aseptic technique \nwill limit bacterial contamination at the time of surgery. The \nintroduction of antibiotics into the graft medium may also \nbe included to minimize bacterial invasion. Proper suture \ntechnique and lap design are grafting fundamentals that \nprevent incision line opening that can also expose the graft \nto the oral microlora. Lastly, the clinician should ensure that \nall space maintenance components (nonresorbable mem-\nbranes, titanium mesh, tenting screws) are free from sharp \nedges that may perforate the mucosa postoperatively, allow-\ning the ingress of bacteria into the graft.\nTreatment. Postoperative examinations must be routinely \nscheduled, especially during the initial stages of wound \nhealing. The patient must be instructed in hygiene techniques \nthat minimize strain on the incision line, and postoperative \nchlorhexidine rinses can be used to manage the bacterial \nmicrolora. If incision line opening occurs, the patient must \nbe placed on a chlorhexidine rinsing protocol to keep the \ngraft site clean until the granulation is complete. If the patient \nexperiences purulence from the site or general malaise, anti-\nbiotic protocols must be commenced immediately. Non-\nresorbable membranes can be maintained for an initial 6 \nweek timeframe unless the site becomes infected. If this \noccurs, the membrane should be removed before the situa-\ntion advances (Fig. 12.36).\nBLOCK GRAFTS: SYMPHYSIS BONE GRAFTS\nInadequate Symphysis Bone Volume for a Graft\nEtiology.

The lingual artery is \napproximately 1 to 2 mm in diameter, and cross-sectional \nviews clearly show its anastomosis with the incisive canal at \nthis point.\nThe preparation of a grafting osteotomy in the midline \ncan potentially resect these blood vessels if they fall in the \npath of the vertical preparation. If this occurs, the sectioned \nextension of the lingual artery can prolapse back into the \nloor of the mouth. The severed vessel may release arterial \nblood low in the sublingual space, potentially raising the \ntongue to a point that compromises the airway.

Substantial bleeding reported \nin the symphysis during lap relection may be attributable to \nthese larger vessels.26 These bleeding points have previously \nbeen described as “nutrient canals,” indicating that they had \nno sensory component. Injury to these vessels can be avoided \nby limiting the apical extension of laps during grafting and \nrelated procedures close to the symphysis.\nIncorrect Size and Shape of Block Graft\nEtiology. The recipient surface anatomy of a bony defect is \ntypically irregular in its size and shape, which presents the \nclinician with a challenge as it pertains to grafting. In areas \nwhere block grafts are necessary to build appropriate bone \nvolume, the clinician must make a choice whether to modify \nbe accompanied by varied neurologic sensations along with \npossible signiicant bleeding immediately following the graft \nharvest.\nEtiology/Prevention\nThe incisive canal. The space between the mental foram-\nina has been known for years to be a safe zone for bone \nharvesting because of the lack of vital structures that can be \naffected by grafts taken from this region.

The use of dense cortical bone in ridge augmenta-\ntions has always presented a problem when an irregularly \nsurfaced cortical graft needs to be trimmed and reshaped for \nadaptation in a graft site. In the case of particulate grafting, \nthe complete piece of cortical bone must be broken into small \npieces before it can be used. Control of the graft particles \nduring this process is critical because loose particles can be \neasily lost or contaminated as the graft is processed. Autog-\nenous bone harvests are challenging, and loss of critical bone \nparticles and blocks can cause unnecessary time delays and \npatient discomfort if additional bone needs to be harvested \nto replace a contaminated block.\nComplication. Pieces of harvested bone can be lost if they \nare not contained during the preparation of the cortical \ngrafts.

(C) Keep the block under the \nwater level to prevent loss of particles during this process. \nA\nB\nC\nPrevention/Treatment. The particulate grafting technique \ndescribed in this chapter requires that a piece of a cortical \nblock be completely broken up into small particles that are \nthen packed into irregular bony defects. These small particles \ntend to “shoot out” of the ronguers if they are not carefully \ncontained. The best way to eliminate the loss of these cortical \nparticles is to ill a clear, shallow glass beaker or bowl with \nsaline. The block is then submerged in the saline and double-\naction ronguers are used to break it up into the particle size \nneeded for the procedure. The saline slows escaping particles \nin the same manner that water slows the movement of a \nbullet that is ired into water (Fig. 12.44).\nUltrasonic Piezosurgery–Related Tissue Injury\nEtiology. The use of ultrasound technology in dentistry irst \nbegan in the 1950s, and in the last 20 years piezosurgery units \nhave been developed using low-frequency ultrasound (10–60 \nkHz) for the selective cutting of bone. Traditional bone drill-\ning with motorized drills is easily available to clinicians; \nhowever, cutting bone with a drill can generate excessive \namounts of heat in dense bone, potentially damaging the \nsurrounding tissue. A surgical drill that comes in contact with \nblood vessels, nerves, or sinus membranes can also cut or \ndamage adjacent vital structures. The use of piezosurgery in \nimplant surgery has been a welcome alternative to motorized \ndrills in many applications. At the lower ultrasonic frequen-\ncies used for piezosurgery, surgical inserts cut through hard, \nmineralized bone but do not damage the surrounding \nsoft tissue or generate high amounts of heat. Piezosurgery \nhas been especially useful in implant surgery, where bone \nmust be cut in close proximity to a nerve or blood vessel. Use \nof the piezosurgery inserts generally allows the clinician \nto perform these bone alterations without damaging or \ncutting delicate tissues that come in direct contact with the \nultrasonic insert.\nComplication. As piezosurgery has been utilized over many \nyears, it has been reported by practitioners that the inserts \nshould not be allowed to function while in direct contact with \nthe soft tissue lap. Earlier surgical units were reported to \n“heat up the insert tip” during use, and irritations or burns \non the soft tissue lap were sometimes detected.\nPrevention. This altered tissue issue has not been evident in \nupdated piezosurgery units, but careful attention must be \ndirected to protection of surrounding soft tissue during ultra-\nsonic insert use. Instructors describe this as an abrasive phe-\nnomenon caused by the rapid ultrasonic movement of the tip \nagainst the soft tissue. Care must be taken to keep the tissue \nlap away from the ultrasonic inserts.\nTreatment. Development of any abrasive or burn-type \nlesion should be treated symptomatically, just as any \nother oral burn or abrasive lesion would be treated. If \nthere are any signs of more serious damage, more involved \ntreatment may require appropriate referrals for wound care \n(Figs. 12.45 and 12.46).\nChin Graft Closure Complications\nEtiology. The closure of a chin graft donor site is a very \ndelicate process, with periodic incidences of incision line \nopening postoperatively. The chin presents a unique situa-\ntion because tension from the surrounding musculature \nplaces constant pressure on the healing wound in a chin \ngraft donor site.

Because the second terminal branch of the inferior \nalveolar nerve (incisive branch) terminates in the anterior \nmandibular area, it is not uncommon to sever this section of \nthe nerve during osteotomy preparation. However, because \nthe incisive nerve is only a sensory nerve to the incisor teeth, \nthis usually results in only a “dullness” in sensation. Hop-\npenreijs et al showed a negative pulpal response in 16% of \npatients with total resolution in 6 to 12 months.49,50\nPrevention. The superior portion of the harvest site \nshould be prepared at least 5 mm below the level of the \nincisor root tips. Care must be taken to avoid the longer \nroots of the cuspids as each end of the harvest pattern is \nprepared. Aggressive harvesting of the medullary portion of \nthe symphysis should be minimized in the superior aspects \nif possible to limit damage to neural pathways through the \nregion. Most importantly, complete patient education must \nbe conducted “prior to” the surgery informing the patient \nabout potential sensory changes that could occur. The \npatient should be aware that they could feel a dullness \nor “woody” feeling of the mandibular anterior teeth follow-\ning surgery. This can be temporary or a permanent condi-\ntion, but it has never been described as a particularly \nannoying feeling. Very rarely is there an indication for end-\nodontic therapy, as the vitality of the teeth returns to \nnormal (Fig. 12.48).\nImproper Superior Margin Location:  \nSymphyseal Graft\nComplication.

One of the main patient concerns when confronted \nwith the prospect of symphysis grafting is a change in facial \nor soft tissue appearance. The idea of having a permanent \nbony chin defect or ptosis contributes to a patient’s apprehen-\nsion regarding this procedure.\nComplication. The main concern of patients after a symphy-\nsis graft is a postoperative change in the soft tissue contour \nof the chin. In the literature, there exists no evidence of a \nstatistically signiicant incidence of dehiscence or chin ptosis \nafter a symphysis graft.\nPrevention. Avoid degloving the mentalis muscle by main-\ntaining the facial and inferior aspects of the mandible and the \nlingual aspect of the inferior border of the mandible during \nlap refection. Additionally, to prevent lower lip height reduc-\ntion and vermilion zone inversion, the integrity of the peri-\nosteum to the inferior relection should not be deeper than \none third of the total distance from the vermilion border to \nthe mucogingival junction.

Detachment of a block graft due to an integration \nfailure may be caused by a lack of suficient preparation of \nthe recipient site during the grafting process. Many recipient \ngraft sites are covered with dense cortical bone, particularly \nin the mandible, and proper angiogenesis and eventual osteo-\ngenesis requires passage of the cellular components through \nthis dense bone.\nComplication. As an implant is placed into an osteotomy that \nhas been prepared in a block graft site, expanding pressure is \nexerted around the circumference of the surrounding bone. If \na block graft is not fully integrated into the underlying bone, it \nwill separate and the block will detach. A similar situation is \nfound in particulate grafting if the developed ridge is not dense \nand is not fully integrated to the recipient site. In this situation, \nthe particulate graft does not have suficient density to allow for \nadequate implant support and the lateral aspect of the newly \nregenerated ridge will crumble around the coronal aspect of the \nimplant as the implant is inserted into the osteotomy.\ncomplications. Despite this, there are patients with anatomic \nrestrictions that make them poor candidates for ramus graft \nharvesting.\nComplication. The main complication related to ramus \ngrafting is the possibility of signiicant damage to the inferior \nalveolar nerve (IAN) where its course passes directly adjacent \nto the external oblique ridge (buccal shelf). Patients who have \nan IAN location 10 mm or less from the external oblique have \na much greater chance of a nerve impairment during a graft \nharvest from that region. Additionally, this limited dimension \nlimits the amount of bone that is available for harvesting. The \nclinician may damage the associated nerves with an aggressive \nharvest in an attempt to get an adequate volume of bone.\nPrevention. CBCT analysis can provide the clinician with a \nclear picture as to how viable the ramus site is from a nerve \ninjury prevention standpoint as well as the chance of acquir-\ning a suficient volume of bone for grafting. Measurements \nshould be taken to assess the anterior-posterior (A-P) width \nof the ramus, the distance from the external oblique and \nramus body to the IAN, and the overall width of the posterior \nramus.

(B) The decortication must be deep enough \nto cause bleeding, thus allowing blood vessels into the area. \nB\nA\nPrevention. All recipient sites must be thoroughly decorti-\ncated with a bur to not only open a pathway for cellular \npassage of the osteogenic cells through the dense cortical \nbone but also to stimulate the RAP in the region. It is highly \nsuggested that the same drill size for the ixation screws be \nused for these deep penetrating holes and that adequate \nbleeding be present to ensure passage of the bone growth \nfactors into the site (Fig. 12.51).\nMobility of the Block (Fig. 12.52 A and B)\nComplication. Mobility of an autogenous or allograft block \nduring the healing process will almost always result in a graft \nfailure. Mobility of the block prevents proper integration of \nthe newly forming bone, and eventually it will lead to soft \ntissue invasion between the block and the recipient site. Rigid \nixation of the block graft to the recipient bone site is critical \nfor success in the regenerative process.\nEtiology. Although regeneration with block grafting is \nrelated to the concept of “barrier by bulk,” micromovement \nwill often contribute to a weak bond between the cortical \ngraft and the recipient site. This will potentially cause the \nblock to separate from the ridge as pressure is placed on the \ninterface between the native bone and the integrated block as \na result of the implant being inserted into the osteotomy. The \nmost common cause for graft mobility is insuficient ixation \nor pressure from a prosthesis postoperatively.\nPrevention. Initial ixation of a block graft must be attained \nwhen the block is originally placed in the recipient site. Any \nmovement of the block during the healing process will disrupt \nthe formation of a stable clot around the migrating cells, and \na loose block will not integrate into the host bone. Ideally, two \nixation screws should be used in every block graft, eliminating \nany micromovement of the block during the healing process. \nThe recipient site should be prepared for close approximation \nof the surface of the block graft to the recipient site.

A longer \nshaft on the supporting screw may be necessary to obtain \nridge ixation in soft bone. The screws should have a self-\nthreading tip, and the preparation hole should be prepared \ndeep enough to prevent the shaft of the screw from bottom-\ning out in dense cortical bone. Excess insertion pressure \non a screw passing into very dense bone without adequate \ndepth preparation can contribute to the head of the screw \nsnapping off during its insertion. Most updated ixation \nscrews have a pointed self-threading screw tip that helps with \nscrew insertion.\nTreatment. If micromovement of the block graft occurs \nduring surgery, the block should be removed and the screws \nshould be replaced with longer or wider ixation screws. If the \nmovement occurs during the healing phase, the block should \nbe monitored carefully to see if by chance it continues to \nintegrate. If the movement continues, a decision will have to \nbe made to remove the graft, attempting a second graft at a \nfuture time (Figs. 12.53, 12.54, and 12.55).\nStoring Graft in Incorrect Medium (Fig. 12.56)\nEtiology. During graft surgery an ideal scenario would allow \nthe clinician to immediately transfer harvested graft material \ndirectly into the recipient site. In many cases, this is not pos-\nsible, requiring the use of a storage medium to safely store \ngraft material (autograft or allograft) prior to usage. Due to \nits separation from a blood supply, the cells inside of the graft \nare vulnerable to death and must be stabilized during storage \nfor the graft to survive.\nComplication.

Bone ixation screws are routinely placed in the \nbony ridge for various reasons during implant-related surgery. \nIt is not uncommon to ind the end of a screw extending \nbeyond the lingual or palatal cortical plate. When this occurs, \nthere is a potential for the overextended screw to cause \ndiscomfort.\nComplication. Overextended screws can be a source of irri-\ntation to the thin soft tissue on the lingual aspect of the \nmandible. The movement of the thin mucosa and tongue \nagainst the sharp point of the screw can cause quite a bit of \ndiscomfort. This is not usually an issue in the maxilla, where \nthe thicker nature of the palatal tissue acts as a protective \nbuffer.\nPrevention. Screw placement should be followed by both a \nvisual inspection of the opposing surface of cortical bone and \na digital review of any potential problems areas that will need \ncorrection.\nTreatment. The only way to treat an overextended screw \ninvolves relection of a lap to provide access for removal of \nthe overextension or removal of the complete screw. Screw \nremoval is not usually a reasonable solution because that \nwould require relection of the tissue overlying the maturing \ngraft site and disruption of the graft as the screw is removed \n(Fig. 12.57).\nBlock Separation From Bony Ridge During \nImplant Placement\nEtiology. Bone grafting always involves the development of \nnewly regenerated bone into an existing recipient site. In \nthe case of a block graft, the cortical block assists with the \naugmentation process through the concept of “barrier by \nbulk.” In this process, the block serves a role in maintaining \nspace during early angiogenesis and osteogenic development \ninto and throughout the cortical block.

This disruption of the recipient bone will stimulate \nthe RAP, promoting good bony integration into the host site \n(Figs. 12.58 to 12.60).\nNasopalatine Canal/Incisive Foramen \nInvolvement in Regeneration Sites\nEtiology. Implant restorations in the anterior maxillary \nregion present one of the most dificult challenges in \ndentistry today. The combination of aesthetic demands, \nbiomechanical/functional issues, and phonetic challenges \nrequire implant placement in ideal positions. The incisive \nforamen is the exit site of the nasopalatine canal where the \nterminal branch of the descending palatine artery and naso-\npalatine nerve pass into the oral cavity. The proximity of the \nincisive foramen and the path of the canal must be evaluated \nin all maxillary incisor implant treatment plans because there \ncan be signiicant variations in the size, position, and angula-\ntion of the nasopalatine canal and the exiting foramen. As \nthe bone around the maxillary central incisors resorbs, the \nzone of available bony support moves palatally, frequently \nencroaching on the incisive foramen.\nPrevention. Deining the dimensions and pathway of the \nnasopalatine canal with CBCT imaging allows the surgeon to \ndecide if implants can be placed within the required restor-\native space or if augmentation will be needed for ideal place-\nment. This is particularly important in cases involving \nimmediate implants because the lingual angulation of the \nimmediate implant osteotomy could potentially fenestrate \ninto the incisive canal. A fenestration in the side of an oste-\notomy allows neural/ibrous tissue invasion into the osteot-\nomy, retarding bone growth and rigid ixation of the implant. \nAxial CBCT images provide the most accurate view of the \nsize, shape, and location of the canal in respect to the possible \nimplant sites. Use of CBCT cross sections and 3-D images can \nalso help determine the positions and dimensions of this \nimportant anatomic variant. The clinician must be aware of \na possible widening of the canal above the level of the \nforamen, creating a fenestration between the canal and the \nosteotomy in the more apical regions of the osteotomy. As \nthe cross sections of the CBCT are reviewed, the possible \npresence of a nasopalatine cyst should be ruled out, and eden-\ntulous arches should be reviewed for an enlarged foraminal \ndimension, as is often noted. The positions of implants in \ncentral incisor regions where the foramen is involved should \nbe adjusted distally where an FP-1 restoration does not \nrequire a speciic placement. This slight adjustment distally \nprevents fenestration on the mesiopalatal line angle, where \nthis deiciency most likely will occur (Fig. 12.61).\nComplication. Severe bone resorption on the facial aspect of \nthe maxilla reduces the ridge thickness to surprising extents, \noften leaving only a thin ridge that is positioned well to the \npalatal aspect of the required location for a central incisor \nimplant. It should be kept in mind that a line between the \ncingula of the two cuspids passes directly over the incisal \nforamen. Subsequently, if an implant is placed this far pala-\ntally, the emergence proile will originate at a signiicantly \nproclined angle and the complete restoration will be palatally \npositioned. Cases like this require that the seriously deicient \nridge be regenerated prior to implant placement.\nAn osteotomy that fenestrates into the nasopalatine canal \nopens the site to neural and ibrous tissue invasion at the \ninterface of the implant and the exposure. This will lead to a \nfailure to integrate and loss of the implant. A signiicant inva-\nsion into the canal could lead to excessive bleeding during \nsurgery that is usually self-limiting with pressure and time.\nTreatment. Regions that are determined to be deicient will \nrequire facial augmentation using techniques that are capable \nof generating enough lateral/vertical bone volume for proper \nimplant placement and restorative success. Cases where the \nimplant can be moved slightly in a distal direction can some-\ntimes prevent the need for major augmentation. Another \noption is the obliteration and grafting of the nasopalatine \ncanal, which can aid in providing signiicant bone volume for \nimplant placement (Fig. 12.62).\nPOSTOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS\nExcessive Pressure on Ridge Augmentation Sites \nCaused by Temporary Prostheses\nEtiology. The successful maturation of a bone graft site \nrequires that the area be completely protected from micro-\nmovement and disruption of the covering membrane or \nblock material. Micromovement of 25 μm can decrease the \ninal graft volume as much as 40%. The most common source \nof daily pressure on a site comes when the patient’s transi-\ntional appliance has contact with the surface of the graft site.\nComplication. Micromovement on a localized region of a \ngraft site will consistently yield compromised results in the \nmature graft development, if not full graft failure. It is imper-\native to take measures to prevent any movement of the graft \nduring healing.\nPrevention. A transitional appliance (lipper or removable \npartial denture) must be modiied to eliminate any signiicant \ncontact with the graft site. It is recommended that these \nremovable devices be avoided if possible. If a removable \nappliance is absolutely necessary, all buccal langes should be \nremoved and, if possible, the acrylic should be altered to \ncreate regions of support on the lingual surfaces of the adja-\ncent teeth. Occlusal rests should be utilized, or in cases where \nthis is not possible, there must be good adaptation of the \nprosthesis to direct the forces to alternative stress-bearing \nareas (tissue areas away from graft site that take the pressure \noff the graft site).\nEssix appliances allow at least temporary replacement of \nteeth in narrow span regions, allowing long-term appli-\nances to be fabricated after the initial healing process has \nbeen completed.

Ridge augmentation techniques require that the \nsoft tissue covering the graft site be released in the buccal \nvestibule to free the lap for a tension-free closure over the \nexpanded graft site. In most cases, this will move the keratin-\nized portion of the tissue lap to the top of the ridge with \naltered mucosal positioning.

As the mucogingival junction in a healing \naugmentations site is evaluated, it is often noted that the \nremaining keratinized tissue over the grafted site is now \npalatally/lingually positioned. The complete buccal aspect of \nthe ridge in these cases is covered with loose and mobile \nmucosa, contributing to restorative and esthetic issues.\nPrevention. The clinician must be aware of the restorative \nimplications of the soft tissue related changes that can occur \nduring augmentation procedures. Unattached mucosa that \nis stretched over restorative areas provides an esthetically \nunacceptable and restoratively dificult situation. This can be \naddressed with either preoperative tissue grafting or it can be \ncorrected after the graft site has completed its healing process. \nThe preoperative approach utilizes a large autogenous palatal \ntissue graft over the edentulous region prior to completion \nof the ridge augmentation procedure. The newly developed \nwide keratinized tissue band usually covers the augmentation \nsite without requiring extensive movement of the mucogin-\ngival junctional level as the widened graft site is covered. If \ngrafting is not completed preoperatively, tissue management \ncan be incorporated into the surgical sequencing, ultimately \ndeveloping proper tissue aesthetics and attachments. Discus-\nsions with the patient should be conducted prior to implant \nplacement to make sure they are well informed about the \nexpected need of additional procedures that could be neces-\nsary in correction of soft tissue complications."

Management of high attachment levels of \nmucosa over previous augmentation sites requires either pre-\noperative tissue grafting or postgrafting tissue management. \nIf there is an expected deiciency, one of these options will \nneed to be chosen:\n• Option 1. Postgrafting approaches are organized \naround development of a new zone of thick keratinized \ntissue that will not only provide a strong attachment \napparatus that will surround the implant abutment but \nwill also allow a favorable emergence proile and better \ninterproximal tissue papilla heights. The preferred \nmethod in our experience involves use of either autog-\nenous connective tissue or the thicker type of AlloDerm \n(acellular dermal matrix) that is placed during the \nimplant surgery. At the time of implant placement, a \nlayer of connective tissue or AlloDerm is placed over \nthe area of concern to prepare a thicker soft tissue foun-\ndation. After the healing process has been completed, a \nsimple split-thickness dissection of the mucosa is used \nto expose the underlying layer of dense tissue formed \nby the previously grafted connective tissue. The repo-\nsitioned mucosa is then sutured apical to the exposed \nregion with 5-0 chromic sutures. The resulting matured \nlayer of tissue will typically have a normal keratinized \nconsistency and appearance. In cases where the tissue \ncovering the augmentation site is very thin, efforts \nshould be made to develop 3 mm of tissue thickness \naround the neck of the implant. This may involve \nuse of more than one layer of connective tissue or \nAlloDerm on top of the ridge. This is especially relevant \nin the upper and lower posterior regions where large \namounts of tissue have been drawn over a wide aug-\nmentation site. Tomas Linkevivius has shown that very \nthin tissue around implant attachment zones is much \nmore prone to circumferential bone loss than implants \nin patients with a thick biotype and 3 mm or more of \ntissue thickness around the neck of the implant.51\n• Option 2. Dr. Esteban Urban describes another \napproach that is completed after the implants have \nbeen placed in a postregeneration site. In his technique, \nno grafting is completed at the time of implant place-\nment or before the grafting procedure. Instead, he \ndescribes use of a split-thickness lap over the zone of \nmucosal attachment, leaving the periosteum intact. A \nlarge piece of “mucograft” is sutured into place, cover-\ning all but a thin zone at the level of the mucosal suture \nline. A narrow piece of autogenous palatal tissue is \nsutured over this apical zone to create a protective band \nof keratinized tissue that limits relapse movement of \nthe mucosa over the region that was covered with"

Unfortunately, the postgrafted \ntissue has a white color tone related to the density and \nibrous nature of the palatal graft donor site. This discrep-\nancy prevents use of this approach in anterior augmenta-\ntion sites where the tissue color and surface contour is \nimportant (Figs. 12.67 to 12.70).\nBone Density Variations in Ridge Augmentations\nEtiology. The sole purpose of ridge augmentation and bone \ngrafting is to develop a dense stable volume of bony support \nfor implants of appropriate sizes and numbers that are placed \nin the locations speciied by the restorative plan. The quality \nand density of the inal graft development is important because \na weak and granular implant osteotomy site is more susceptible \nto crumbling during implant insertion. These granular ridges \ncan also resorb when the implant is loaded and stress is placed \non the coronal aspect of the implant/bone interface. As clini-\ncians plan augmentation procedures, they must understand \nthe limitations of the materials that they are using and the \ntechniques that are going to be utilized. Misch created a system \nof bone densities for implants, ranging from D1 (hardest) to \nD4 (softest/most porous).53 These divisions encompass the \nacceptable ranges for the placement and rigid ixation of \nimplants. Successful regeneration procedures develop a inal \nosteotomy site that provides adequate bone volume in a dense, \nirm, manageable form that has a large number of vital bone \ncells that will easily integrate with the titanium implant body.\nComplication. When an augmentation procedure is not com-\npleted using sound surgical principles or when an inappropri-\nate graft material is used, the completed implant site may \npresent with an inadequate bone density for rigid ixation of \nthe implant. The bone in these compromised sites will have a \ngranular appearance and feel. This lack of density indicates the \nlack of adequate bone turnover from the original nonvital graft \nparticles into a inal dense bony consistency with a high per-\ncentage of vital bone cells. Regenerative failures will have to be \nregrafted, lengthening the treatment time, the overall costs, and \nfrustrating the implant patient and the entire implant team.\nPrevention. Success in bone grafting of all types requires a \nthorough knowledge of the variety of grafting materials that \nare available and their capacity to be readily replaced with \nvital bone on a timely basis. A clear understanding of the \nconcepts of osteoinduction and osteoconduction is critical \nfor predictable grafting success. Use of totally osteoconduc-\ntive graft materials will signiicantly alter the time required \nfor substitution of vital bone for the nonvital products found \nin the donor graft. The incorporation of autogenous bone \ninto this process adds the osteoinductive capacity of autog-\nenous bone into the osteogenic process, accelerating the turn-\nover into vital bone and potentially creating a better ridge \nconsistency upon maturation. Demineralized freeze-dried \nbone allograft (DFBA) has some osteoinductive capacities, \nand the addition of a grafting material with this potential \nshould improve the outcome of the grafting procedure. \nThe use of bovine products has similar advantages and can \nmucograft. This region should granulate in with kera-\ntinized tissue. The thickness of tissue in this approach \nwill not be as deep as the option 1 approach, where \nmore than one layer of connective can be placed over \nthe implant site itself.52\n• Option 3. Free tissue grafting can be completed prior to \naugmentation of a region, using autogenous palatal \ntissue. In this approach, the recipient site is prepared with \na split-thickness dissection, leaving the periosteum intact. \nThe palatal graft is harvested from the palatal tissue adja-\ncent to the molars, avoiding the rugae in the anterior \nregion. One advantage of harvesting tissue in this manner \nis the surgeon’s ability to gauge how thick the inal tissue \nneeds to be and harvesting an appropriate graft from the \ndonor site. This creates a wide zone of thick keratinized \nFIG 12.66 (A) Grafting site. (B) Closure of ridge augmenta-\ntion.

Flap relection is a basic procedure that is common \nin all surgical applications. Correct tissue manipulation \nallows the lap to be released and relected without tearing or \ndamaging the underlying periosteal layer. The use of bone \nixation screws in particulate grafting techniques creates a \ncomplicated situation for lap relection because the ibrous \ntissue layer of the periosteum surrounds the head of the screw \nand any exposed portion of the neck of the screw. When the \nlap is drawn away from a screw insertion site, this ibrous \nlayer must be cut and the binding tissue must be released \nbefore the lap can continue to be drawn away from the \nregion.\nComplication. Flap relection in screw-supported regenera-\ntion sites will reveal tissue that binds around the heads of the \nsupporting screws. This binding attachment cannot be easily \ndrawn over the screw heads, and there is a potential to create \nperforations or tears in the lap as it is released.\nTreatment.

Maintenance of complete soft tissue coverage over \nhealing bone grafting sites is one of the most important prin-\nciples that must be observed for predictable grafting success. \nAny time that the healing graft site is exposed to the oral lora \nduring the healing process, there will be some type of com-\npromised change in the inal graft site volume and in its \noverall integrity.

If the lap has not been \nadequately released, this pressure will eventually lead to \nnecrosis of the tissue around the sutures, leading to an open \nincision postoperatively.\nThe inner surface of a relected lap is lined with the peri-\nosteum: a thin, dense layer of tissue that cannot be stretched. \nIt is impossible to stretch the soft tissue lap over a graft site \nwithout irst severing this layer of tissue. This “tissue release” \nis accomplished by preparing a clear and continuous releasing \nincision through the periosteum, exposing the underlying \nelastic layers of tissue that can then be released for expansion \nof the lap over the enlarged graft site. As this incision perfo-\nrates the periosteal layer, the two edges clearly separate, allow-\ning the elastic tissue below the periosteum to stretch. A sharp \npair of Metzenbaum scissors is then placed into the space \nbelow the periosteum, and as the scissor tips are opened, the \ntissue easily releases and the edges separate farther. This is \nrepeated until the complete lap is stretched over the graft site \nand 5 mm beyond the opposite lap margin.\nTreatment. In the event of an incision line opening, the \npatient should be placed on a frequent monitoring protocol \nto observe the status of the graft material and any grafting \nthe healing graft site. Exposure of the graft particles and the \npresence of purulence is an indication of impending failure \nof the graft. The infection lowers the pH in the graft site, \ncausing a breakdown of the graft particles and eventually \ncompromising the resulting ridge volume. Secondly, an open \nincision line may allow exposure and breakdown of the \nbarrier membrane, contributing to ibrous tissue ingrowth \ninto the graft site. Lastly, there exists a potential for particu-\nlate graft materials to escape the graft site, resulting in an \ninadequate bone volume in the inal proposed implant site.57\nPrevention. Tension-free tissue coverage can be most effec-\ntively managed from the standpoint of overall lap manage-\nment throughout the surgical procedure. A clinician’s \nexperience in manipulation of soft tissue affects this aspect of \nbone regeneration more than any other part of bone regenera-\ntion surgery. As the clinician gains more experience in delicate \ntissue management and begins to understand the maintenance \nof a tension-free lap closure, problems with graft and mem-\nbrane exposure will become a very uncommon occurrence.\nLack of tension-free closure. The most common cause of \nan exposed membrane along an open incision line is directly \nrelated to the lack of a tension-free closure of the lap.

Augmentation of a bony ridge requires assessment \nof the required position of the inal restoration prior to the \nregenerative procedure. This dictates how much bone will be \nneeded to support an implant in the proper position for an \nideal emergence proile of the crown. It is highly recom-\nmended that the augmentation be planned to overbuild the \nfacial bony contour enough to account for any alterations of \nthe graft volume that may occur during the healing process \nand for additional postoperative support on the facial of the \ngraft site. Thin bone on the facial aspect of any implant site \nis prone to remodeling and eventual resorption down the face \nof the implant body. Although there is bone on the facial \naspect of the implant in a thin graft site, this bone is suscep-\ntible to the natural stresses along the coronal 5 mm of the \nimplant, potentially leading to future problems.\nComplication. A lack of adequate facial bone regeneration \nleads to a site that may be prone to the development of a \ndehiscence during implant placement or inadequate support \nof the implant during loading and long-term use. Continued \nbreakdown like this eventually leads to the need for repair of \nthe exposed implant body or possible implant removal.\nPrevention. Planning is a vital ingredient in the prevention \nof this complication. The site should be evaluated via CBCT \nto assess the current volume of bone and to plan the appro-\npriate implant that will ensure stability and function during \nloading. Anterior implant sites should also be assessed for the \nnecessary angulation required to ensure a proper emergence \nproile. Once the implant site and prosthetic design have been \nchosen, the clinician may choose the proper graft technique \nto ensure adequate bone thickness. Ideally, after implant \nplacement 1.5 mm of bone should be present between the \nfacial aspect of the implant and the facial plate.\nSpace maintenance in a graft site is critical for predictable \ngraft development. The deinition of this inal graft outer \ncontour must be established with rigid support using a \ntitanium-supported membrane, tenting screws, titanium \nmesh, or other means of space support.

If an implant is placed in a regeneration site \nwhere the facial bone is thin or appears to be at risk due to a \npoor granular consistency, it is recommended that it be \ngrafted at the time of the implant placement. A layer of \nallograft or xenograft should be placed over the entire region \nof weak bone, and a collagen membrane should be placed \nover the particulate graft before closure.

The quality of bone in the apical region and \nover the facial aspect of the implant is very important from \na density standpoint because this critical region of support \nwill bear the strain when the implant restoration is loaded. \nDeiciencies or regions of thin bone often lead to the forma-\ntion of a dark coloration of the tissue on the facial aspect of \nthe implant, compromising the aesthetics of the entire case.\nApical ixation. Many authors have debated the need for \nixation of the membrane, but it has been the experience of \nthe authors that rigid ixation of the membrane is important \nfor the establishment and maintenance of the apical location \nof the graft volume. Membranes are easily ixed into position \nutilizing bone tacks or screws, but suturing the membrane to \nthe periosteum is another technique that can be used. It is \nimportant to note that ALL bone tacks should be removed at \nthe time of implant placement to prevent dislodgment at a \nlater time. It has been shown that loose tacks have the poten-\ntial of migrating through the soft tissue into the proximity of \nvital structures.\nsites are positioned so the apex of the implant will remain \nwithin the bony architecture. In some cases an apical fenes-\ntration will occur, and additional procedures will be needed \nto maintain predictable bony support.\nComplication. An apical fenestration in an implant osteot-\nomy occurs when the length of the osteotomy exceeds the \nlength of available bony support. This creates a situation that \nmost likely will lead to a lack of ixation, stability under load, \nand potential implant morbidity.\nPrevention. Augmentation procedures are designed to add \nhorizontal width to a deicient ridge. This lateral dimension \nneeds to be regenerated in a manner that provides support to \nthe entire length of the proposed implant.

Thirty million \npeople in the United States, or 17.5% of the adult population, \nare missing all of their maxillary teeth. In addition, 20% to 30% \nof the adult partially edentulous population older than 45 years \nis missing maxillary posterior teeth in one quadrant, and 15% \nof this age group is missing the maxillary dentition in both \nposterior regions. Approximately 40% of adult patients are \nmissing at least some maxillary posterior teeth.1\nThe maxillary posterior edentulous region presents many \nunique and challenging situations in implant dentistry. Most \nnoteworthy surgical methods include maxillary sinus grafts \nto increase available bone height, onlay grafts to increase bone \nwidth, and modiied surgical approaches to insert implants \nin areas with poorer bone density. Grafting of the maxillary \nsinus to overcome the problem of reduced vertical available \nbone has become a very popular and predictable procedure \nover the last decades. This grafting procedure has been proven \nto provide the clinician with adequate bone volume to place \nan implant of ideal size and proper orientation. However, this \nanatomic area is responsible for more complications in oral \nimplantology than any other region in the oral cavity.\nANATOMIC DISADVANTAGES TO  \nTHE POSTERIOR MAXILLA\nPneumatization of the Maxillary Sinus\nAfter posterior tooth loss, the maxillary sinuses enlarge, \nwhich presents a unique problem for implant placement. A \ncontinued increase of osteoclastic activity within the perios-\nteum of the maxillary sinus (Schneiderian membrane) results \nin expansion. An elevated positive pressure within the sinus \nwill also increase alveolar bone atrophy allowing for pneuma-\ntization, thus decreasing the available bone for implant place-\nment.2 An inverse relationship between sinus pneumatization \nand the remaining alveolar bone exists due to remodeling \nand the normal/pathologic status of the dentoperiodontal \napparatus (Fig. 13.1).\nClinical Implication. The net result of maxillary sinus \npneumatization is the deiciency in bone height for implant \nplacement, thus requiring augmentation for increased bone \nquantity for future implant placement. With proper grafting \ntechniques to increase bone volume, this anatomic area may \nbe restored to a more predictable biomechanical location for \nfuture implant placement. If grafting is not completed where \nbone quantity is not adequate, an increased morbidity may \nresult with failure or migration of implants.\nRidge Width/Lingual Repositioning\nThe maxilla has an inherently thinner facial cortical plate in \ncomparison to other areas of the mouth (e.g., mandible) \nbecause of rapid resorption after tooth loss. The loss of maxil-\nlary posterior teeth results in an initial decrease in bone width \nat the expense of the labial bony plate. This process occurs at \na faster rate than in any other region of the oral cavity.3 The \nresorption phenomenon is accelerated by the loss of vascu-\nlarization of the alveolar bone and existing ine trabecular \nbone type. However, because the initial residual ridge is \ninherently wide in the posterior maxilla, even with a 60% \ndecrease in the width of the ridge, adequate-diameter root \nform implants usually can be placed. As further time passes, \nthe ridge shifts toward the palate until the ridge is resorbed \ninto a medially positioned narrower bone volume.4 The pos-\nterior maxilla continues to progressively remodel toward the \nmidline as the bone resorption process continues.\nClinical Implications. Because of the less than ideal width \nof bone, buccal-lingual implant placement may not be ideal. \nStudies have shown that it is possible to perform ridge aug-\nmentation to increase width at the time of sinus grafting, but \nthere is an increased rate of morbidity and implant failure \nwhen compared to sinus grafting alone. Due to the more \nlingual position of the ridge, implants will be placed more \nlingual than is ideal. Prosthetically, this will often result in the \nbuccal cusp of the inal restoration being cantilevered facially \nto satisfy esthetic requirements at the expense of biomechan-\nics in the moderate to severely atrophic ridges (Fig. 13.2).1 In \nsome severe resorption cases, the posterior maxillary implants \nare more ideally restored in a crossbite occlusion.\nBone Density\nThe bone quality in the posterior maxilla is usually poorer \nthan in any other intraoral region. Bone strength is directly \nrelated to its density, and the low-density bone of this region \nis often ive to ten times weaker compared with bone found \nin the anterior mandible.5 The various bone densities directly"

To \nincrease BIC and success with posterior maxilla implants, the \nsurgical and prosthetic technique requires modiication; \nunder preparation of the surgical site, use of osteotomes, \ngreater healing periods, and progressive bone loading during \nthe prosthetic phase of treatment (Fig. 13.3).\nAnatomic Location\nBecause of the anatomic location (posterior maxilla), ade-\nquate surgical access is often a dificult problem because of a \nlack of interocclusal space. With the length of the handpiece \nand surgical drill often exceeding 40 mm, the posterior \nmaxilla is one of the most dificult areas to complete a suc-\ncessful osteotomy. The implant clinician is often unable to \ndrill the osteotomy with the correct angulation (Fig. 13.4) \nbecause of the opposing occlusion.\nClinical Implications. The implant surgeon is often con-\nfronted with lack of interocclusal space, increasing the difi-\nculty in all aspects of the surgical procedure. Visibility is \ndiminished in the posterior maxilla, especially when increased \nbleeding occurs. This area also becomes very uncomfortable \nfor the patient, especially if there is a positive gag relex.\nThe lack of space also presents an issue with utilizing \nsurgical templates, especially those guided by cone beam \ncomputed tomography (CBCT), because minimal space is \navailable to accommodate the surgical drill along with the \nsurgical template. However, newer surgical templates have \nbeen fabricated with the buccal aspect of the drilling tubes \nremoved (buccal access), which allows the implant clinician \nadditional space to prepare the osteotomy.\nPredisposition to Pathology\nThe paranasal sinuses, especially the maxillary sinus, have \nbeen shown to be very susceptible to various disease pro-\ncesses. Studies have shown that in approximately 46% percent \nof asymptomatic patients requiring augmentation in the \nmaxillary sinus, some degree of pathology exists.6 The pathol-\nogy can range from incipient membrane inlammation to \nfully opaciied sinuses.\nClinical Implications. The implant clinician must have a \nworking knowledge of the maxillary sinus anatomy, anatomic \nvariants, and associated pathology. It is imperative the patency \nof the maxillary ostium be determined prior to placement of \nan implant or bone graft into the maxillary sinus. To mini-\nmize postoperative morbidity, the clinician must understand \nthe indications for otolaryngologist (ENT) referral and clear-\nance prior to any procedures that would involve grafting pro-\ncedures into the maxillary sinus.\nUNDERSTANDING PARANASAL SINUS \nANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY\nTo decrease the morbidity of treatment in the posterior \nmaxilla, knowledge of the important structures of the area \ninluence the bone-implant contact (BIC) percent, which \naccounts for the transmission of forces to the bone. The \nposterior maxilla most commonly exhibits D4 bone (Misch \nclassiication), which has the greatest biomechanical elastic \nmodulus difference when compared with titanium under \nload. D4 bone is characterized by ine trabeculae with very \nlittle cortical bone. Implants placed into D4 bone are most \nsusceptible to bone loss and increased morbidity. As such, \nstrategic surgery techniques (e.g., under-preparation, use of \nosteotomes) when placing implants in the posterior maxilla \nto increase BIC are suggested.\nClinical Implications. Because the BIC is least in D4 bone, \nthe stress patterns (i.e., from biomechanical force) in this \nbone type migrate farther toward the apex of the implant. As \na result, bone loss is more pronounced and occurs more api-\ncally along the implant body, while in denser bone types (D1), \nFIG 13.1 Pneumatization can be signiicant even with teeth \npresent as the maxillary sinus increases in size, leaving less \navailable bone for implant placement. \nFIG 13.2 In the posterior maxilla the buccal plate resorbs \nfaster than any other area of the oral cavity. As resorption \nprogresses from division A to B to C to D, the residual ridge \nis positioned more lingual. This results in the eventual implant \nbeing placed more lingual, potentially in crossbite with the \nmandibular posterior teeth or at a nonideal angle. \nA\nA\nB\nB\nC\nC\nD\nD"

The epithelial lining of the maxillary sinus is much \nthinner and contains fewer blood vessels than the nasal epi-\nthelium. This accounts for the membrane’s pale color and \nbluish hue. Five primary cell types exist in this tissue: (1) cili-\nated columnar epithelial cells, (2) nonciliated columnar cells, \n(3) basal cells, (4) goblet cells, and (5) seromucinous cells. \nThe ciliated cells contain approximately 50 to 200 cilia per \ncell. In a healthy maxillary sinus the cilia cells assist in clearing \nmucus from the sinus and into the nasopharynx. The noncili-\nated cells compose the apical aspect of the membrane, contain \nmicrovilli, and serve to increase surface area. These cells have \nbeen theorized to facilitate humidiication and warming of \ninspired air. The basal cell’s function is similar to that of a \nstem cell that can differentiate as needed. The goblet cells in \nthe maxillary sinus produce glycoproteins that are responsi-\nble for the viscosity and elasticity of the mucus produced. The \nmaxillary sinus contains the highest concentration of goblet \ncells in comparison with the other paranasal sinuses. The \nmaxillary sinus membrane also exhibits few elastic ibers \nattached to the bone7 (no tenacious attachment is usually \npresent), which simpliies elevation of this tissue from the \nbone during grafting procedures. The thickness of the sinus \nmucosa in health varies, but is generally 0.3 to 0.8 mm.8 In \nsmokers, it varies from very thin and almost nonexistent to \nvery thick, with a squamous type of epithelium.\nRadiographic Evaluation. A CBCT scan of normal, healthy \nparanasal sinuses reveals a completely radiolucent (dark) \nmaxillary sinus. Any radiopaque (whitish) area within the \nsinus cavity is abnormal, and a pathologic condition should \nbe suspected. The normal sinus membrane is radiographi-\ncally invisible, whereas any inlammation or thickening of \nthis structure will be radiopaque. The density of the diseased \ntissue or luid accumulation will be proportional to varying \ndegrees of gray values.\nClinical Implications. Maintaining the integrity of the sinus \nmembrane is crucial in decreasing postoperative complications, \nincluding loss of graft material and the possibility of infection. \nMany factors may alter the physiology of the sinus mucosa such \nas viruses, bacteria, and foreign bodies (implants). Care should \nbe taken to minimize membrane perforations during surgery. \nIf perforations occur, appropriate repair treatment protocols \nshould be adhered to (see Sinus Perforations).\nMucociliary Drainage\nNormal mucociliary low is crucial to maintaining the healthy \nphysiology of the maxillary sinus. In a healthy sinus an \nadequate system of mucus production, clearance, and \ndrainage is maintained. The key to normal sinus physiology \nis the proper function of the cilia, which is the main compo-\nnent of the mucociliary transport system. The cilia move \ncontaminants toward the natural ostium and then to the \nFIG 13.4 (A) Because of the anatomic location, implant oste-\notomies are often complicated in the posterior region because \nof lack of interocclusal space. Nonideal implant angulation \noften results.

The \nostium diameter averages 2.4 mm in health; however, patho-\nlogic conditions may alter the size to vary from 1 to 17 mm.1\nThe maxillary ostium and infundibulum are part of the \nanterior ethmoid middle meatal complex, the region through \nwhich the frontal and maxillary sinuses drain, which is pri-\nmarily responsible for mucociliary clearance of the sinuses to \nthe nasopharynx. As a result, obstruction in one or more \nareas of the complex will usually result in rhinosinusitis or \nlead to morbidity of the graft or implant.\nClinical Implications. Patency of the maxillary ostium is \nmost crucial pre- and postoperatively during maxillary graft \nsinus surgery to prevent infection and morbidity of the graft. \nEvaluating the patency of the ostium via a CBCT is easily \naccomplished with evaluation of serial cross-sectional images. \nA prophylactic regimen including antibiotics and corticoster-\noids should always be utilized when grafting or during \nimplant placement in the sinus proper to maintain patency \nof the ostium during the postoperative period."

It is important to maintain the patency of \nthe maxillary ostium and the osteomeatal complex in the \npostoperative period.\nThe physiologic mucociliary transport system may be \ncompromised by abnormalities in the cilia, which include a \ndecrease in overall ciliary number and poor coordination of \ntheir movement. This altered physiology may result in an \nincreased morbidity of implant placement or bone graft \nhealing. Therefore, it is crucial that the mucociliary drainage \nmechanism be maintained throughout the postoperative \ntreatment period. This is most likely accomplished with good \nsurgical technique, evaluation and treatment of prior drain-\nage issues, and strict adherence to the use of pharmacologic \nagents (e.g., antibiotics, corticosteroids).\nMaxillary Sinus Flora\nThere is much debate on the bacterial lora of the maxillary \nsinus. Maxillary sinuses have been considered to be sterile in \nhealth; however, bacteria can colonize within the sinus \nwithout producing symptoms. In theory, the mechanism by \nwhich a sterile environment is maintained includes the \nmucociliary clearance system, immune system, and the pro-\nduction of nitric oxide within the sinus cavity. In recent endo-\nscopic studies, normal sinuses were shown to be nonsterile, \nwith 62.3% exhibiting bacterial colonization. The most \ncommon bacteria cultured were Streptococcus viridans, Staph-\nylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumonia.10 The \nculture indings for secretions in acute maxillary sinusitis \nyielded high numbers of leukocytes, S. pneumoniae, or Strep-\ntococcus pyogenes, with Haemophilus inluenzae being recov-\nered from the purulent exudates with lower numbers of \nnasopharynx. The cilia of the columnar epithelium beat \ntoward the ostium at 15 cycles per minute, with a stiff stroke \nthrough the serous layer, reaching into the mucoid layer. They \nrecover with a limp reverse stroke within the serous layer. This \nmechanism slowly propels the mucoid layer toward the \nostium at a rate of 9 mm per minute and into the middle \nmeatus of the nose.8\nIn health, mucoid luid is transported toward the ostium \nof the maxillary sinus and drains into the nasal cavity, elimi-\nnating inhaled small particles and microorganisms. This \nmucociliary transport system is an active transport system \nthat relies heavily on oxygen. The amount of oxygen absorbed \nfrom the blood is not adequate to maintain this drainage \nsystem; additional oxygen has to be absorbed from the air in \nthe sinus. This is why the patency of the ostium is crucial in \nmaintaining the normal transport system.\nVarious elements may decrease the number of cilia and \nslow their beating eficiency. Viral infections, pollution, aller-\ngic reactions, and certain medications may affect the cilia in \nthis way.9 Genetic disorders (e.g., dyskinetic cilia syndrome) \nand factors such as longstanding dehydration, anticholinergic \nmedications and antihistamines, cigarette smoke, and chemi-\ncal toxins also can affect ciliary action (Fig. 13.6).\nClinical Implications. An alteration in the sinus ostium \npatency or the quality of secretions can lead to disruption in \nciliary action, which may result in rhinosinusitis.\nFor clearance to be maintained, adequate ventilation is \nnecessary. Ventilation and drainage is dependent on the \nosteomeatal unit, which is the main sinus opening.

A strict aseptic technique should be adhered \nto during any surgical procedures that invade the maxillary \nsinus proper.

Ideally, Augmentin (875/125 mg) has been \nshown to be most effective in the maxillary sinus.\nBlood Supply\nThe vascular supply in the maxillary sinus is a vital part of \nthe healing and regeneration of bone after a sinus graft and \nhealing of a dental implant. The blood supply to the maxillary \nsinus comes directly from the maxillary artery, which ema-\nnates from the external carotid artery. The maxillary artery \nsupplies the bone surrounding the sinus cavity and also the \nsinus membrane. Branches of the maxillary artery, which \nmost often include the posterior superior alveolar artery and \ninfraorbital artery, form endosseous and extraosseous anas-\ntomoses that encompass the maxillary sinus. The formation \nof the endosseous and extraosseous anastomoses in the max-\nillary sinus is termed the double arterial arcade. Studies have \nshown vascularization of postgraft material to depend on the \nintra- and extraosseous anastamoses, along with the blood \nvessels of the Schnedierian membrane, which is supplied by \nthe posterior superior alveolar artery and the infraorbital \nartery along the lateral wall.11\nThere exists different factors that alter the vascularization \nin this area. With increasing age the number and size of blood \nvessels in the maxilla decrease. As bone resorption increases, \nthe cortical bone becomes thin, resulting in less vasculariza-\ntion. As the lateral wall becomes thinner, the blood supply to \nthe lateral wall and lateral aspect of the bone graft comes \nprimarily from the periosteum, resulting in a compromised \nvascularization to the region.\nExtraosseous Anastomosis. Extraosseous anastomosis is \nfound in approximately 44% of the population and is usually \nin close approximation to the periosteum of the lateral wall. \nThe extraosseous anastomosis is superior to the endosseous \nunit, which is approximately 15 to 20 mm from the dentate \nalveolar crest.\nComplication prevention. To minimize vascular trauma \nto the extraosseous anastomosis, surgical and anatomic con-\nsiderations should be addressed. Ideally, vertical incisions \nshould be made as short as possible to decrease the possibility \nof blood vessel damage. It is crucial to gain adequate access \nto the lateral aspect of the maxilla, and the periosteum should \nbe relected full thickness with great care. Haphazard relec-\ntion may lead to severing or damage to the anastomosis with \nresultant postoperative edema.\nTreatment implication. Severing of the extraosseous anas-\ntomosis may result in signiicant increased bleeding during \nthe surgical procedure. This intraoperative complication may \ngive rise to impaired visibility for the clinician along with \nincreased surgery duration. Additionally, postoperative com-\nplications such as pain, edema, and ecchymosis may result \nfrom the severing of these blood vessels.\nIf trauma to these vessels occurs, direct pressure or the use \nof electrocautery may be used. However, electrocautery may \npotentially cause membrane damage or necrosis. If severe \nbleeding occurs, curved Kelly hemostats are used to clamp the \nbleeding vessel followed by ligature placement. A slowly \nresorbable suture with high tensile strength such as Vicryl is \nrecommended.\nIntraosseous Anastomosis. The intraosseous anastomosis \nis found within the lateral wall of the sinus, which supplies \nthe lateral wall and the sinus membrane. In an edentulous \nmaxilla with posterior vertical bone loss, the endosseous \nanastamosis may be 5 to 10 mm from the edentulous ridge. \nThe endosseous artery has been shown to be observed on \nCBCT scans in approximately one half of the patients requir-\ning a sinus graft.12 However, anatomic cadaver studies have \nshown the prevalence to be 100%.13 In 82% of cases the most \ncommon anatomic location was observed between the canine \nand second premolar region.14 However, with a long-term \nedentulous patient with a thin lateral wall, the artery may be \natrophied and almost nonexistent.\nComplication prevention. Surgical, radiographic, and \nanatomic considerations should be addressed to minimize \ntrauma to these blood vessels. The CBCT radiographic iden-\ntiication is extremely important in identifying these blood \nvessels prior to surgery so preparation may be made. Radio-\ngraphically, smaller anastomoses will not be seen if the pixel \nsize (~1.0 mm) is less than one-half the size of the anastamo-\nsis vessel. Using a 0.3 or 0.4 CBCT pixel size for radiographic \nevaluation will most likely show the smaller anastomoses.15\nStudies have shown that in 20% of lateral wall osteoto-\nmies, signiicant bleeding complications may occur.16 This is \nmainly due to the anastomosis being greater than 1.0 mm in \ndiameter. It has been shown that vessels larger than 1.0 mm \nare more problematic and associated with signiicant bleed-\ning, whereas smaller vessels (<1.0 mm) are usually insignii-\ncant and easily managed (Fig. 13.7).\nTreatment implication. In most cases, bleeding is a minor \ncomplication and of short duration; however, in some \ninstances it may be signiicant and dificult to manage. To \ncontrol bleeding, there are many possible treatments: (1) the \npatient should be repositioned into an upright position and \npressure applied with a surgical sponge; (2) electrocautery \nmay be used, although this may lead to membrane necrosis \nand perforation with possible migration of graft material; (3) \na second window may be made proximal to the bleeding \nsource to gain access to the bleeding vessel, especially if loca-\ntion cannot be obtained from the original window; and (4) \ncutting the bone and vessel with a high-speed diamond with \nno irrigation (which cauterizes the vessel). (See Bleeding \nChapter)\nPosterior Lateral Nasal Artery. A posterior lateral nasal \nartery (branch of the sphenopalatine artery that also rises \nfrom the maxillary artery) supplies the medial aspect of the \nsinus cavity.

The implant \nclinician should have a strong understanding and foundation \nof these structures in the preoperative assessment prior to \nsurgical procedures (Fig. 13.8).\nAnterior Wall\nThe anterior wall of the maxillary sinus consists of thin, \ncompact bone extending from the orbital rim to just above \nthe apex of the cuspid. With the loss of the canine, the ante-\nrior wall of the antrum may approximate the crest of the \nresidual ridge. Within the anterior wall and approximately 6 \nto 7 mm below the orbital rim, with anatomic variants as far \nas 14 mm from the orbital rim, is the infraorbital foramen. \nThe infraorbital nerve runs along the roof of the sinus and \nexits through the foramen. The infraorbital blood vessels and \nnerves lie directly on the superior wall of the sinus and within \nthe sinus mucosa. The infraorbital nerve gives sensory inner-\nvation to the soft tissue from the lower border of the orbit to \nlateral of the nose to the upper lip (Fig. 13.9A).\nComplication Implications\nSinus infection. Tenderness to pressure over the infraorbital \nforamen or redness of the overlying skin may indicate \nexercised to minimize trauma to this area because aggressive \nrelection of the membrane may result in trauma to the blood \nvessel or perforation into the nasal cavity.\nTreatment implication. Trauma to this artery may cause \nsigniicant bleeding in the sinus proper and also within the \nnasal cavity. Because the medial sinus wall is very thin (usually \none-half the thickness of the lateral wall), aggressive mem-\nbrane relection may result in trauma leading to bleeding \nissues (see Chapter 7).\nSphenopalatine/Infraorbital Arteries. The sphenopalatine \nartery is also a branch of the maxillary artery and enters the \nnasal cavity through the sphenopalatine foramen, which is \nnear the posterior portion of the superior meatus of the nose. \nAs the sphenopalatine artery exits the foramen, it branches \ninto the posterior lateral nasal artery and the posterior septal \nartery.17 Additionally, the infraorbital artery enters the maxil-\nlary sinus via the infraorbital issure in the roof of the sinus \nand ascends cranially into the orbital cavity. Because of the \nanatomic locations of these blood vessels, it is rarely a concern \nwith respect to sinus graft surgery.\nComplication implications. The sphenopalatine and \ninfraorbital blood vessels are usually not problematic for \nbleeding complications during lateral-approach sinus eleva-\ntion surgery because of their anatomic locations. However, \nincorrect incision locations and aggressive relection may \ndamage the blood vessels. If bleeding does occur, it is usually \neasily controlled with pressure and local hemostatic agents.\nFIG 13.7 (A) The extra- and intraosseous anastomosis, which is made up of the infraorbital and \nposteriorsuperior artery.

The posterior wall usually has several \nvital structures in the region of the pterygomaxillary fossa, \nincluding the internal maxillary artery, pterygoid plexus, \nsphenopalatine ganglion, and greater palatine nerve. The pos-\nterior wall should always be identiied on the radiograph. \nWhen a posterior wall is not present, a pathologic condition \n(including neoplasms) is to be suspected (Fig. 13.9C).\nComplication Implications\nBleeding. Common donor sites to obtain autogenous \nbone for sinus augmentation procedures include the tuberos-\nity area. Special consideration should be taken on the poste-\nrior extent of the tuberosity removal. Aggressive tuberosity \nremoval may lead to bleeding in the infratemporal fossa \n(pterygoid plexus), resulting in life-threatening situations.\nPterygoid implants. It should be noted that pterygoid \nimplants placed through the posterior sinus wall and into this \nregion might approach vital structures, including the maxil-\nlary artery. A blind surgical technique to place a pterygoid \nimplant through the posterior wall may have increased surgi-\ncal risk. However, they are of beneit primarily when third or \nfourth molars are needed for prosthetic reconstruction or \nsinus grafts are contraindicated and available bone posterior \nto the antrum is present.\nMedial Wall\nThe medial wall of the antrum coincides with the lateral wall \nof the nasal cavity and is the most complex of the various \nwalls of the sinus. On the nasal aspect the lower section of \nthe medial wall parallels the lower meatus and loor of the \nnasal fossa; the upper aspect corresponds to the middle \nmeatus. The medial wall is usually vertical and smooth on the \nantral side. Located in the superior aspect of the medial wall \nis the maxillary or primary ostium (Fig. 13.9D).\nComplication Implications\nVerify patency. The patency of the ostium must be ascer-\ntained prior to surgery to prevent postoperative complica-\ntions. This is easily veriied via coronal or cross-sectional \nimages on CBCT surveys. Of utmost importance is the \npatency of the ostium, which must be maintained throughout \nthe postoperative period. If ostium patency is compromised, \nincreased morbidity of the graft will occur as the mucociliary \naction of the maxillary sinus will be compromised.\nAccessory ostia. Smaller, accessory or secondary ostia \nmay be present that are usually located in the middle meatus \nposterior to the main ostium. These additional ostia are most \nlikely the result of chronic sinus inlammation and mucous \nmembrane breakdown. They are present in approximately \n30% of patients, ranging from a fraction of a millimeter to \n0.5 cm, and are commonly found within the membranous \nfontanelles of the lateral nasal wall.18 Fontanelles are usually \nclassiied either as anterior fontanelles (AFs) or posterior fon-\ntanelles (PFs) and are termed by their relation to the uncinate \ninlammation of the sinus membrane from infection or trauma, \nwhich may contraindicate graft surgery until resolution.\nNerve impairment. In patients exhibiting anatomic vari-\nants, neurosensory impairment may occur during retraction \nof this area leading to neurapraxia type injuries. The use of \nworn, sharp-edged retractors should be avoided when relect-\ning tissue superiorly in this area. Within the anterior wall of \nthe sinus, the thinnest part is the canine fossa, which is \ndirectly above the canine tooth. The anterior wall of the max-\nillary sinus may also serve as surgical access during Caldwell-\nLuc procedures to treat a preexisting or post–sinus graft, \npathologic condition.\nSuperior Wall\nThe superior wall of the maxillary sinus coincides with the \nthin inferior orbital loor. The orbital loor slants inferiorly \nin a mediolateral direction and is convex into the sinus cavity. \nA bony ridge is usually present in this wall that houses the \ninfraorbital canal, which contains the infraorbital nerve and \nassociated blood vessels. Dehiscence of the bony chamber \nmay be present, resulting in direct contact between the infra-\norbital structures and the sinus mucosa (Fig. 13.9B).\nComplication Implications\nInfection. Ocular symptoms may result from infections or \ntumors in the superior aspects of the sinus region and may \ninclude proptosis (bulging of the eye) and diplopia (double \nvision). When these problems occur, the patient is closely \nsupervised and a medical consult is advised to decrease the \nrisk of severe complications that may result from the spread \nof infection in a superior direction. Superior-spreading infec-\ntions may lead to signiicant ocular problems or brain \nabscesses. As a result, when ocular or cerebral symptoms \nappear, aggressive therapy to decrease the spread of infection \nis indicated. Overpacking the maxillary sinus with bone graft \nmaterial during a sinus graft may result in pressure against \nthe superior wall if a sinus infection develops.\nFIG 13.8 The six bony walls of the maxillary sinus: anterior, \nmedial, lateral, superior, posterior, and inferior walls."

The cartilage is termed the quadrangular cartilage \nand the bones are comprised of the maxillary alveolar crest, \nvomer bone, and the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid. A \ndeviated septum occurs when the cartilaginous ridge leans to \nthe right or left, resulting in an obstruction of the nasal pas-\nsages that separates the right and left nasal cavities. The nasal \nseptum is the bone and cartilage in the nose that separates the \nnasal cavity into the two nostrils. Normally, the septum lies \ncentrally, and thus the nasal passages are symmetrical.5 Studies \nhave shown a prevalence of septal deviation in up to 70% of \nthe population.21 A deviated septum may be diagnosed by \nevaluating the coronal or 3-D CBCT images (Fig. 13.10A).\nComplication Implications\nOstium blockage. When this bony structure is maligned \nor deviated, the patient may be at risk of postoperative com-\nplications. This bony variant in extremes may cause obstruc-\ntion of the osteomeatal complex, which results in inlammation \nfrom air turbulence, causing increased mucosal drying and \nparticle deposition. If deviation is signiicant, or if preopera-\ntive sinus pathology is present, an ENT consultation is recom-\nmended. It should be noted that the ipsilateral side usually \nwill have normal clearance issues and less of a possibility of \npostoperative complications.\nConcha Bullosa\nThe middle turbinate plays a signiicant role in the proper \ndrainage system of the maxillary sinus. Normally, this bony \nstructure is lined by nasal respiratory mucosa. A variation of \nthe middle turbinate is a concha bullosa, which is a pneuma-\ntization (air bubble) within the middle turbinate. The most \nideal CBCT image to diagnose a concha bullosa is a coronal \nimage. This variant has been shown to be present in approxi-\nmately 4% to 15% of the population (Fig. 13.10A–B).22\nComplication Implications\nOstium blockage. When a concha bullosa is present, the \nimplant clinician should carefully conirm the patency of the \nmaxillary ostium and any pathology in the maxillary sinus. \nA concha bullosa may decrease the size of the middle meatus, \ninterfering with normal mucociliary low out of the maxillary \nsinus. Normally, this variant does not require surgical correc-\ntion unless patency issues are present for which ENT evalua-\ntion and correction are indicated. Usually, corrective surgery \nincludes a turbinectomy, which is the turbinate being reduced \nin size by endoscopic nasal surgery.\nParadoxical Middle Turbinate\nAnother variant within the middle turbinate is a paradoxi-\ncally curved middle turbinate, which presents as a concavity \ntoward the septum (backwards), decreasing the size of the \nwill reveal the osseous thickness of the lateral wall, which is \ncrucial in deining the osteotomy location and preparation \ntechnique. Patients exhibiting increased parafunction forces \nwill have thicker lateral walls (Fig. 13.9E).\nComplication Implications\nVarying thickness. The lateral wall thickness of the \nmaxilla has been noted to be extremely variable, with some \ncases being nonexistent. This will lead to an increased pos-\nsibility of membrane perforation, even occurring on relec-\ntion. In contrast, the lateral wall may be very thick, which is \nusually seen with patients that exhibit parafunction and have \njust recently lost the posterior teeth. In these situations, lateral \nwall sinus grafting becomes very dificult because of the corti-\ncal thickness.\nBleeding. The lateral wall houses the intraosseous anasta-\nmosis of the infraorbital and posterior superior alveolar \nartery, which may lead to a bleeding complication because \nthis area is the site for osteotomy preparation of the lateral \nwall sinus graft procedure.\nInferior Wall\nThe inferior wall or loor of the maxillary sinus is in close \nrelationship with the apices of the maxillary molars and pre-\nmolars. The teeth usually are separated from the sinus mucosa \nby a thin layer of bone; however, on occasion, teeth may \nperforate the loor of the sinus and be in direct contact with \nthe sinus lining. Studies have shown that the irst molar has \nthe most common dehiscent tooth root, occurring up to \napproximately 30% of the time.19 In dentate patients the loor \nis approximately at the level of the nasal loor. In the edentu-\nlous posterior maxilla the sinus loor is often 1 cm below the \nlevel of the nasal loor (Fig. 13.9F).\nComplication Implications\nIrregular loor. Radiographically, the sinus inferior loor \nmorphology is easily seen via 3-D imaging. The loor is rarely \nlat and smooth; the presence of irregularities and septa \nshould be determined and their exact locations noted. Irregu-\nlar loors are most often seen after teeth are extracted, leaving \nresidual bony crests that increase risk of perforation because \nof the dificulty in membrane relection. In some cases, the \nbony crests are not even seen on the CBCT evaluation.\nSepta. Complete or incomplete bony septa may exist on \nthe loor in a vertical or horizontal plane. Approximately 30% \nof dentate maxillae have septa, with three fourths appearing \nin the premolar region. Complete septa separating the sinus \ninto compartments are very rare, occurring in only 1.0% to \n2.5% of maxillary sinuses.20 The presence of septa complicate \nlateral wall sinus graft procedures, which leads to an increased \nlikelihood of membrane perforation.\nANATOMIC VARIANTS\nNumerous anatomic variants arise that may predispose a \npatient to postsurgical complications.

A paradoxical \nmiddle turbinate is most easily seen on a CBCT coronal \nimage with a prevalence of approximately 26% (Fig. 13.10C).\nComplication Implications\nOstium blockage. When present, the implant clinician \nshould carefully conirm the patency of the maxillary ostium \nand any pathology in the maxillary sinus. The paradoxical \nmiddle turbinate may place pressure on the uncinate process, \nleading to a non-patent maxillary sinus ostium. A paradoxical \nmiddle turbinate may decrease the size of the middle meatus, \ninterfering with normal low out of the maxillary sinus.\nUncinate Process Variants\nA delected uncinate process (either laterally or medially) can \nnarrow the ethmoid infundibulum, which affects the patency \nof the osteomeatal complex. Perforations may also be present \nwithin the uncinate process, leading to communication \nbetween the nasal cavity and ethmoid infundibulum. In addi-\ntion, the uncinate process may be pneumatized and is a \ncommon area for ENT intervention in the treatment of \nchronic rhinosinusitis.\nComplication Implications\nOstium blockage. A delected uncinate process may lead to \nnarrowing of the low out of the ostium, causing patency issues. \nWhen present, the implant clinician should carefully conirm \nthe patency of the maxillary ostium and any pathology in the \nmaxillary sinus. A delected uncinate process may decrease the \nsize of the middle meatus, interfering with normal low out of \nthe maxillary sinus. This may lead to post-operative complica-\ntions after implant or bone graft surgery in the maxillary sinus.\nHaller Cells\nHaller cells, also known as infraorbital ethmoidal air cells or \nmaxilloethmoidal cells, are pneumatized ethmoidal air cells. \nThey project from the orbital loor and arise most often from \nthe anterior ethmoids in approximately 34% of the popula-\ntion.23 Hallers cells are most easily seen on coronal images.\nComplication Implications\nIncreased incidence of rhinosinusitis. In most cases, \nHaller cells are asymptomatic and generally are associated \nwith an increased incidence of rhinosinusitis. They may \nbecome infected and potentially extend into the orbit. Addi-\ntionally, Haller cells may compromise the patency of the max-\nillary sinus ostium and also have been associated with chronic \npolypoid disease, which both may compromise and predis-\npose to postsurgical disease (Fig. 13.11).\nSupplemental Ostia\nA supplemental ostium or secondary ostia may occur between \nthe maxillary sinus and the middle meatus, which is often \nfound in the posterior fontanelles (PF). The prevalence of \nsupplemental or accessory ostia is approximately 18% to \n30%. On occasion, these secondary ostia may be encountered \nFIG 13.10 (A) Concha bullosa (arrow) and deviated septum. \n(B) Large left-sided concha bullosa (red arrow), deviated \nseptum to the right, and paradoxical middle turbinate (green \narrow).

The \nprevalence of this condition has been documented to be \napproximately 3%.\nComplication Implications\nLack of bone for implant placement. When the patient \nhas this condition, the maxillary sinus is lateral to the eden-\ntulous ridge. When inadequate bone height is present below \nthis structure, a sinus graft does not increase available bone \nheight for an implant. If a clinician is unaware of this variant, \nthe implant may inadvertently be placed into the nasal cavity \nabove the residual ridge and has been shown to penetrate the \ninferior meatus and contact the inferior turbinate. A sinus \ngraft is usually contraindicated with this patient condition \nbecause the sinus is lateral to the position of the implants. \nInstead, an onlay graft is required to increase bone height and \nwidth (Fig. 13.13).\nPATHOLOGY\nPathologic conditions associated with the paranasal sinuses \nare common ailments and aflict more than 31 million people \neach year. Approximately 16 million people will seek medical \nduring the membrane elevation off of the medial wall of the \nantrum, prior to placement of the sinus graft.\nComplication Implications\nRecirculation. Because these secondary openings are \nusually located posterior and inferior to the natural ostium, \nthey may predispose the patient to rhinosinusitis by the recir-\nculation of infected secretions from the primary meatus back \ninto the sinus cavity. The presence of supplemental ostia may \nincrease morbidity for maxillary sinus graft patients. When \nobserved, a piece of collagen is placed over the site to prevent \ngraft material from entering the nasal cavity.\nMaxillary Hypoplasia\nHypoplasia of the maxillary sinus may be a direct result of \ntrauma, infection, surgical intervention, or irradiation to the \nmaxilla during the development of the maxillary bone. These \nconditions interrupt the maxillary growth center, which pro-\nduces a smaller than normal maxilla. The negative pressure \nwithin the maxillary sinus resulting from chronic ostial \nobstruction impedes the pneumatization process of the sinus, \nresulting in hypoplasia. Usually, a malformed and positioned \nuncinate process is associated with this disorder, leading to \nchronic sinus drainage problems. Maxillary sinus hypoplasia \nhas been reported in 1.73% to 10.4% of patients with sinus \nsymptoms; however, it is sometimes asymptomatic.24\nComplication Implications\nPredisposition to disease. Although patients with hypo-\nplastic maxillary sinuses exhibit a greater incidence of sinus \npathology and clearance issues, the impact on the placement \nof implants in this area is negligible. Because of the smaller \nsize of the sinus, there is a greater volume of available bone, \nnegating the need for augmentation procedures. Usually, \nimplant placement may be completed well below the inferior \nborder of the sinus (Fig. 13.12).\nInferior Turbinate and Meatus Pneumatization \n(Big-Nose Variant)\nA rare anatomic variant, which has a signiicant impact on \nimplant treatment planning, is an inferior meatus pneumatiza-\ntion, or big-nose variant. When the nasal cavity pneumatizes \nFIG 13.11 Haller cells. The arrows deine Haller cells, which are air cells beneath the ethmoid \nbulla and along the roof of the maxillary sinus.

Poten-\ntial infection in the region of the sinuses may result in severe \ncomplications such as chronic rhinosinusitis, orbital celluli-\ntis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, and cavernous sinus thrombo-\nsis. In fact, paranasal sinus infections account for approximately \n5% to 10% of all brain abscesses reported each year.25\nA preexisting, pathologic, maxillary sinus condition is a \ncontraindication for many procedures that alter the sinus \nloor before or in conjunction with sinus grafting and/or \nimplant insertion. The risk of postoperative infection is ele-\nvated and may compromise the health of the implant and the \npatient. Pathologic conditions, either preoperative or postop-\nerative, of a maxillary sinus should be evaluated, diagnosed, \nand treated if indicated.\nPathologic conditions of the maxillary sinus may be \ndivided into ive categories: (1) inlammation, (2) cystic con-\nditions, (3) neoplasms, (4) fungal, and (5) antroliths/foreign \nbodies. Studies have shown approximately 45% of the asymp-\ntomatic population has a subclinical pathologic condition in \nthe maxillary sinus. A study completed at the Misch Inter-\nnational Implant Institute evaluated over 1000 consecutive \nprospective candidates for maxillary sinus augmentations. \nThe results concluded 32.7% of asymptomatic patients had \nmaxillary sinus pathologic conditions on CBCT scan evalua-\ntion. Because of this high incidence, it is highly recommended \nthat a thorough radiographic evaluation be completed on all \nprospective sinus elevation patients (Fig. 13.22).\nINFLAMMATORY\nOdontogenic Sinusitis (Periapical Mucositis)\nOdontogenic rhinosinusitis occurs when the maxillary sinus \nmembrane is violated by infection of teeth or pathologic \nlesions of the jaws. The intimate approximation of the roots \nof the maxillary posterior teeth to the loor of the sinus may \nresult in inlammatory changes of the periodontium or sur-\nrounding alveolar bone. These changes may initiate the devel-\nopment of pathologic conditions in the maxillary sinus.\nEtiology. Odontogenic rhinosinusitis is caused by a periapi-\ncal abscess, cyst, granuloma, or periodontal disease that \nresults in an expansile lesion within the loor of the sinus. \nOther causes include sinus perforations during extractions \nand foreign bodies (e.g., gutta-percha, root tips, amalgam). \nOdontogenic rhinosinusitis is often polymicrobial, with \nanaerobic streptococci, Bacteroides spp, Proteus spp, and coli-\nform bacilli being involved. Studies have reported that \napproximately 30% to 40% of chronic sinusitis cases may \nhave some odontogenic origin when teeth are present in the \nposterior maxilla.26 Approximately 42% of the time, one or \nmore roots of the maxillary irst molar root will protrude into \nthe sinus cavity along with 40% of second molars roots.27\nRadiographic Appearance. Periodontitis may produce \ngeneralized sinus mucosal hyperplasia, which is seen as a \nradiopaque band that follows the contours of the sinus loor. \nA localized periapical mucositis reveals a thickening of \nthe mucous membrane adjacent to the offending tooth and, \non occasion, a perforation through to the loor of the sinus. \nThis radiographic appearance has been termed a halo effect \n(Fig. 13.14A)."

In patients \nwith recurrent episodes of sinusitis, oxygen tension is often \nreduced, even when infection is not present. As a conse-\nquence, a history of recurrent acute rhinosinusitis is relevant \nto determine whether an implant may be at increased risk \nwhen inserted at the same time as the sinus graft.\nRadiographic Appearance. The radiographic hallmark in \nacute rhinosinusitis is the appearance of an air-luid level. A \nline of demarcation will be present between the luid and the \nair within the maxillary sinus. If the patient is supine (CBCT), \nthe luid will accumulate in the posterior area; if the patient \nis upright during the imaging, the luid will be seen on the \nloor and be horizontal. Additional radiographic signs include \nsmooth, thickened mucosa of the sinus, with possible opaci-\nication. In severe cases, the sinus may ill completely with \nsupportive exudates, which gives the appearance of a com-\npletely opaciied sinus. With these characteristics the terms \npyocele and empyema have been applied (Fig. 13.15A–B).\nDifferential Diagnosis. Radiographically, the appearance of \nan air-luid level is present with acute rhinosinusitis. The dif-\nferential diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis and prolonged viral \nupper respiratory infection are very similar. However, a classic \nair-luid level in the maxillary sinus will give rise to the con-\nirmation of acute rhinosinusitis. Additionally, viral rhinosi-\nnusitis will usually improve within 7–10 days, whereas acute \nbacterial rhinosinusitis most likely will persist for longer than \n10 days.29\nTreatment. Because acute rhinosinusitis is one of the most \ncommon health problems today, patients having sinus aug-\nmentation procedures should be well screened for a past \nhistory and current symptoms. Even though acute rhinosi-\nnusitis is a self-limiting disease, a symptomatic patient should \nbe treated and cleared by the physician before grafting pro-\ncedures. These patients are also more prone to postoperative \nrhinosinusitis. As a result, a more conservative approach is to \ncomplete the sinus graft and allow for several months of \nhealing before the placement of the implant.\nChronic Rhinosinusitis\nChronic rhinosinusitis is a term used for a sinusitis that does \nnot resolve in 6 weeks and also has recurrent episodes. It is \nthe most common chronic disease in the United States, affect-\ning approximately 37 million people. Symptoms of chronic \nsinusitis are associated with periodic episodes of purulent \nnasal discharge, nasal congestion, and facial pain.\nEtiology. As maxillary rhinosinusitis progresses from acute \nto chronic, anaerobic bacteria become the predominant \npathogens. The microbiology of chronic rhinosinusitis is very \ndificult to determine because of the inability to achieve \naccurate cultures. Studies have shown that possible bacteria \ninclude Bacteroides spp, anaerobic gram-positive cocci, Fuso-\nbacterium spp, as well as aerobic organisms (Streptococci spp, \nDifferential Diagnosis. Odontogenic rhinosinusitis pre-\nsents with a thickening of the mucous membrane adjacent to \na diseased tooth exhibiting a radiographic radiopaque band. \nThis condition may be confused with acute rhinosinusitis or \nmild mucosal thickening. However, in odontogenic rhinosi-\nnusitis, the patient has teeth in the posterior maxilla and will \nusually exhibit symptoms related to the teeth (e.g., pain from \na posterior tooth or a recent extraction, exudate around the \nexisting natural posterior teeth).\nTreatment. Before sinus augmentation or implant place-\nment, the tooth or teeth involved should be treated periodon-\ntally or endodontically, or extracted. After intraoral soft tissue \nhealing and resolution of the pathologic condition, the sinus \ngraft procedure may be performed with minimal risk of post-\noperative complications. A CBCT scan should be taken \napproximately 12–16 weeks postoperatively to determine \nsinus status, including sinus ostium patency.\nAcute Rhinosinusitis\nThe most common sinusitis in the maxillary sinus is a non-\nodontogenic pathologic condition resulting in inlammation \nand infection termed acute rhinosinusitis. The signs and \nsymptoms of acute rhinosinusitis are rather nonspeciic, \nmaking it dificult to differentiate from the common cold, \ninluenza type of symptoms, and allergic rhinitis. Usually \npatients will present with symptoms such as purulent nasal \ndischarge, facial pain and tenderness, nasal congestion, and \npossible fever. Acute maxillary rhinosinusitis results in 22 to \n25 million patient visits to physicians in the United States \neach year, with a direct or indirect cost of 6 billion US dollars.25\nEtiology. Acute rhinosinusitis is an inlammatory process \nthat extends from the nasal cavity after a viral upper respira-\ntory infection. Microbiologic cultures have shown the most \ncommon pathogens causing acute rhinosinusitis to be Strep-\ntococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus inluenzae, and Moraxella \ncatarrhalis. These pathogens include approximately 20% to \n27% beta-lactamase–resistant bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus \nhas also been cited with the microbiology of acute rhinosi-\nnusitis. However, this pathogen is usually seen only in noso-\ncomial (hospital-induced) sinusitis and is unlikely to be seen \nin elective sinus graft patients.\nThe most important factor in the pathogenesis of acute \nrhinosinusitis is the patency of the ostium.28 Mucous produc-\ntion within the sinus is usually abnormal in quality or quan-\ntity, along with a compromised mucociliary transport. In an \noccluded sinus, an accumulation of inlammatory cells, bac-\nteria, and mucus exists. Phagocytosis of the bacteria is \nimpaired with immunoglobulin (Ig)-dependent activities \ndecreased by the low concentration of IgA, IgG, and IgM \nfound in infected secretions.\nThe oxygen tension inside the maxillary sinus has signii-\ncant effects on pathologic conditions. When the oxygen \ntension in the sinus is altered, rhinosinusitis occurs. Growth \nof anaerobic and facultative organisms proliferate in this \nenvironment. Many factors may alter the normal oxygen"

Most commonly, these polyps are located \nnear the ostium and are easily observed on a CT or CBCT \nexamination. In advanced cases, ostium occlusion, along with \ndisplacement or destruction of the sinus walls may be present, \nwith a radiographic image of a completely opaciied sinus.\nTreatment. Special attention must be given to these patients \nto ensure a patent ostium and lack of bacterial resistance. Close \npostoperative supervision is highly recommended. The polyp, \nif enlarged, may be removed before the sinus graft by an ENT. \nThis may be performed through an anterior Caldwell-Luc \napproach or by an endoscopic procedure through the ostium.\nAllergic rhinosinusitis patients often have a greater risk of \ncomplications related to an increase in allergen production. \nBecause sinus grafting is an elective procedure, the time \nof year for the surgery may be altered to decrease the postop-\nerative infection risk. For example, if hay fever or a grass \nallergy is related to the patient’s sinusitis, the sinus graft \nsurgery should be performed in the season or seasons that \nhave least risk to aggravate the sinus mucosa (i.e., winter or \nfall) (Fig. 13.16).\nCYSTIC LESIONS\nCystic lesions are a common occurrence in the maxillary \nsinus, and studies have reported a prevalence range of 2.6% \nto 20%.34 They may vary from microscopic lesions to large, \ndestructive, expansile pathologic conditions, which include \npseudocysts, retention cysts, primary mucoceles, and postop-\nerative maxillary cysts.\nPseudocysts (Mucous Retention Cyst)\nThe most common cysts in the maxillary sinus are mucous \nretention cysts. After much controversy, in 1984, Gardner35 \nHaemophilus spp, Staphylococcus spp).30 A recent Mayo Clinic \nstudy showed that in 96% of patients with chronic sinusitis, \nactive fungal growth was also present.31\nRadiographic Appearance. Chronic rhinosinusitis may \nappear radiographically as thickened sinus mucosa, complete \nopaciication of the antrum, and/or sclerotic changes in the \nsinus walls (which give the appearance of denser cortical \nbone in the lateral walls). Chronic rhinosinusitisis is usually \ndiagnosed from coronal CBCT images.\nTreatment. Medical evaluation and clearance by a physician \nexperienced in sinus pathology is highly recommended for \npatients with chronic maxillary rhinosinusitis before sinus \ngrafting because signiicant bacterial resistance and fungal \ngrowth is highly probable. Fungal infections may be dificult \nto treat and control, and serious complications may result in \npostoperative sinus graft patients. It is imperative that chronic \nrhinosinusitis patients be cleared by an ENT because these \ntypes of patient may be contraindicated for sinus graft surgery \n(Fig. 13.15C).\nAllergic Rhinosinusitis\nEtiology. Allergic rhinosinusitis is a local response within \nthe sinus caused by an irritating allergen in the upper respira-\ntory tract. This allergen may be a cause of acute or chronic \nrhinosinusitis. This category of sinusitis may be the most \ncommon form, with 15% to 56% of patients undergoing \nendoscopy for sinusitis showing evidence of allergy. This con-\ndition often leads to chronic sinusitis in 15% to 60% of \npatients.32 The sinus mucosa becomes irregular or lobulated, \nwith resultant polyp formation.\nRadiographic Appearance. Polyp formation related to \nallergic rhinosinusitis is usually characterized by multiple, \nFIG 13.15 (A) Axial CT scan shows an air-luid level in the right antrum. The attenuation of this \nluid is less than that of muscle and typically is watery sinus secretions.

A pseudocyst is caused by an accumulation of luid \nbeneath the periosteum of the sinus mucosa, which elevates \nthe mucosa away from the loor of the sinus, giving rise to a \ndome-shaped lesion. Pseudocysts have also been termed \nmucosal cysts, serous cysts, and nonsecreting cysts.

Most \noften, an ENT physician should evaluate this condition before \nthe sinus graft. If a pseudocyst is less than 8 mm, less concern \nis needed and the luid may be drained in conjunction with \nsinus grafting, depending on the surgeon’s experience in the \ntreatment of this condition. This should be accomplished \nwith care to prevent membrane perforation. A strict recall \nevaluation of these previously infected areas following sinus \ngraft surgery is in order because reoccurrence of a pseudocyst \nis common. Many studies have shown the successful place-\nment of dental implants in conjunction with the presence of \npseudocysts.35b-d In rare cases, the pseudocyst may present \nwith clinical symptoms such as headache or pain that may \nrequire surgical intervention.\nRetention Cysts\nThe second type of mucous retention cyst is termed a reten-\ntion cyst. Retention cysts may be located on the sinus loor, \nnear the ostium, or within antral polyps. Because they contain \nan epithelial lining, researchers consider them to be mucous \nsecretory cysts and “true” cysts. Retention cysts are often \nmicroscopic in size.\nEtiology. Retention cysts result from partial blockage of sero-\nmucinous gland ducts located within the connective tissue \nunderlying the sinus epithelium. As the secretions collect, they \nexpand the duct, producing a cyst that is encompassed by \nrespiratory or cuboidal epithelium. They may be caused by \nsinus infections, allergies, or odontogenic conditions.\nRadiographic Appearance. Retention cysts are usually very \nsmall and not seen clinically or radiographically. In rare instances, \nthey may achieve adequate size to be seen in a CT image and \nmay resemble the appearance of a small pseudocyst.\nTreatment. No treatment for retention cysts exists before or \nin conjunction with a sinus graft and/or implant insertion.\nPrimary Maxillary Sinus Mucocele\nA primary mucocele is a cystic, expansile, destructive lesion \nthat may include painful swelling of the cheek, displacement \nof teeth, nasal obstruction, and possible ocular symptoms.36\nEtiology. The primary mucocele arises from blockage of the \nmaxillary ostium by ibrous connective tissue. Because of the \ncompromised drainage, the mucosa expands and herniates \nthrough the antral walls. The primary mucocele is classiied \nas a cyst because of the epithelial lining, which contains \nmucin. As the mucoid secretions increase, the protein content \nof the cyst results in the molality increasing, which attracts \nmore luid to the lesion. As the hydrostatic pressure increases, \nthe mucocele becomes elevated, resulting in pressure necrosis \nand bony erosion.35a\nRadiographic Appearance. In the early stages, the primary \nmucocele involves the entire sinus and appears as an opaciied \nare not true cysts because they lack an epithelial lining. The \ncause of the luid is bacterial toxins from the sinus mucosa \nor from odontogenic sources. Histologically, the pseudocyst \nappears as a smooth, light blue, translucuent structure illed \nwith a thin, clear, yellowish luid.35a\nRadiographic Appearance. Pseudocysts are depicted radio-\ngraphically as smooth, homogenous, dome-shaped, round \nto ovoid, well-deined radiopacities. Pseudocysts do not have \na corticated (radiopaque) marginal perimeter and are always \nlocated on the loor of the sinus cavity (Fig. 13.17A–B). \nIn rare cases, the pseudocyst can completely opacify the \nsinus cavity.\nTreatment. Pseudocysts are usually not a contraindication \nfor sinus graft surgery. If a large pseudocyst is present, the \nelevation of the membrane during a sinus graft may raise the \ncyst to occlude the ostium. In addition, on elevation or place-\nment of the grafting material, the cyst may be perforated, \nallowing luid within the cyst to contaminate the graft.

They comprise less \nthan 1% of all malignancies, with poorly differentiated squa-\nmous cell carcinoma being the most common. Most neo-\nplasms of the maxillary sinus remain asymptomatic and \nsometimes will mimic rhinosinusitis.37a\nEtiology. Primary malignant tumors within the maxillary \nsinus are usually caused by squamous cell carcinomas or \nadenocarcinomas. Signs and symptoms of malignant disease \nare related to the surrounding sinus wall that the tumor \ninvades and includes swelling in the cheek area, pain, anes-\nthesia or paresthesia of the infraorbital nerve (e.g., anterior \nwall), and visual disturbances (e.g., superior wall). These \ntumors in the sinus are usually nonspeciic and give rise to a \nvariety of consequences, including opaciied sinuses, soft \ntissue masses in the sinus, as well as sclerosis, erosion, or \ndestruction of the walls of the sinus. Sixty percent of squa-\nmous cell carcinomas of the paranasal sinuses are located in \nthe maxillary sinus, usually in the lower one half of the \nantrum. Clinical signs in the oral cavity relect the expansion \nof the tumor and an increased mobility of the involved teeth. \nInvasion of the infratemporal fossa is also possible. 25\nRadiographic Appearance. Radiographic signs of neo-\nplasms may include various-sized radiopaque masses, com-\nplete opaciication, or bony wall changes.

In the late stages, destruction of one or more \nsurrounding sinus walls is evident (Fig. 13.18).\nTreatment. This type of lesion requires ENT evaluation and \ntreatment. Surgical removal (e.g., enucleation) of this cyst is \nindicated before any bone augmentation procedures.\nPostoperative Maxillary Cyst  \n(Secondary Mucocele)\nA postoperative maxillary cyst of the maxillary sinus is a \ncystic lesion that usually develops secondary to a previous \ntrauma or surgical procedure in the sinus cavity. It has also \nbeen termed a surgical ciliated cyst, postoperative maxillary \nsinus mucocele, or a secondary mucocele.37\nEtiology. A postoperative maxillary cyst develops as a direct \nresult of trauma or past history of surgery within the maxil-\nlary sinus. The cyst is derived from the antral epithelium and \nmucosal remnants that previously were entrapped within the \nprior surgical site. This separated mucosa results in an \nepithelium-lined cavity in which mucin is secreted. The \nantrum becomes divided by a ibrous septum in which one \npart drains normally, whereas the other part is composed of \nthe mucocele. It is relatively rare in the United States; however, \nit constitutes approximately 24% of all cysts in Japan, mainly \ndue to a high incidence of rhinosinusitis.\nRadiographic Appearance. The cyst radiographically pre-\nsents as a well-deined radiolucency circumscribed by sclero-\nsis. The lesion is usually spherical in the early stages, with no \nbone destruction. As it progresses, the sinus wall becomes \nthin and eventually perforates. In later stages, it will appear \nas two separated anatomic compartments (Fig. 13.18B–C).\nTreatment.

Three possible clinical signs may \ndifferentiate fungal sinusitis from acute or chronic rhinosi-\nnusitis: (1) no response to antibiotic therapy; (2) soft tissue \nchanges in sinus associated with thickened reactive bone, \nwith localized areas of osteomyelitis; (3) association of \ninlammatory sinus disease that involves the nasal fossa and \nfacial soft tissue. In some cases, a positive diagnosis may \nrequire mycologic and histologic studies.\nRadiographic Appearance. Fungal rhinosinusitis is usually \nunilateral (78% of cases) with bony destruction being very \nrare. Within the sinuses, the presence of mild thickening to \ncomplete opaciication may be present. In most cases, varying \ndegrees of density (“double-densities”) are seen (Fig. 13.20).\nTreatment. Patients with a history or current knowledge of \nfungal rhinosinusitis should be referred to their physician or \notolaryngologist for treatment and surgical clearance. Treat-\nment usually involves debridement and therapy with an anti-\nfungal agent, such as amphotericin B. The history of fungal \nrhinosinusitis contraindicates elective sinus graft surgery in \nmany cases.\nANTROLITHS\nMaxillary Sinus Antroliths\nMaxillary sinus antroliths are the result of complete or partial \nencrustation of a foreign body that is present in the sinus. \nImplant placement or sinus grafts in areas affected by neo-\nplasms are contraindicated.\nFUNGAL RHINOSINUSITIS (EOSINOPHILIC \nFUNGAL RHINOSINUSITIS)\nGranulomatous rhinosinusitis is a very serious (and often \noverlooked) disorder within the maxillary sinus.

The invasive clas-\nsiication includes: (1) acute invasive (fulminant), (2) granu-\nlomatous invasive, and (3) chronic invasive. The noninvasive \ndiseases include: (1) saprophytic fungal infestation, (2) fungal \nball, and (3) fungus-related eosinophilic.37b\nEtiology. Fungal infections are usually caused by aspergil-\nlosis, mucormycosis, or histoplasmosis.33 Chronic rhinosi-\nnusitis patients should always be evaluated for granulomatous \nconditions, because a high percentage of fungal growth exists \nin this patient population.

Some \nof the most common treatment options that would be a \ncompromise would include mini-implants, shorter implants, \nplacing implants at a nonideal angle to avoid the sinus, and \nzygomatic implants.\nThese methods are not without their own pitfalls because \nthey pose biomechanical dilemmas to the implant in the \nprosthetic phase (Fig. 13.23).\nComplication Prevention\nIn 1984, Misch postulated various treatment approaches to \nthe posterior maxilla based on the amount of bone below \nthe antrum, and later to include the available bone width \nthat was related to implant design (Fig. 13.24).41 In the Misch \nSA (Sinus Augmentation) classiication, the treatment modal-\nity is dependent on the available bone height between the \nloor of the antrum and the crest of the residual ridge in the \nregion of the ideal implant locations. The SA protocol also \nsuggested a surgical approach, ideal bone graft material (lay-\nering technique), and a timetable for healing before pros-\nthetic reconstruction.\nSA-1. The irst Misch SA treatment option, SA-1, occurs \nwhen suficient bone height is available to permit the place-\nment of endosteal implants following a conventional surgical \nprotocol. Because the quality of bone in the posterior maxilla \noften is D3 or D4 bone (poorer quality), bone compaction to \nprepare the implant site is common. The use of osteotomes \nallow for the osteotomy site to be increased in size while \nallowing for the bone to be laterally compacted. This permits \na more rigid initial ixation of the implant and also increases \nthe bone implant contact (BIC) after initial healing.\nasymptomatic situations, the antrolith may be removed, sinus \nmembrane opening sealed, and sinus graft performed at the \nsame surgery.\nTREATMENT PLAN COMPLICATIONS\nNOT TAKING CBCT\nIn implant dentistry today, a thorough CBCT evaluation of \nthe paranasal sinuses should be completed before placement \nof implants in the posterior maxilla that violates the maxil-\nlary sinus. Of utmost importance is the evaluation and con-\nirmation of ostium patency. Many factors may preclude the \nsinus to ostium blockage, including pathology, anatomic vari-\nants, and foreign bodies. An implant clinician performing \nsinus augmentation procedures should become well versed in \nidentifying these occurrences during CBCT examination.\nComplication Prevention\nIf implant placement or bone graft procedures are indicated \nin the posterior maxilla that will violate the maxillary sinus \nproper, the superior limits of the CBCT should include the \nostium to verify patency. If the scan is limited in the superior \npositioning, ostium patency cannot be accurately ascertained. \nIf pathology is present, the scan will be useless for ENT evalu-\nation if the ostium evaluation is inadequate. This will most \nlikely necessitate a new scan ordered by the ENT.\nTREATMENT PLANNING AWAY  \nFROM AUGMENTATION\nMany doctors place themselves at risk when they treatment \nplan “away” from the maxillary sinus.

The third approach to the maxillary posterior edentu-\nlous region, SA-3, is indicated when a minimum of 5 mm of \nvertical bone and suficient width are present between the \nantral loor and the crest of the residual ridge. SA-3 sinus \naugmentation consists of utilizing the Tatum lateral maxillary \nwall approach and is performed superior to the residual alve-\nolar bone within the conines of the maxillary sinus. After the \nlateral-access window and membrane are rotated in and \nupward to a superior position, a mixture of autogenous bone \nand allograft (layered technique) material are placed in the \nspace previously occupied by the sinus. There are two types \nof sinus augmentation techniques, the SA-3I (immediate) \nand SA-3D (delayed) (Box 13.1).\nSA-4. In the fourth option for implant treatment of the pos-\nterior maxilla, SA-4, the SA region for future endosteal \nimplant insertion is irst augmented, allowed to heal, then \nimplants are placed at a later date. This option is indicated \nwhen less than 5 mm remains between the residual crest of \nbone and the loor of the maxillary sinus. The SA-4 corre-\nsponds to a larger sinus cavity along with less host bone on \nthe lateral, anterior, and distal regions of the graft because the \nantrum generally has expanded more aggressively into these \nregions. The inadequate vertical bone in these conditions \ndecreases the predictable placement of an implant (i.e., insuf-\nicient bone for initial implant ixation) at the same time as \nthe sinus graft, and less recipient bone exists to act as a vas-\ncular bed for the graft. Therefore, with fewer bony walls, a \nBecause the maxillary sinus is not violated and the physi-\nology is not changing during an SA-1 approach, it is less \ncritical to evaluate the sinus before implant insertion. The \ncontraindications for sinus graft surgery (e.g., maxillary sinus \npathology) do not apply for implant insertion when adequate \nbone is present below the sinus for implants of adequate size \nto support the load of the prosthesis. Although a common \naxiom in implant dentistry is to remain 2 mm or more from \nan opposing landmark, this is not necessary in the SA region.\nEndosteal implants in the SA-1 category are allowed to heal \nin a nonfunctional environment for approximately 4 to 8 \nmonths, which mainly is dependent on the bone density, type \nof bone graft material, and quantity of graft needed. Special \ncare should be utilized in preventing premature loading of \nthe implants in the posterior maxilla because of the poor bone \nquality. Therefore, the prosthetic interim prosthesis should be \nadjusted to prevent overloading. After healing, the prosthetic \nphase of treatment should include progressive loading, espe-\ncially if the bone present is D3 or D4.\nSA-2. The second SA option in the Misch SA classiication, \nSA-2, is selected when 10 to 12 mm of vertical bone is present \n(2 mm less than the minimum height in SA-1). To obtain the \n12 mm of vertical bone necessary for improved implant sur-\nvival (ideal implant length = 12 mm) in ridges of adequate \nwidth (division A), the antral loor is partially elevated through \nthe implant osteotomy. The SA-2 surgical approach elevates \nthe loor of the maxillary sinus from 0–2 mm. Even though the \nsinus loor is minimally altered, this will still change the physi-\nology mucociliary clearance within the maxillary sinus. A pre-\nexisting pathologic condition or nonpatent ostium of the sinus \nshould be addressed prior to implant placement because the \nimplant site may be subject to retrograde infection.\nThe endosteal implant osteotomy is prepared as deter-\nmined by the density of bone protocol, which is most com-\nmonly D3 bone. The depth of the osteotomy is prepared \napproximately 1 to 2 mm short of the inferior loor of the \nmaxillary sinus. When in doubt of the height dimension, the \nosteotomy should err on a shorter length to prevent the pos-\nsibility of membrane perforation. The implant osteotomy \nprocedure should be continued to the same depth (short of \nthe antral loor), until the inal width is obtained for implant \nplacement.\nA lat-end or cupped-shape osteotome of the same diam-\neter as the inal osteotomy is selected to infracture the loor \nof the sinus. Caution should be exercised when selecting the \nappropriate osteotomes as sinus osteotomes are a different \nshape than osteotomes used for bone spreading. The osteo-\ntome is inserted and tapped irmly into the osteotomy in \n0.5- to 1.0-mm increments beyond the initial depth before \nreaching its inal vertical position. This should not extend \nmore than 2 mm beyond the prepared implant osteotomy. A \nslow, careful elevation of the sinus loor is less likely to per-\nforate the sinus mucosa. Because this technique ends with a \ngreenstick-type of fracture, the unprepared bone and sinus \nmembrane over the broad-based osteotome will be elevated \nto form the new sinus loor.\nBOX 13.1 SA-3 Immediate Vs. SA-3 \nDelayed Technique\nImmediate Implant Placement (SA-3I)\nWhen the endosteal implants are inserted at the same time \nas the sinus graft, the following conditions should exist:\n• Greater than 5 mm bone height\n• Greater than 6 mm bone width\n• D3 bone quality or better\n• No sinus pathologic condition\n• No history of recurrent sinusitis\n• No relative contraindications\n• No or small sinus membrane tear during surgery, com-\npletely sealed with collagen\n• No parafunction on removable soft tissue-borne \nprosthesis\nDelayed Implant Placement (SA-3D)\nImplants should not be inserted at the same time as the sinus \ngraft when the following conditions exist:\n• Less than 6 mm bone width\n• D4 bone quality\n• Treated sinus pathologic condition within last few months\n• History of recurrent sinusitis (especially when treated \nwith recurrent antibiotic medications)\n• Relative contraindications (smoking, medically compro-\nmised patient)\n• Medium to large tear in the sinus membrane during the \ngraft surgery\n• Parafunction on overlying removable prosthesis"

This nerve inner-\nvates all maxillary teeth, gingival tissue, soft tissue of the \nmidface, nasal cavity, and maxillary sinuses, thus encompass-\ning the entire area of interest for sinus graft surgery.\nTechnique\nThe technique for achieving anesthesia to all of the above \nstructures with one injection is via the greater palatine canal. \nThe anesthetic needle is inserted through the greater palatine \nforamen and is advanced into the inferior portion of the \npterygopalatine fossa. To assist in locating the greater palatine \nforamen, an open-bore instrument (e.g., the rounded back \nend of a mouth mirror handle) can be used to mark the loca-\ntion over the foramen. Pressure is applied with this instru-\nment along the palatal tissue, at the union of the residual \nridge and hard palate, in the region of the second molar \n(approximately 1 cm lingual). The instrument will “fall into” \na concavity, which will mark the area over the foramen \nopening. A long, 112-inch needle is introduced into the \nforamen from the opposite side of the mouth and negotiates \nthe canal for approximately 1 inch (depending on length of \ncanal) as anesthetic is slowly administered (Fig. 13.25).\nComplication Implications\nIf improper needle positioning occurs, many complications \nmay arise. Errors in medial positioning can lead to nasal \nbleeding; a needle placed too superior can cause diplopia; \nincorrect posterior placement can cause coughing; incorrect \nplacement also results in insuficient anesthesia at the surgical \nsite. Care should be made to prevent intravascular injections \n(aspiration), which may lead to systemic effects and possible \nhematoma formation.\nINCORRECT WINDOW  \nOSTEOTOMY LOCATION\nThe overall design of the lateral-access window is determined \nafter the review of the CBCT scan, which helps determine the \nthickness of the lateral wall of the antrum, the position of the \nantral loor from the crest of the ridge, the location of teeth, \nas well as the presence of septa on the loor and/or walls of \nthe sinus. The main goal of window design and location is \nthat the graft MUST encompass the area in which future \nimplants will be placed.\nLack of Grafting Area\nIf the outline of the window is not ideal, the inal location of \nthe graft material will not encompass the area needed for \nfuture implant placement. Implant placement will result in \nvoids and lack of bone surrounding the implants. This may \nlead to inadequate integration, loss of implants, or migration \nof implants into the sinus proper.\nOsteotomy Window Made Over Host Bone\nIf the window location and osteotomy is not made within the \nconines of the sinus proper, the lateral window will not be \nable to be infractured. Therefore, osteotomy preparation over \nless favorable vascular bed, minimal local autologous bone, \nand larger graft volume, a longer healing period is mandated \nwith a slightly altered surgical approach.\nSYSTEMIC ISSUES: SMOKING\nSmoking is known to be associated with an increased suscep-\ntibility to allergy and infections because it interferes with the \nciliary function and secretory immunity of the nasorespira-\ntory tract. In the maxillary sinus, this may have effects on both \nimmune exclusion and suppression because IgA and IgM \nresponses are reduced, whereas IgE responses are increased. \nSmoking is believed to disturb bone graft healing because it \nreduces local blood low by increasing peripheral resistance \nand by causing increased platelet aggregation.42 By-product \nchemicals of smoking, such as hydrogen cyanide and carbon \nmonoxide, have been shown to inhibit wound healing, as does \nnicotine, which inhibits cellular proliferation. Tobacco may \ninterfere directly with osteoblastic function, and strong evi-\ndence exists of decreased bone formation in smokers. In addi-\ntion, smokers have a signiicant reduction of bone mineral \ncontent. Bone mineral density can be reduced two to six times \nin a chronic smoker. Overall, smoking may contribute to poor \navailable bone quality and poor healing capacity resulting \nfrom vascular and osteoblastic dysfunction.\nSmoking is a relative risk factor and has been linked to \nreduced implant survival outcomes. In an 8-year follow-up \nstudy of 13,147 implants placed in 4316 patients, Busenlech-\nner and colleagues43 found a threefold failure rate increase in \nsmokers compared with nonsmokers. In a recent systematic \nreview, Pjetursson and colleagues found there was almost \ntwice the rate of implant failures in smokers as compared \nwith nonsmokers.44\nTreatment Implications\nSmoking may represent a relative contraindication because of \nthe risk of wound dehiscence, graft infection and/or resorp-\ntion, and a reduced probability of osseointegration. It is rec-\nommended, however, that if a decision to proceed with \nsurgery has been made, that patients refrain from smoking at \nleast 14 days before surgery (the time it takes for nicotine to \nbe cleared systemically) and 4 to 6 weeks after surgery. Patients \nmay be referred to their primary physician for the implemen-\ntation of a smoking cessation program. Moreover, smokers \nshould sign a detailed informed-consent form (both verbally \nand written) in which risks connected to smoking are clearly \nexplained (See Smoking Cessation Techniques in Chapter 2).\nINTRAOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS\nINADEQUATE ANESTHESIA: V2 BLOCK\nIn sinus graft surgery, it is advantageous to anesthetize all \nstructures in the general area for the comfort of the patient \nand hemostasis.

The inferior score line of the rectangular access \nwindow on the lateral maxilla is placed approximately \n1–2 mm above the level of the antral loor. If the inferior score \nline is made at or below the level of the antral loor, infracture \nof the lateral wall will be very dificult, leading to possible \nmembrane perforation. If the inferior score line is made too \nhigh (>5 mm) above the sinus loor, a ledge above the sinus \nloor will result in a blind dissection of the membrane on the \nloor. This will lead to a higher incidence of membrane per-\nforation. The inferior osteotomy should follow the outline of \nthe maxillary sinus inferior border (Fig. 13.28B).\nSuperior. The most superior aspect of the lateral-access \nwindow should be approximately 15 mm superior to the \nalveolar crest. This will allow a buffer zone of 3 mm, as the \nideal length of an implant placed in a sinus graft is 12 mm. \nA soft tissue retractor (Seldin) placed above the superior \nmargin of the lateral-access window helps retract the facial \nlap and prevents the retractor’s inadvertent slip into the \naccess window, which may damage the underlying membrane \nof the sinus. The superior score line should always be parallel \nto the alveolar crest (Fig. 13.28B).\nAnterior. The anterior vertical line of the access window is \nscored approximately 2–3 mm distal to the anterior vertical \nwall of the antrum. If the sinus access window outline is dif-\nicult to determine in relation to the sinus cavity, it should err \nover the antrum rather than over the bone around this struc-\nture. Additionally, the anterior wall should always be identi-\nied to minimize a void in the area of future implant \nplacement. If the membrane is not released from the anterior \nwall, an anterior defect may result. If a defect results, remedia-\ntion in this area is very dificult with a high degree of \nmorbidity.\nWhen teeth are present anteriorly, they made be used to \ndetermine the exact location of the anterior vertical osteot-\nomy location (Fig. 13.28A).\nPosterior. If the window location is not extended far enough \nposterior, future implant placement may result in inadequate \nbone ill, leading to remediation or change of implant site \nlocation to a less favorable location. The posterior score line \nshould extend approximately 5 mm distal to the last implant \nbeing proposed.

Additionally, the extent of tuberosity removal \nused for donor bone should be determined in relation to \nthe most distal implant site. The tuberosity harvest, if made \ntoo close to the implant site, may compromise placement \n(Fig. 13.28E).\nAGGRESSIVE OSTEOTOMY PREPARATION\nThe osteotomy window should be prepared with either a #6 \nor #8 carbide or diamond bur, or with a Piezosurgery unit. \nCare must be taken to slowly score the outline of the oste-\notomy window while looking for the appearance of the \nhost bone will not allow access to the sinus cavity and mem-\nbrane (Figs. 13.26 and 13.27). This results in extended surgi-\ncal time and removal of valuable host bone needed for initial \nimplant stability (e.g., inferior border).\nDamage to Existing Tooth Root\nCaution should be exercised to make the window at least 2 \nmillimeters from any adjacent tooth root and within the sinus \nproper. Encroaching on a tooth root may devitalize the tooth, \nleading to possible endodontic treatment or internal/external \nresorption. It is not uncommon for this to occur with dilac-\nerations or multiple-rooted premolar teeth (see Fig. 13.27C).\nPrevention\nTo ensure ideal bone grafting placement, an ideal window \noutline must be performed.\nFIG 13.25 (A) Greater palatine foramen.

The maximum length requirement of an implant \nwith adequate surface of design is rarely more than 12 mm, \nand as a result the goal of the initial sinus graft is to obtain \nat least 12 mm of vertical bone from the crest of the ridge. \nThis usually requires the bottom one half to one third of the \nsinus to be illed with graft material because most sinuses \napproximate 35 mm in height. A CBCT scan (i.e., and inter-\nactive treatment planning) of the sinus prior to surgery may \nbe used to estimate the amount of graft material required for \nthe ideal volume of sinus graft material. The average volume \nof the maxillary sinus is approximately 15 ml.45 Care should \nbe noted to the amount of graft material placed into the sinus.\nComplication\nOverilling the sinus can result in blockage of the ostium, \nespecially if membrane inlammation or the presence of a \nthickened sinus mucosa exists.

Perfo-\nrating the membrane complicates the procedure and increases \nthe morbidity (Fig. 13.29A–B).\nPrevention\nTo prevent overpreparation of the osteotomy, the implant \nclinician should select the ideal instrumentation for proce-\ndure. Usually, clinicians early on their learning curve \nshould utilize a piezotome unit for osteotomy preparation. \nThis technique has the least possibility of perforating the \nsinus membrane.

This situation may result in a \nsoft tissue interface with the implant and a decreased likeli-\nhood of success may result.\nPrevention\nWhen grafting after elevation of the membrane, a sinus \nsyringe (or 1- or 3-ml syringe) may be used to introduce the \nmaterial into the sinus. The material should be introduced in \nan inferior-anterior angulation in small increments (most \ndistant irst). This will ensure the graft material is introduced \nto all relected areas.

The lateral wall should be grafted to at least the \noriginal contour. If not, a defect will result in tissue invagina-\ntion, which increases morbidity and possible infection. This \nis why a membrane is placed over the lateral wall after sinus \ngraft augmentation: to minimize loss of graft material and \nosseous regeneration to the original bony contour (Fig. 13.31).\nAGGRESSIVE TUBEROSITY REMOVAL\nThe tuberosity is a common donor site to be used as a source \nof autogenous bone with the layering technique of bone \ngrafting. The use of autogenous bone allows for more pre-\ndictable bone growth and decreases healing time. The addi-\ntion of an autogenous component in sinus grafting is most \nimportant when a lack of suficient host bone is present \n(SA-4) because the less host bone there is, the less blood will \nbe supplied to the region for healing. Tuberosity bone is ideal \nfor sinus grafting because the cancellous nature of this bone \nallows it to be moldable with less chance to migrate.\nTreatment Implications\nCorrect Location. The thicker soft tissue in the tuberosity \nregion can mislead the assessment of this donor site. The \ntuberosity area should be evaluated with a CBCT examina-\ntion, most easily measured on the coronal or panoramic \nimage. The anatomic limits of this area include the maxillary \nsinus, pterygoid plates, adjacent teeth when present, and the"

It extends anteriorly across \nthe tuberosity into the molar region. After relection of a \nmucoperiosteal lap, bone may be harvested from the tuber-\nosity with a rongeur, chisel, or trephine drill.\nExposure of Posterior Sinus Cavity. Care should be used \nto not inadvertently expose the posterior sinus cavity because \nof excessive bone removal. This may lead to oroantral com-\nmunication and possibly an opening for bacterial contamina-\ntion, which may increase the morbidity of the graft area.\nHarvest Too Far Posterior. Harvesting the tuberosity too far \nposterior may lead to potential bleeding issues. This aggres-\nsive harvest may result in hemorrhage from the tributary \nvessels of the pterygoid plexus, such as the deep facial vein \nor posterior superior alveolar vessels. This can result in bleed-\ning into the pterygomaxillary and infratemporal spaces, \nwhich may result in a hematoma via the inferior orbital \nissure (Fig. 13.32).46\nSA-2 (OSTEOTOME TECHNIQUE) \nCOMPLICATIONS\nThe SA-2 approach (also termed transalveolar approach, \nosteotome sinus loor elevation, Summers technique, or the \nCrestal approach) may be considered a more conservative and \nless invasive sinus grafting technique (Fig. 33.33). This pro-\ncedure is performed through the alveolar crest of the eden-\ntulous ridge at the inferior border of the maxillary sinus. It \ninvolves elevating the sinus membrane, creating a “tent” and \nproviding space for graft placement. The membrane is ele-\nvated and the area is grafted blindly, with the disadvantage of \nan uncertainty of possible perforations of the sinus loor \n(Schneiderian) membrane. The following are complications \nof this technique.\nPatient Selection: Inadequate Bone\nIt is recommended that at least 10 mm of host bone be present \nbelow the sinus for this technique. If inadequate height and \nwidth of bone is present, rigid ixation is compromised, and \nthe implant may become mobile and possibly migrate into \nthe sinus proper. Additionally, an oblique sinus loor, septa, \npathology, or nonpatent ostium may increase possible mor-\nbidity or may contraindicate the osteotome technique.\nOverpreparation of Osteotomy\nBecause of the poor bone quality present in the posterior \nmaxilla (D4 Bone), D4 type of bone, inadequate bone \nstrength, along with lack of cortical bone, alters the initial \nprimary stability. Lack of stability leads to possible migration \nor displacement of the implant into the maxillary sinus or \nsurrounding areas.\nSinus Membrane Perforation\nBecause of the closed nature of this technique, perforation of \nthe membrane is usually impossible to determine (i.e., unless \na postoperative CBCT examination is performed). Because of \nirregular antral loors, septa, adhesions, and pathology, tears \nin the membrane are deinitely more frequent than what \nmost report. Perforation leads to possible infection and mor-\nbidity of the graft and implant.\nAccess\nBecause of compromised interocclusal space, in some patients, \nclosed sinus graft procedures may be problematic because of \naccess problems. To make the surgery easier, bite blocks along \nwith the use of off-angle osteotomes may be used. Patient \nopening for a long period of time may lead to muscle trismus \nor complications within the temporomandibular joint (TMJ).\nUse of Incorrect Osteotomes\nThe use of straight osteotomes is not ideal because specially \nmade (maxillary posterior) offset osteotomes are designed to \nbe more user-friendly and work more eficiently. The use of \npiezoelectric osteotomy preparation allows for a more con-\ntrolled osteotomy with low perforation risk (Fig. 13.33).\nFinal Osteotome Should Only Be Used Once\nEntering the osteotomy multiple times leads to increasing the \ndiameter of the osteotomy and causing decreased primary \nstability. Usually, undersizing the osteotomy allows for better \nixation along with increasing the amount of bone present at \nthe implant interface. Poor bone quality (e.g., D4) can be \nchanged to a D3 or D2 via the osteotome technique.\nGraft With Small Increments of Material\nGrafting too much material at once will prevent the place-\nment of the implant into the osteotomy to full length. Ideally, \nno more than 0.2 cc of bone should be placed at once, neces-\nsitating multiple osteotome grafting techniques.\nBenign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo\nBenign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) has been \nshown to have a direct correlation with osteotome sinus loor \nelevation.47 Studies have shown this postoperative complica-\ntion to be relatively high at 3%.48 From the pounding and \nrepeated force from the osteotomes, calcium carbonate crys-\ntals are dislodged and settle in on the cupula of the semicir-\ncular canal (cupulolithiasis). They strike nerve endings in the \nsemicircular canals, which produces position- or motion-\ninduced vertigo.49\nDiagnosis. The symptoms associated with BPPV include \nvertigo and nausea, which are precipitated by positional \nchanges of the head. This disorder may resolve in days or may \nprolong for months.\nManagement. Many treatments have been proposed for the \ntreatment of BPPV including drugs, surgery, and vestibular \nrehabilitation exercises. However, one of most common and \npredictable procedures is the Epley procedure, which is \nusually performed by an ENT physician.

In general, the more narrow the sinus, the \nmore dificult the graft process and the greater the chance of \nperforation. Usually the narrowest part of the sinus is in the \nanterior region; however, some sinuses are inherently small in \na buccal-lingual dimension. To prevent perforation, the lateral \nwall may be removed to minimize trauma to the membrane.\nOsteotomy Line Angles. The corners of the access window \nshould always be rounded, rather than at right or acute angles. \nIf the corner angles are too sharp, membrane perforation may \noccur when elevating the window. Additionally, the osteot-\nomy cuts should be deep enough that the window is free, \nprior to elevation of the membrane.\nThickness of Membrane. On average the Schneiderian \nmembrane is approximately 1.0 mm in thickness.

On a CBCT scan, the thickness of the membrane will \nbe depicted as varying levels of grey around the periphery of \nthe sinus. In health the membrane will not be seen on a CBCT \nscan. Studies have shown that membranes less than 1.5 mm \nin thickness have a 31% perforation rate in comparison to \nthicker membranes with a rate of 16.6%.51 Additional studies \nshow a direct relationship between thicker periodontal bio-\ntypes and increased membrane thickness, which lead to a \ndecreased perforation rate.52\nKeep Curette on Bony Floor.

They must take all prophylactic \nmedications as prescribed and be warned of possible bleeding/\ngraft material through the nostril within the irst 24 hours.\nAbort Implant Placement in SA-3I Patients. When a sinus \nmembrane perforation has occurred during a SA-3 immedi-\nate (sinus graft + implant placement) approach, it is prudent \nto delay implant insertion. Placement of implants is deferred \nfor at least 2 months (in an SA-3 option) to allow for healing \nof the membrane and the gingival tissues on the edentulous \ncrest. Risks of the sinus graft entering the sinus proper \nincrease when implants are inserted into the grafted site. The \nwaiting period before implant insertion permits assessment \nof postsurgical complications and graft consolidation before \nthe implants are inserted.\nANTRAL SEPTA\nAntral septa (buttresses, webs, and struts) are the most \ncommon osseous anatomic variants present in the maxillary \nsinus. Underwood, an anatomist, irst described maxillary \nsinus septa in 1910, and these bony variants are sometimes \ncalled Underwood septa. Septa vary in location, orientation, \nnumber, size, and thickness, and may inluence the position-\ning of dental implants in the posterior maxilla. They compli-\ncate the creation of the lateral window along with relection \nof the membrane. The presence of antral septa has been \nreported to increase the risk of membrane perforation sig-\nniicantly.53 The presence of septa, along with the determina-\ntion of their location and orientation, is most easily seen via \na CBCT survey. Evaluation of the 3-D or cross-sectional \nimages give the clinician the most accurate information.\nEtiology\nUnderwood postulated the etiology of these bony projections \nderived from three different periods of tooth development \nand eruption. Krennmair et al54 further classiied these struc-\ntures into two groups: primary, which are a result of the \ndevelopment of the maxilla, and secondary, which arise from \nthe pneumatization of the sinus loor after tooth loss.\nThe septa may be complete or incomplete on the loor, \ndepending on whether they divide the bottom of the sinus \ninto compartments. The shape of an incomplete maxillary \nsinus septum often resembles an inverted gothic arch that \narises from the inferior or lateral walls of the sinus. In rare \ninstances, they may divide the sinus into two compartments \nthat radiate from the medial wall toward the lateral wall.\nThe most common location of septa in the maxillary sinus \nhas been reported to be in the middle (second bicuspid–irst \nmolar) region of the sinus cavity. CT scan studies have shown \nthat 41% of septa are seen in the middle region, 35% in the \nposterior region, and 24% in the anterior region.\nComplication\nSinus septa may create added dificulty at the time of surgery. \nMaxillary sinus septa can prevent adequate access and \nTreatment\nAlter Surgery Technique. Once the tear or perforation is \nidentiied, the continuation of the sinus elevation procedure \nis modiied. The sinus membrane should be elevated off all \nthe bony walls of the antrum, despite the mucosal tear. If a \nportion of the membrane is not elevated away from a sinus \nwall, the graft material will be placed on top of the mem-\nbrane, preventing the bone graft from incorporating with the \nbony wall. The perforation of the sinus membrane should be \nsealed to prevent contamination of the graft from mucus and \ncontents of the sinus proper while preventing the graft mate-\nrial from extruding into the sinus proper.\nSmall Perforation. The surgical correction of a perforation \nis initiated by elevating the sinus mucosal regions distal from \nthe opening. Once the tissues are elevated away from the \nopening, the membrane elevation with a sinus curette should \napproach the tear from all sides so that the torn region may \nbe elevated without increasing the opening size. The antral \nmembrane elevation technique decreases the overall size of \nthe antrum, “folding” the membrane over on itself and result-\ning in closure of the perforation. A piece of resorbable col-\nlagen membrane (e.g., CollaTape [Zimmer Dental Inc.]) is \nplaced over the opening to ensure continuity of the sinus \nmucosa before the sinus bone graft is placed. The collagen \nadheres to the membrane and seals the SA space from the \nsinus proper (Fig. 13.35).\nLarge Perforation. If the sinus membrane tear is larger than \n6 mm and cannot be closed off with the circumelevation \napproach, a resorbable collagen membrane of a longer resorp-\ntion cycle (BioMend Extend— ~4 months) may be used to \nseal the opening. The remaining sinus mucosa is irst elevated \nas described previously. A piece of collagen matrix is cut to \ncover the sinus tear opening and overlap the margins more \nthan 5 mm. Once the opening is sealed, the sinus graft pro-\ncedure may be completed in routine fashion. However, care \nshould be exercised when packing the sinus with graft mate-\nrial. After a perforation, the graft is easily pushed through the \ncollagen-sealed opening and into the sinus proper, so a peri-\nosteal elevator may be placed at the top of the graft site and \nunder the perforation. The graft material is then gently \ninserted and pushed toward the sinus loor and sides but not \ntoward the top of the graft (Figs. 13.36 and 13.37).\nLocal Antibiotic. A greater bacterial risk of penetration into \nthe graft material exists through the torn membrane. It is \nimperative that local antibiotic (pure form) be added to the \nparticulate graft material. In addition, mucous may invade \nthe graft and affect the amount of bone formation. Graft \nmaterial may leak through the tear into the sinus proper, \nmigrate to and through the ostium, and be eliminated \nthrough the nose or obstruct the ostium, preventing or alter-\ning normal sinus drainage.\nMonitor Postoperatively.

The most common site (90%) of nasal \nbleeding is from a plexus of vessels at the anteroinferior \naspect of the nasal septum and the anterior nasal cavity \n(which is anterior to the sinus cavity and within the anterior \nprojection of the nose). The posterior nasal cavity accounts \nfor 5% to 10% of epistaxis events and is in the region of the \nsinus graft. If the medial wall of the sinus is perforated, a \ncurette may enter the nares and cause bleeding.\nEXCESS PRESSURE ON GRAFT SITE\nThe stabilization of the sinus graft material is paramount to \npredictable bone growth because it ensures blood clot adhe-\nsion and the associated growth factors for predictable healing. \nimplant placement may engage this dense bone, allowing for \nstrong intermediate ixation. Moreover, septa allow for faster \nbone formation because they act as an additional wall of bone \nfor blood vessels to grow into the graft.\nManagement\nThe modiication to the surgery is variable depending on its \nlocation. The septum may be in the anterior, middle, or distal \ncompartment of the antrum.\nAnterior. When the septum is found in the anterior section, \nthe lateral-access window is divided into sections: one in front \nof the septa and another distal to the structure. This permits \nthe release of each section of the lateral wall after tapping with \na blunt instrument. The elevation of each released section \npermits access into the exact location of the septum to con-\ntinue the mucosal elevation. The window (lateral wall) may \nalso be removed to prevent trauma to the membrane.\nThe mucosal tissue may often be elevated from the lateral \nwalls above the septum. The curette may then slide down the \nside walls and release the mucosa from the bottom half of the \nseptum on each side. The sinus curette should then approach \nthe crest of the buttress from both directions, up to its sharp \napex. This permits elevation of the tissue over the web region \nwithout tearing the membrane (Fig. 13.38).\nMiddle. When the septum is located in the middle region of \nthe sinus, it is more dificult to make two separate access \nwindows within the direct vision of the surgeon. As a result, \none access window is made in front of the septum. The sinus \ncurette then proceeds up the anterior aspect of the web, \ntoward its apex. The curette then slides toward the lateral wall \nand above the septum’s apex. The curette may then slide over \nthe crest of the septum approximately 1 to 2 mm. A irm, \npulling action fractures the apex of the septum. Repeated \nsimilar curette actions can fracture the web off the loor. Once \nthe septum is separated off the loor, the curette may proceed \nmore distal along the loor and walls (Fig. 13.39).\nPosterior. When the septum is in the posterior compart-\nment of the sinus, it is often distal to the last implant site. \nWhen this occurs, the posterior septum is treated as the pos-\nterior wall of the sinus, containing the graft material. The \nsinus membrane manipulation and sinus graft is placed up \nagainst and anterior to the posterior septum (Fig. 13.40).\nBLEEDING\nBleeding from the lateral-approach sinus elevation surgery has \nthe potential to be problematic. Three main arterial vessels \nshould be of concern with the lateral-approach sinus augmen-\ntation. During this surgery, there exist multiple arteries which \nmay cause an increase in bleeding issues (see Chapter 7).\nExtraosseous Anastomosis\nThe soft tissue vertical-release incisions of the facial lap in a \nresorbed maxilla may sever the extraosseous anastomoses."

    "content": "540\nCHAPTER 13 Posterior Maxilla Complications\nPOSTOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS\nNERVE IMPAIRMENT\nThe infraorbital nerve is of concern in sinus elevation surgery \nbecause of its anatomic position. This nerve enters the orbit \nvia the inferior orbital issure and continues anteriorly. It lies \nin a groove in the orbital loor (which is also the maxillary \nsinus superior wall) before exiting the infraorbital foramen. \nThe infraorbital nerve exits the foramen approximately 6.1 to \n7.2 mm from the orbital rim.\nIt is of note that anatomic variants have been reported to \ninclude dehiscence and malpositioned infraorbital foramina, \nalong with the nerve transversing the lumen of the maxillary \nsinus rather than coursing through the bone within the sinus \nceiling (orbital loor). Malpositioned nerves have been \nreported as far as 14 mm from the orbital rim in some indi-\nviduals. In the severely atrophic maxilla, the infraorbital neu-\nrovascular structures exiting the foramen may be close to the \nintraoral residual ridge and should be avoided when per-\nforming sinus graft procedures to minimize possible nerve \nimpairment. This is of particular concern on soft tissue \nrelection and the bone preparation of the superior aspect of \nthe window. Special considerations should be taken during \nrelection of the superior lap and sharp-ended retractors \nshould be avoided. Usually, those most at risk have a small \ncranial base (i.e., elderly females).\nComplication\nBecause the infraorbital nerve is responsible for sensory \ninnervations to the skin of the molar region between the \ninferior border of the orbit and the upper lip, iatrogenic \ninjury to this vital structure can result in signiicant neuro-\nsensory deicits of this anatomic area. Most often the nerve is \nnot severed, and a neuropraxia results. Even though this \ninjury is sensory and there is no motor deicit, patients usually \nhave a dificult time adapting to this neurosensory impair-\nment (Fig. 13.42).\nFIG 13.40 (A) A maxillary septum found on the loor in the posterior of the sinus.

Failed \nor compromised sinus grafts result in altered soft and hard \ntissue characteristics, mainly the formation of adhesions of \nthe Schneiderian membrane to the buccal lap. This results in \ndificulty with relecting the buccal lap during the reentry \nprocedure. Studies have shown that separation of the adhe-\nsions from the sinus mucosa led to a 47% perforation rate.\nIn addition, it has been shown that altered characteristics \nof the Schneiderian membrane result in a nonlexible thick \nibrotic membrane. In some cases, where voids are present \nbut have dificult access, regrafting procedures may need to \nbe accomplished via a closed approach through the osteot-\nomy site.56\nTreatment Implications\nBecause of access issues, along with the higher perforation rate \nand ibrotic changes in the Schneiderian membrane, patients \nneed to be informed of a higher postoperative complication \nrate involving questionable reentry bone growth and implant \nsuccess. If reentry is necessary, usually bony adhesions and \nbony fenestrations of the lateral walls will be present.\nThe combination of ibrotic changes of the Schneiderian \nmembrane, increased chance of perforation, and altered sinus \nphysiology lead to a high complication rate. The continuation \nof the sinus mucosa and oral mucosa make reentry revision \nsurgery problematic and dificult (Fig. 13.43). This will \nrequire the separation of the oral and sinus mucosa to gain \naccess to the sinus proper.\nEDEMA\nBecause of the extent of tissue relection and manipulation, \nsinus graft surgery often results in signiicant edema. The \nresultant postoperative swelling can adversely affect the inci-\nsion line, leading to greater morbidity.\nPrevention\nThe use of good surgical technique that involves careful \nrelection and retraction will decrease the amount of postop-\nerative edema.\nMinimize Surgical Duration. The greater the surgery dura-\ntion, the greater the chance of edema. Caution should be \nnoted to decrease the amount of surgical duration and should \nnot exceed the patient’s tolerance.\nCorticosteroid Treatment. To minimize edema, corticoste-\nroid use is utilized 1 day prior to and 2 days after surgery."

This cryotherapy will \ncause vasoconstriction of the capillary vessels, reducing the \nlow of blood and lymph and resulting in a lower degree of \nswelling. Ice or cold dressings should only be used for the irst \n24 to 48 hours. After 2 to 3 days, heat (moist) may be applied \nto the region to increase blood and lymph low to help clear \nthe area of the inlammatory consequences. This will also \nhelp reduce the possibility of ecchymosis that may result.\nECCHYMOSIS\nSinus graft surgery also increases the possibility of bruising \nor ecchymosis. Because of the extent of relection, bone prep-\naration, and the highly vascular surgical area, ecchymosis will \noccur more often with this procedure in comparison to other \nimplant related surgeries.\nEtiology\nThe etiology of ecchymosis includes the following: blood \nvessels rupture → red blood cells die and release hemoglobin \n→ macrophages degrade hemoglobin via phagocytosis → \nproduction of bilirubin (bluish-red) → bilirubin is broken \ndown to hemosiderin (golden-brown).\nPrevention\nIn most cases, ecchymosis will not be able to be completely \nprevented; however, the goal should be to minimize the extent \nof bruising. Additionally, good surgical technique, shorter \nsurgical duration, the avoidance of anticoagulant analgesics, \nand postoperative cryotherapy all aid in the control of this \nphenomenon (Fig. 13.44). Patients should always be informed \nof the possibility of ecchymosis. This is easily accomplished \nby having it be part of the postoperative instructions.\nPAIN\nMinimal discomfort and pain is usually associated with sinus \ngraft surgery. However, if narcotics are indicated, any analge-\nsic combination containing codeine, such as Tylenol 3, is \nprescribed postoperatively because codeine is a potent anti-\ntussive, and coughing may place additional pressure on the \nsinus membrane and introduce bacteria into the graft. The \npatient is instructed to cough (if necessary) with the mouth \nopen to minimize possible air pressure changes within the \nsinus cavity.\nNASAL BLEEDING\nEpistaxis (active bleeding from the nose) is a common com-\nplication following sinus elevation surgery, especially when a \nmembrane perforation has been noted. Usually, this occurs \nwithin the irst 24 hours after surgery.\nTreatment\nTreatment options to treat epistaxis include nasal packing, \nelectrocautery, and the use of vasoconstrictive drugs.

If incision line opening includes a \nportion of a nonresorbable membrane (e.g., for lateral-ridge \naugmentation), the membrane should be cleaned at least \ntwice daily with an abrasive device and oral rinses of chlorhex-\nidine. If the incision line is not closed after 2 months, a surgi-\ncal procedure should reenter the site, expand the tissues, \nremove the bone regeneration membrane, and reapproximate \nthe tissue.\nOROANTRAL FISTULAE\nOroantral istulae may develop postoperatively, especially if \nthe patient has a history of past sinus pathology or infection. \nSmall oroantral istulae (<5 mm) usually will close spontane-\nously after treatment with systemic antibiotic drugs and daily \nrinses with chlorhexidine. However, larger istulae (>5 mm) \nwill normally require additional surgical intervention \n(Fig. 13.45). Larger istulae are associated with an epithelial-\nized tract, which is the result of the fusion of the sinus mem-\nbrane mucosa to the oral epithelium. When this occurs, \npatients will most likely complain of luids entering the nasal \ncavity upon eating or drinking. Caution should be exercised \nin using the nose blowing test to conirm the presence of a \noral-antral istula. The patient is asked to pinch their nostrils \ntogether to occlude the nose. The patient blows gently to see \nif air escapes into the oral cavity via the sinus. This is not \nrecommended as this test may create an opening or make a \nsmall opening larger.\nManagement\nClosure of oroantral istulae can be accomplished by using \nbroad-based lingual or facially rotated laps (Figs. 13.46 and \n13.47). Buccal laps to close the istula may be more dificult \nafter a sinus graft because of the location of the graft site. In \naddition, the buccal tissue is very thin, and rotated or \nexpanded buccal laps usually result in loss of vestibular \ndepth. Before the initiation of the lap design, the soft tissue \naround the istula is excised and the sinus loor curetted to \nensure direct bone contact. A tension-free rotated lap is then \nafter the surgery. After 5 minutes the dental loss is gently \npulled to remove the cotton roll. The head is also elevated, \nand ice is applied to the bridge of the nose. If bleeding cannot \nbe controlled, reentry into the graft site and endoscopic liga-\ntion by an ENT surgeon may be required.\nINCISION LINE OPENING\nIncision line opening is uncommon for this procedure \nbecause the crestal incision is most likely in attached gingiva \nand is usually at least 5 mm away from the lateral-access \nwindow. Routinely, the soft tissue requires release before \nprimary approximation and suturing. Incision line opening \noccurs more commonly when lateral-ridge augmentation is \nperformed at the same time as sinus graft surgery or when \nimplants are placed above the residual crest and covered with \nthe soft tissue. It may also occur when a soft tissue–supported \nprosthesis compresses the surgical area during function \nbefore suture removal.\nComplication\nThe consequences of incision line opening are delayed \nhealing, contamination of the graft, and increased risk of \ninfection. However, if the incision line failure is not related \nto a lateral augmentation graft and is only on the crest of the \nridge and away from the sinus access window, the posterior \ncrestal area is allowed to heal by secondary intention.\nPrevention\nUsually, when a collagen membrane is placed over the window, \nthe soft tissue will not approximate without tension release \nwith the surgeon expanding the facial lap by releasing the \nperiosteum above the mucogingival junction (where the \ntissue becomes thicker). It is imperative that tension-free \nclosure be completed.\nManagement\nIf incision line opening occurs, the soft tissue–borne restora-\ntion should be aggressively relieved, with no reline material \nFIG 13.44 Ecchymosis.

Bacterial resis-\ntance is initiated by two common mechanisms: (1) produc-\ntion of antibiotic-inactivating enzymes (S. aureus, H. \ninluenzae, and M. catarrhalis) and (2) alteration in target site \n(S. pneumoniae). Studies have shown the following resistance \nresults60:\nH. inluenzae: 36.8%\nM. catarrhalis: 98%\nS. pneumoniae: 28.6%\nIdeal antibiotic. Because of the high rate of bacterial \nresistance, amoxicillin (the drug of choice for many years) is \nno longer used for antibiotic prophylaxis for the sinus graft \nsurgery. Instead, amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin) is rec-\nommended because of the addition of clavulanic acid, which \nenhances amoxicillin’s activity against the beta-lactamase–\nproducing strains of bacteria. The clavulanate acid, which is \nalso an antibiotic, has an afinity to the beta-lactamase. \nBecause of this interaction, the beta-lactamase is inactivated. \nAdditionally, Augmentin has a very good, broad spectrum of \nbacteria that may cause oral infections.\nAlternative antibiotics. The patient with a history of \nnonanaphylactic allergic reaction to penicillin may take cefu-\nroxime axetil (Ceftin), which is a second-generation cephalo-\nsporin, as an alternative.61 Ceftin possesses good potency, \neficiency, and strong activity against resistant S. pneumoniae \nand H. inluenzae bacteria.\nIf a patient has a history of an anaphylactic reaction to \npenicillin, recurrent sinus infections, or a recent history of \nantibiotic use, levoloxacin (Levaquin) may be indicated. This \nnewer type of quinolone antibiotic exhibits superior activity \nagainst most types of involved bacteria, along with resistant \nstrains.\nEarly administration. Maximum effectiveness of pro-\nphylactic antibiotic drugs occurs when the antibiotic is in \nadequate concentrations in the tissue prior to bacterial inva-\nsion. Because the sinus mucosa has limited blood supply to \ncombat possible bacterial invasion from the sinus surgery, \nalong with a high incidence of tissue inlammation, antibiotic \nmedications should be administered at least 1 full day before \nsurgery and extended for 5 days after surgery.\nLocal antibiotic medications. The antibiotic concentra-\ntion within a blood clot of the sinus graft depends on the \nsystemic blood titer. After the clot stabilizes, further antibiotic \ndrugs do not enter the area until revascularization.62 The \nbone graft is a dead space with minimum blood supply \nand the absence of protection by the host’s cellular defense \nmechanisms. This leaves the graft prone to infections \nthat would normally be eliminated by either the host defenses \nor the antibiotic. The osteogenic induction of autografts \nand allografts is greatly retarded when contaminated with"

Because infection con-\nsiderably impairs bone formation for patients undergoing \nsinus graft procedures, oral antibiotic coverage is continued \nfor 5 days after the surgery.\nOral antimicrobial rinse. An additional antimicrobial \nmedication that is recommended is chlorhexidine gluconate. \nThis category of mouth rinse has been shown to successfully \ndecrease infectious episodes and minimizes postoperative \ncomplications from the incision line. Gentle oral rinses of \nchlorhexidine gluconate 0.12% should be used twice daily for \n2 weeks after surgery.\nGlucocorticoid medications. The decrease in inlamma-\ntion of the soft tissue decreases postoperative pain, swelling, \nand incision line opening. In addition, the clinical manifesta-\ntions of surgery on the sinus mucosa can also be decreased \nby use of a steroid.66 The usual surgical protocol for \nmost implant surgeries, including sinus grafts, includes a \ninfectious bacteria.63 To ensure adequate antibiotic levels in a \nSA graft, it is recommended to add antibiotic (e.g., pure \nform) to the graft mixture.64 The local antibiotic may protect \nthe graft from early contamination and infection. Numerous \nstudies have shown that an antibiotic added to graft material \nhas no deleterious effects on bone growth. Antibiotic drugs \nsuch as penicillin, cephalosporin, and clindamycin, even in \nhigh concentrations, have not been found to be destructive \nto bone-inductive proteins.65\nThe locally delivered antibiotic should have eficacy against \nthe most likely organisms encountered. Because the incidence \nof allergy is so high with beta-lactam antibiotic drugs, the \nparenteral form of cefazolin (Ancef) or clindamycin is \nselected. Orally administered capsules and tablets should not \nbe used within the graft because they contain illers that are \nnot conducive to osteogenesis. When the parenteral form of \nantibiotic is a liquid, the volume of liquid added to the \ngraft should be minimized to allow adequate handling of the \ngraft mixture.\n(A) Ansef (1 gm) is diluted with 2 ml of saline, 0.2 ml added to membrane and 0.8 ml added to \nthe graft.

The MIC is usually expressed by MIC \n50 or MIC 90, meaning that 50% or 90% of the microbial \nisolates are inhibited, respectively.\nPrevious studies and treatment modalities used amoxicil-\nlin as the irst drug of choice. However, with the increasing \nprevalence of penicillinase- and beta-lactamase–producing \nstrains of Haemophilus inluenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, \nalong with penicillin-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneu-\nmoniae, other alternative antibiotic drugs should be selected.\nBeta-Lactam Medications. The most common beta-lactam \nantibiotic drugs used in the treatment of rhinosinusitis and \ngraft site infections are penicillin (amoxicillin, Augmentin) \nand cephalosporin (Ceftin, Vantin). Amoxicillin has been the \ndrug of choice for years to combat the bacterial strains associ-\nated with rhinosinusitis and infections in the oral cavity. \nHowever, its effectiveness has been questioned recently \nbecause of the high percentage of beta-lactamase–producing \nbacteria and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae. Augmentin \n(amoxicillin-clavulanate) has the added advantage of activity \nagainst beta-lactamase bacteria. It has been associated with a \nhigh incidence of gastrointestinal side effects. However, with \nthe dosing regimen (twice a day [bid]), these complications \nhave been signiicantly decreased.\nTwo recommended cephalosporin medications have also \nbeen suggested to treat rhinosinusitis: cefuroxime axetil \n(Ceftin) and cefpodoxime proxetil (Vantin). Other cephalo-\nsporin drugs fail to achieve adequate sinus luid levels against \nthe causative pathogens. Ceftin and Vantin have good potency \nand eficacy while exhibiting strong activity against resistant \nS. pneumoniae and H. inluenzae.\nFluoroquinolone Medications. Fluoroquinolone drugs are \nbactericidal antibiotic medications that are classiied into \nfour different generations. The third-generation quinolone \ndrugs are well-suited, broad-spectrum antibiotic medications \nand have been labeled by the US Food and Drug Administra-\ntion (FDA) for use against sinus and oral pathogens. They \nexhibit excellent absorption and achieve very signiicant sinus \nblood levels, even in pathologic conditions. Quinolone drugs \nare distributed extensively throughout the sinus, with high \nlevels being found in inlamed tissue and maxillary sinus \ncysts. The tissue/blood ratio is approximately 4 : 1, making it \nextremely potent within the diseased sinus. The three most \ncommon quinolone medications used for sinus treatment \ninclude levoloxacin (Levaquin), gatiloxacin (Tequin), and \nmoxiloxacin (Avelox).\nMacrolide Medications. Macrolide drugs are bacteriostatic \nagents that include erythromycin, clarithromycin (Biaxin), \nand azithromycin (Zithromax). Macrolide medications have \ngood activity against susceptible pneumococci; however, with \nthe increasing rate of macrolide resistance, their use in com-\nbating sinus pathogens is becoming associated with a high \nlikelihood of clinical failure. These antibiotic drugs are very \nactive against M. catarrhalis, although their activity on H. \nshort-term dose of dexamethasone (Decadron). To ensure \npatency of the ostium and minimize inlammation in the \nsinus before surgery, steroid medications are initiated 1 full \nday before surgery. This medication should also be extended \n2 days postoperatively because edema peaks at 48 to 72 hours.\nDecongestant \nmedications. Sympathomimetic \ndrugs \nthat inluence alpha-adrenergic receptors have been used as \ntherapeutic agents for the decongestion of mucous mem-\nbranes. Both systemic and topical decongestant medications \nhave been used in reversing a nonpatent ostium. However, \nrecent recommendations from the otolaryngology literature \ndiscourage the use of these medications. Topical decongestant \ndrugs can cause a rebound phenomenon and the develop-\nment of rhinitis medicamentosa if used more than 3 to 4 days. \nIt should also be noted that the pulse amplitude and blood \nlow in the sinus mucosa is reduced with decongestant drugs \nsuch as oxymetazoline. This may, in turn, decrease the defense \nmechanism of the tissues.67 Oxymetazoline 0.05% (Afrin or \nVicks Nasal Spray) and phenylephrine 1% should not be used \nprophylactically or for therapeutic purposes.\nTreatment\nAlthough the incidence of infection after the procedure is \nusually low, the damaging consequences on osteogenesis and \nthe possibility of serious complications require that any infec-\ntion be aggressively treated. In case of postoperative infection, \nit is recommended that the clinician perform a thorough \nexamination of the area by palpation, percussion, and visual \ninspection to identify the area primarily affected. Infection \nwill usually follow the path of least resistance and is observed \nby changes in speciic anatomic sites to which it spreads.68\nEarly, aggressive treatment is crucial for graft site infec-\ntions to prevent the loss of graft or extension of the infection \ninto the sinus proper causing an acute rhinosinusitis or \nspread of infection to other vital areas. Initially, systemic anti-\nbiotics along with antimicrobial rinses should be used. If \ninfection persists, debridement and drainage should be \ncompleted along with the use of sterile saline and chlorhexi-\ndine. A Penrose drain may also be used in cases that do not \nrespond to systemic antibiotics. In some instances, oroantral \nistulas result after infection cessation (see the section on \noroantral istula).\nAntibiotic treatment in the maxillary sinus, both prophy-\nlactically and therapeutically, is much different than for most \noral surgical procedures. When selecting antibiotic medica-\ntions for sinus infections, a variety of factors must be evalu-\nated. These include the most common type of pathogens \ninvolved, antimicrobial resistance, pharmacokinetic and \npharmacodynamic properties, and the tissue (sinus) penetra-\ntion of the various antibiotic drugs. The antibiotic medica-\ntion of choice should be effective against respiratory and oral \npathogens while exhibiting known activity against resistant \nstrains of the common pathogens. Two such factors are \nused when evaluating sinus antibiotic medications: (1) the \nminimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and (2) the con-\ncentration of antibiotic drugs penetrating inlamed diseased \nsinus tissue. The MIC is the lowest concentration of the"

These antibiotic medications are \nnot suggested to treat postoperative sinus infections.\nLincosamide Medications. Clindamycin (Cleocin) is the \nprimary lincosamide drug used in clinical practice today that \nis considered to be bacteriostatic. However, in high concen-\ntrations, bactericidal activity may be present. Clindamycin is \nmainly used for the treatment of gram-positive aerobes and \nanaerobes. With acute sinus disease, clindamycin is usually \nnot indicated because it exhibits no activity against H. inlu-\nenzae and M. catarrhalis. This drug may be used in chronic \nsinus conditions because anaerobic organisms play a much \nlarger role in the disease process.\nTetracycline Derived Medications. Doxycycline (Vibra-\nmycin) is a bacteriostatic agent with adequate activity against \npenicillin-susceptible pneumococci and M. catarrhalis. This \ndrug does not exhibit any activity against penicillin-resistant \nbacteria and is not effective against H. inluenzae. However, \ndoxycline may be used as an alternative antibiotic for the \ntreatment of acute rhinosinusitis infections.\nSulfonamide Medications. The most common sulfon-\namide drug, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) is \nbacteriostatic. Recently, a high rate of resistance to these \ndrugs has been seen with S. pneumoniae, H. inluenzae, M. \ncatarrhalis, and other sinus pathogens. This drug should not \nbe considered to treat postoperative infections, unless a \nculture and sensitivity test has been performed and suscepti-\nbility is shown.\nMetronidazole Medications. Metronidazole is the most \nimportant member of the nitroimidazole group. It is bacte-\nricidal and is effective against gram-positive and gram-\nnegative anaerobic bacteria. Its main use would be in the \ntreatment of chronic sinus (not acute) conditions. The medi-\ncation should be used with another antibiotic drug to be \neffective against aerobic bacteria.\nAntibiotic Conclusion\nIn the evaluation of different antibiotic drugs used for the \ntreatment of pathologic conditions of the sinus, meticulous \nanalysis of the activity against the most common pathogens \nmust be evaluated. With all of the antibiotic medications \nevaluated, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime axetil, levo-\nloxacin, and moxiloxacin showed signiicant sinonasal and \nMIC 90 blood levels against the most common pathogens \nassociated with sinus infections. Moxiloxacin, a third-\ngeneration luoroquinolone drug, has been shown to have \nsuperior qualities compared with many other antibiotic med-\nications. It shows extensive distribution throughout the \nsinuses in both inlamed and noninlamed sinus tissue, with \nsigniicantly high concentration within maxillary sinus cysts. \nThe tissue/blood ratio is 4 : 1, with blood levels occurring 3 \nto 4 hours after administration. Because of the potency and \nexpense of this medication, it is used only in the treatment \nof severe infections.\nDecongestant Medications. Recent recommendations in \nthe medical literature state that nasal decongestants (sympa-\nthomimetic drugs) should not be used except in severe cases \nof congestion and infection. Nasal decongestants have been \nshown to impair blood low, thus decreasing antibiotic levels \nto the site. Additionally, it may cause a rebound phenomenon \nand the development of rhinitis medicamentosa. This \nrebound phenomenon has been theorized to occur as a nega-\ntive feedback vasodilation after repeated introductions of the \nsympathomimetic (vasoconstricting) drug.\nSaline Rinses. An important treatment for the patient with \nthe presence of acute rhinosinusitis and graft infections is the \nuse of saline rinses with a bulb syringe or a squeeze bottle in \nthe nostril used to lavage the sinus through the ostium. The \nnasal saline rinse has a long history for treatment of sinonasal \ndisease. Hypertonic and isotonic saline rinses have proven to \nbe effective against chronic rhinosinusitis. These techniques \nof nasal irrigation have been evaluated, with the best option \nof a positive-pressure irrigation using a squeeze bottle that \ndelivers a gentle stream of saline to the nasal cavity (NeilMed’s \nSinus Rinse [NeilMed Pharmaceuticals Inc.]). The syringe or \nsqueeze bottle should not seal the nasal opening because this \nmay force bacteria up toward the ethmoidal sinus. Instead, a \ngentle lavage with sterile saline rinses the sinus and lushes \nout the mucus and exudate. Ideally, the head is placed down \nand forward so that the saline can reach the ostium in the \nsuperior and anterior portion of the sinus. The course of \ntherapy should continue for at least 7 days.69 Another option \nis for the use of a Neti-Pot, which is very common amongst \nchronic rhinosinusitis patients (Fig. 13.51).\nACUTE RHINOSINUSITIS INFECTIONS\nEtiology of Acute Rhinosinusitis\nThere are two causes of acute maxillary rhinosinusitis after \nsinus graft surgery: (1) preexisting maxillary sinus pathology, \nor (2) progression of sinus graft surgery to involve the maxil-\nlary sinus proper.\nDiagnosis\nMaxillary rhinosinusitis is a complication that arises when \nthe patient postoperatively complains of any of the following \nsymptoms: (mild) headache, pain, or tenderness in the area \nof the maxillary sinus, rhinorrhea, or (severe) fever, headache, \nor ocular symptoms. Studies have supported the fact that \npatients who had predisposing factors for rhinosinusitis were \nmore at risk of developing postoperative transient rhinosi-\nnusitis. The wide range of reported percentages (3% to 20%) \nmay be the result of different methods used for diagnosis (i.e., \nclinical, radiographic, endoscopic).\nCases of maxillary sinusitis after dental implant surgery \nhave rarely been reported in the dental literature. However, \nrecently in the medical literature, numerous cases of minor \nto severe complications after sinus surgery have been docu-\nmented. Although very infrequent, severe infections may lead \nto more severe complications, such as orbital cellulitis, optic"

Prophylactic antibiotic medica-\ntions and sound surgical principles minimize postoperative \ninfections and complications. The resistance of the sinus to \ncontamination is low, and the chances of this happening are \neasily increased with contamination by intraoral or sinus \npathogens. The use of systemic antibiotics, antimicrobial \nmouth rinses, and corticosteroids will help maintain the \npatency of the ostium.\nTreatment\nIf infection occurs postoperatively, treatment must be aggres-\nsive because of the possible complications that may arise to \nclose anatomic structures. Systemic antibiotic therapy is the \nirst line of treatment along with close observation of symp-\ntoms. Recent medical literature discourages the use of sys-\ntemic decongestants and highly recommends the use of saline \nlavage and rinses. Systemic decongestants have been shown \nto impair site antibiotic delivery and also have a high degree \nof rebound effect (rhinitis medicamentosa).\nIf symptoms are not alleviated with antibiotic and decon-\ngestant medications, possible referral to the patient’s physi-\ncian or otolaryngologist is warranted. Emergency consultation \nshould be considered if the patient complains of a severe \nheadache that is not relieved by mild analgesics, as well as \npersistent or high fever, lethargy, visual impairment, or orbital \nswelling.\nThe authors highly recommend that a professional asso-\nciation with an otolaryngologist be obtained.

Addi-\ntionally, if mild sinus symptoms persist or signs of severe \ninfection are present, immediate referral is recommended. \nResolution of these conditions has been accomplished with \nthe use of antibiotic drugs, endoscopic treatment, or Caldwell-\nLuc procedures.\nCOMBINATION (GRAFT SITE INFECTIONS/\nACUTE RHINOSINUSITIS)\nEtiology\nThe etiology of a combination infection can either be initi-\nated from the graft site or the sinus proper.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis for a combination type infection can parallel \na combination of graft site symptoms and/or acute \nrhinosinusitis.\nPrevention\nSame preventive techniques discussed previously for graft site \ninfections and acute rhinosinusitis.\nTreatment\nThe treatment of a combination type infection should include \nthe use of a beta-lactam antibiotic (e.g., Augmentin) followed \nby the use of debridement and nasal saline rinses.

Additionally, implants left in the maxillary \nmay become calciied (antrolith) or become displaced into \nother anatomic areas (e.g., sinuses, orbit, nasal cavity, brain). \nThe patients should be referred as soon as possible for \nremoval via a Caldwell-Luc approach or endoscopy (FESS) \n(Fig. 13.52).\nor cerebral symptoms persist, or the patient does not respond \nto antibiotic treatment, referral is recommended.\nPOSTOPERATIVE CBCT MUCOSAL \nTHICKENING (FALSE-POSITIVE  \nFOR INFECTION)\nImmediate postoperative radiographs may reveal signiicant \nmucosal thickening within the sinus. The clinician should not \ndetermine this to be infection unless the above signs of infec-\ntion are noted. Normally, elevation of the sinus mucosa and \nbone grafting does alter the overall maxillary sinus environ-\nment by reducing the size of the sinus and repositioning the \nmucociliary transport system. In spite of this, only short-term \nclearance impairment exists, resulting in only subclinical \neffects on the sinus physiology. However, in cases of preop-\nerative sinusitis histories, elevation surgery may predispose a \npatient to sinus-related complications. It has been shown that \nthese procedures do alter the microbial environment. Studies \nreveal at 3 months after surgery, positive sinus cultures were \npresent compared with cultures taken for the same patients \npreoperatively. However, after 9 months the cultures were \nsimilar to the preelevation results. The key is maintenance of \nthe osteomeatal opening between the maxillary sinus and the \nnasal cavity.\nMIGRATION/DISPLACEMENT OF IMPLANT\nIn 1995 the irst case of a displaced (migrated) implant into \nthe maxillary sinus was documented. Since then, an increased \nnumber of reports are coming to light, documenting an ever-\nincreasing problem. Reports have shown that implants \nmigrating from the maxillary sinus have been found in the \nsphenoid sinus, ethmoid sinus, orbit, nasal cavity, and ante-\nrior cranial base.\nEtiology\nThe etiology of implant displacement or migration from the \nmaxillary sinus includes many possibilities. The timing of \nimplants ending up in the maxillary sinus proper varies from \nintraoperative displacement to migration years later. Many \netiologic factors have been suggested according to the timing \n(early vs. late) (Table 13.2).\nPrevention\nFor early migration/displacement complications, most likely \nthe cause is surgical error or incorrect treatment planning. \nWhen evaluating late migration/placement complications, \nthe majority of issues are a direct result of postoperative \nprosthetic errors (too early loading) or factors that are pre-\ncipitated by lack of integration or minimal bone at the \nimplant interface.\nManagement\nThe management of displaced or migrated implants into the \nmaxillary sinus should be treated with urgency.

Fungal sinusitis is a destructive, invasive disease \nwhich is mostly caused by Aspergillus. Aspergillus spp is a \nfungus of the Ascomycetes class, which is one of the most \ncommonly encountered in the human environment.\nIn the diagnosis of fungal sinusitis, there exist two forms: \nnoninvasive and invasive. The invasive form is rare and is \nalmost always associated with immunocompromised patients. \nErosion and osseous destruction occurs that may be fatal. \nHowever, this form has not been associated with dental \nimplants or sinus graft surgery.\nCase studies have shown postoperative complications after \nsinus graft surgery71 and overextension of root canal illing \ninvolving the noninvasive form.72 This type of fungus growth \nis also termed fungus balls or asperilloma and is associated \nwith immunocompetent patients.\nDiagnosis\nUsually, the patient will present with clinical symptoms of \nfrontal headache, orbicular pain, nasal congestion, and bleed-\ning with signs of chronic rhinosinusitis. Radiographically, a \ndistinctly increased soft tissue density mass (radiopacity) is \nseen on CBCT scans.\nManagement\nReferral to an ENT for evaluation and conirmation of diag-\nnosis. Usually, treatment involves surgical removal via \nCaldwell-Luc or FESS techniques because systemic antimy-\ncotic drugs are ineffective.\nPOSTOPERATIVE MAXILLARY  \nSURGICAL CYSTS\nPostoperative maxillary surgical cysts have been reported in \nthe literature after sinus graft surgery. However, they are \nextremely rare. In 1927, Kubo reported a postoperative maxil-\nlary cyst arising in the maxilla as a delayed complication of \nradical surgical intervention in the maxillary sinus.36 In 1992, \nMisch et al reported one incidence of a maxillary surgical cyst \nassociated with a past sinus graft and blade implant. Com-\nplete enucleation was accomplished, and healing was unevent-\nful.37 Incidence reports are more common in Japan, where \nsinus disease is often treated aggressively with surgery, but are \nrare in other parts of the world.73\nREFERENCES\n1.

Misch\n14 \nThe placement of endosseous implants at the time of tooth \nextraction has been shown to be a viable protocol.1-5 The \nobjectives of immediate implant placement are the same as \nfor staged treatment: achievement of implant primary stabil-\nity, suficient rigid ixation after healing, proper prosthetic \nlocation, and an esthetic result. Immediate implant place-\nment has the potential to accomplish these objectives with \nfewer procedures, less treatment time, and less cost. Although \ncomplications can occur with any particular technique or \nprotocol, this technique adds multiple variables that cumula-\ntively place the clinician more at risk of having an adverse \nresult (Table 14.1). Extraction and immediate implant place-\nment may also be combined with immediate provisionaliza-\ntion (either nonfunctional or loaded). This chapter will \naddress complications speciically related to immediate \nimplant placement at the time of extraction.\nGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS\nImmediate implant placement after tooth extraction has the \npotential to decrease the number of appointments as well as \ntreatment time. Patient acceptance of this technique is high. \nOptimal esthetics in many cases is possible along with hard \nand soft tissue preservation (Figs. 14.1, 14.2, and 14.3). The \ncaveat relates to case selection and changing medicolegal \nstandards. Before discussing immediate placement complica-\ntions, a review of alternative (staged) placement is presented, \nwith contrasts to immediate placement where applicable.\nAVAILABLE BONE\nAvailable bone describes the amount of bone in the edentulous \nextraction site considered for implantation. It is measured in \nwidth, height, length, angulation, and crown height space (Fig. \n14.4). As a general guideline, 1.5 to 2 mm of surgical error is \nmaintained between the implant and any adjacent landmark. \nThis is especially critical when the opposing landmark is the \nmandibular inferior alveolar nerve. However, the implant may \nbe placed without complication through the cortical plate of \nthe maxillary sinus or inferior border of the mandible. The \nimplant may also be positioned closer to the cribriform plate \nof a natural tooth.6 When placing an implant in an immediate-\nextraction site, the surgeon needs to consider the socket dimen-\nsion and the defect between the labial plate of bone and the \nimplant. The faciopalatal dimension of an anterior tooth, for \nexample, is often greater than its mesiodistal dimension. When \nan anterior tooth requires extraction, during the extraction \nprocess the thin facial cortex often becomes compromised or \nlost. As a result, it is most always several millimeters apical to \nthe palatal cortical plate, and frequently bone grafting and/or \nmembrane placement in conjunction with the implant inser-\ntion are needed. Immediate implant placement in the anterior \nregion using a round implant often requires that the osteotomy \nand implant insertion engage the lingual wall of the alveolus \nand penetrate halfway to two thirds of the way down the extrac-\ntion site into the remaining lingual apical bone for rigid ixation \n(Fig. 14.5). This surgical approach is more challenging than \npreparing the osteotomy in a homogenous bone density. The \nbest implant size is often 4 to 5 mm in diameter for a central \nincisor because the associated extraction socket is often greater \nthan 6 mm (especially in the faciopalatal dimension), so a sur-\ngical defect as large as 2 mm remains around the implant. More \nor less broad, oval, or kidney-shaped spaces have been described \nto run coronoapically along the entire surface of the socket next \nto the implant.7 The natural resorption of the facial plate may \nnot be halted by implant insertion, and bone implant contact \nmay be reduced when the facial plate resorbs.8\nAvailable Bone Height\nThe height of available bone is measured from the crest of \nthe edentulous ridge to the opposing landmark. The anterior \nregions are limited by the maxillary nares or the inferior \nborder of the mandible. The anterior regions of the jaws have \nthe greatest height because the maxillary sinus and inferior \nalveolar nerve limit this dimension in the posterior regions. \nThe maxillary canine eminence region often offers the great-\nest height of available bone in the maxillary anterior.9 In the \nposterior jaw region, there is usually greater bone height in \nthe maxillary irst premolar than in the second premolar, \nwhich has greater height than the molar sites because of the \nconcave morphology of the maxillary sinus loor. Likewise, \nthe mandibular irst premolar region is usually anterior to the \nmental foramen and provides the most vertical column of \nbone in the posterior mandible. However, on occasion, this \npremolar site may present a reduced height compared with \nthe anterior region because of the presence of an anterior loop \nof the mandibular canal. The nerve courses anteriorly below \nthe foramen and proceeds superiorly, then distally, before its \nexit through the mental foramen.

Primary stability for immediately placed implants \nis frequently achieved using bone apical to the extraction site. \nIn the posterior mandible, the course of the inferior alveolar \nnerve can vary from Type 1 to Type 3 with associated available \napical bone ranging from nonexistent to suficient and \nsurgical risk varying accordingly. In addition, variants of the \nmental foramen exist that can increase the possibility of injury \nto the inferior alveolar nerve during immediate implant \nplacement in the region (Fig. 14.6). The available bone height \nin an edentulous site is the most important dimension for \nimplant consideration because it affects both implant length \nand crown height. Crown height affects force factors and \nesthetics. In addition, vertical bone augmentation, if needed, \nis less predictable then width augmentation.\nAvailable Bone Width\nThe width of available bone is measured between the facial \nand lingual plates at the crest of the potential implant site. It \nis the next most signiicant criterion affecting long-term sur-\nvival of endosteal implants. The crestal aspect of the residual \nridge is often cortical in nature and exhibits greater density \nthan the underlying trabecular bone regions, especially in the \nmandible.\nAccordingly, the lack of crestal bone at an extraction site \nmakes the achievement of primary stability more challenging \nfor immediate implant placement. Facial dehiscence defects \ncommonly found after tooth extraction and immediate \nimplant placement have been shown to have more compro-\nmised healing as compared to infrabony defects.10\nAvailable Bone Length\nBone length is deined as the mesiodistal length of bone in a \npostextraction area. It is most often limited by adjacent teeth \nor implants. As a general rule the implant should be at least \n1.5 mm from an adjacent tooth and 3 mm from an adjacent \nimplant. This dimension not only allows surgical error but \nalso compensates for the width of an implant or tooth crestal \ndefect, which is usually less than 1.4 mm and may vary with \nimplant diameter and thread design. As a result, if bone loss \noccurs around the crest module of an implant or around a \ntooth with periodontal disease, the associated vertical bone \ndefect will not typically expand into horizontal defect and \nthereby cause bone loss on the adjacent structure.\nBone Angulation\nBone angulation is an additional determinant for available \nbone. The initial alveolar bone angulation represents the \nnatural tooth root trajectory in relation to the occlusal plane. \nIdeally, it is perpendicular to the plane of occlusion, which is \naligned with the forces of occlusion and is parallel to the \nlong axis of the prosthodontic restoration. The incisal and \nocclusal surfaces of the teeth follow the curve of Wilson and \ncurve of Spee. As such, the roots of the maxillary teeth are \nangled toward a common point approximately 4 inches \naway. The mandibular roots lare, so the anatomic crowns \nare more lingually inclined in the posterior regions and labi-\nally inclined in the anterior area compared with the underly-\ning roots. The mandibular irst premolar cusp tip is usually \nvertical to its root apex. The maxillary anterior teeth are the \nonly segment in either arch that does not receive a long axis \nload to the tooth roots but instead are usually loaded at a \n12-degree angle. As such, their root diameter is greater than"

In all other regions the teeth \nare loaded perpendicular to the curves of Wilson or Spee. \nThe anterior sextants may have labial undercuts that often \nmandate greater angulation of the implants or concurrent \ngrafting of the site after insertion. The narrower width ridge \noften requires a root form implant design that is likewise \nnarrower. Compared with larger diameters, smaller-diameter \ndesigns cause greater crestal stress and may not offer the \nsame range of custom abutments.

This limitation of bone-implant contact could compro-\nmise primary stability for immediate implant placement. \n(From Misch CE: Contemporary implant dentistry, ed 3, \nSt Louis, 2008, Mosby.)\nTYPE OF PROSTHESIS\nThe clinician must always be aware of the anticipated inal \nprosthesis and its associated dimensions of crown-height \nspace, whether for a single tooth crown or full arch prosthesis. \nIn cases where tooth extraction will result in an edentulous \narch, the frequent need for alveoloplasty may result in almost \ncomplete elimination of the residual socket, thus making it \ncomparable to an implant placement protocol for a healed site.\nWhen considering immediate implant placement for par-\ntially edentulous patients, the dimension of the tooth space(s) \nbeing replaced, in the context of the desired inal tooth posi-\ntioning within and between the arches, may require orth-\nodontic evaluation and treatment. Typical examples would be \nextruded and tipped teeth.\nBONE DENSITY\nBone quality or density refers to the internal structure of \nbone and relects a number of its biomechanical properties, \nsuch as strength and modulus of elasticity. The density of \navailable bone in a potential implant site is a determining \nfactor in treatment planning, implant design, surgical \napproach, healing time, and initial progressive bone loading \nduring prosthetic reconstruction. The quality of bone is often \ndependent upon the arch position. The most dense bone is \nusually observed in the anterior mandible, with less dense \nbone in the anterior maxilla and posterior mandible, and the \nleast dense bone typically found in the posterior maxilla. In \naddition to arch location, several independent groups have \nreported different failure rates related to the quality of the \nbone. Johns et al reported 3% failure of implants in moderate \nbone densities, but a 28% implant failure in the poorest bone \ntype.11 Smedberg et al reported a 36% failure rate in the \npoorest bone density.12 The reduced implant survival most \noften is more related to bone density than arch location. In a \n15-year follow-up study, Snauwaert et al reported early \nannual and late failures were more frequently found in the \nmaxilla.13 Hermann et al14 found implant failures were \nstrongly correlated to patient factors, including bone quality, \nespecially when coupled with poor bone volume. Bone quality \nis directly related to the ability to achieve an acceptable level \nof primary ixation for immediate implant placement as well \nas long-term success for all placement protocols."

Lambert reported surgical experi-\nence may inluence the success or failure of dental implants \nfrom initial placement to second-stage surgery.24 Preiskel et al \nconcluded that a 2-year differential of surgical experience can \nhave a major impact on the failure probability of unloaded \nimplants.25 Geckili noted a decrease in failure rate from 4.6% \nto 1.6% owing to the presumptive improvement in the skill \nof the surgeon over a 5-year period.26 The added variable of \nperioperative bone grafting, frequently performed during \nimmediate implant placement, was thought to negatively \naffect implant success rates in a 6-year study by Smith. That \nstudy reported an overall 1-year survival of 94% and a 5-year \nsurvival of 92.8%. In addition, there were a relatively high \nproportion of technical failures due to errors in treatment \nplanning or surgical technique, which accounted for the intra-\noperative failures (33%) and late failures (14%) that were \nattributed to the experience levels of the surgical trainees.27\nIMPLANT SIZE\nLength Relative to Tooth or Teeth  \nBeing Replaced\nProsthesis type, bone density, and anticipated load factors \nare treatment plan modiiers affecting implant size, design, \nnumber, surface condition, and the need/method of progres-\nsive loading.\nThe implant dimension of width is often limited by adja-\ncent teeth or implants. As a general rule the implant should \nbe at least 1.5 mm from an adjacent tooth and 3 mm from \nan adjacent implant. This dimension not only allows for sur-\ngical error but also compensates for the width of an implant \nor tooth crestal defect, which is usually less than 1.4 mm. As \na result, if bone loss occurs at the crest module of an implant \nor from periodontal disease with a tooth, the vertical bone \ndefect will not spread horizontally and cause bone loss on the \nadjacent structure.28 The ideal implant width for single-tooth \nreplacement or multiple adjacent implants is often related to \nthe natural tooth that is being replaced in the site. The tooth \nhas its greatest width at the interproximal contacts, is nar-\nrower at the cement-enamel junction (CEJ), and is even nar-\nrower at the initial crestal bone contact, which is 2 mm below \nthe CEJ. The ideal implant diameter corresponds to the width \nof the natural tooth 2 mm below the CEJ, if it also is 1.5 mm \nfrom the adjacent tooth. In this way the implant crown emer-\ngence through the soft tissue may be similar to that of a \nnatural tooth (Table 14.2).6 The ability to select the most ideal \nimplant size based on these parameters is much less dificult \nin a healed site as compared to an extraction site.

Regional variations in both \navailable bone and bone density have already been described. \nThe initial treatment plan prior to surgery suggests the ante-\nrior maxilla be treated as D3 bone, the posterior maxilla as D4 \nbone, the anterior mandible as D2 bone, and the posterior \nmandible as D3 bone. Bone remodeling, including loss of \nbone density, is primarily related to the length of time the \nregion has been edentulous and therefore not loaded, the \ninitial density of the bone, and mandibular lexure and torsion. \nImmediate implant placement can take advantage of the fact \nthat implant placement can be performed before the bone \ndensity in the jaws begins its usual decline after tooth loss.\nPRESENCE OF BACTERIA/ \nEXISTING PATHOLOGY\nImmediate implant placement is generally recognized as a \nmore complex procedure in contrast to implant placement in \na healed ridge of adequate bone quality. The presence of \ninfection adds an additional variable to this complexity. A site \ncan be classiied as having either periapical, endodontic, peri-\noendodontic, or periodontal infection. Multiple studies have \nfound the survival rates for implants immediately placed in \ninfected sockets similar to those placed in noninfected sockets \nor healed ridges.15-17 These reviews, however, should be inter-\npreted taking into account the classiication of infection was \noften vague and varied among the studies.\nBIOMECHANICAL OVERLOAD ISSUES\nImmediate occlusal loading on temporary crowns positioned \nimmediately on implants placed in fresh extraction sockets \nhave been shown to reduce treatment time. A number of dif-\nferent immediate load protocols have been described in the \nliterature (Schnitman, Tarnow, Misch).18-20 An acknowledged \ncommon concern, however, is the risk of occlusal overload. \nOften the risks of this procedure are perceived to be highest \nduring the irst week after the implant insertion surgery. In \nreality, the bone interface is stronger on the day of implant \nplacement than it is 3 months later.21 As a result of the surgical \nplacement, organized, mineralized lamellar bone in the prep-\naration site becomes unorganized, less mineralized, woven \nbone of repair next to the implant.22 The implant-bone inter-\nface is weakest and most at risk of overload at 3 to 6 weeks \nafter surgical insertion because the surgical trauma causes \nbone remodeling at the interface that is least mineralized and \nunorganized during this time frame. A clinical report by \nBuchs et al23 found immediately loaded implant failure \noccurred primarily between 3 and 5 weeks after implant \ninsertion from mobility without infection.

Given the desire for \nlong-term implant survival and health, careful selection of \nimplant design should include the features of titanium alloy \nmaterial, roughened surface treatment, tapered crest module, \nand square thread design.37,38\nMany biocompatible materials are unable to withstand the \ntype and magnitude of loads that may be imposed on dental \nimplants. Titanium and titanium alloys have a long history \nof successful use in dental and orthopedic applications. The \nexcellent biocompatibility of titanium and its alloy has \nbeen well documented. Titanium-aluminum-vanadium alloy \n(Ti-6Al-4V) has been shown to exhibit the most attractive \ncombination of mechanical and physical properties, corro-\nsion resistance, and general biocompatibility of all metallic \nbiomaterials.39,40 The primary advantage of titanium alloy as \ncompared with other grades of titanium is its strength. Ulti-\nmate strength and fatigue strength are primary consider-\nations given the ramiications of the loading proiles to which \ndental implant bodies are subjected and that can still place \nan alloy at fracture risk (Fig. 14.8).\nCrest module design has a signiicant inluence in regard \nto overall implant body design. There are at least six causes \nof marginal bone loss at the crestal bone region of implants, \nincluding the formation of a “biologic width” and occlusal \noverload after the implant is in function.6 Ultimate strength \nand fatigue strength are primary considerations given the \nramiications of the loading proiles to which dental implant \nbodies are subjected and that still can place an implant of \nideal dimensions at fracture risk. The crest module of an \nimplant should be slightly larger than the outer thread diam-\neter of the implant body (Fig. 14.9). In this way the crest \nFIG 14.8 Fractured 5.0-mm ext hex implant.

The next consideration of the \ncrest module is related to occlusal loading. Most of the occlu-\nsal stress occurs at the crestal region of an implant design \n(Fig. 14.10). A smooth, parallel-sided crest module will \nincrease the risk of bone loss after loading, whereas any crest \nmodule design that incorporates an angled geometry or \ngrooves to the crest module, coupled with a surface texture \nthat increases bone contact, will impose a beneicial compres-\nsive component to the contiguous bone and decrease the risk \nof bone loss (Fig. 14.11).\nThe surface condition of the implant is particularly impor-\ntant for healing of immediately placed implants. The bone-\nimplant contact (BIC) of roughened implants has been \nshown to be increased during initial healing as compared to \nsmooth metal.41 Lastly, although selection of thread shape \nshould be optimized for long-term load function, thread \nshape may have an inluence on the initial healing phase of \nosseointegration.

The presence of exudate \nlowers the pH, which causes a solution-mediated resorption \nof the grafted bone and contaminates the implant body with \na bacterial smear layer, which in turn reduces bone contact. \nAn improved bone interface may be obtained if the large-\ndiameter extraction site is grafted before implant placement. \nIf the labial plate is compromised, additional intraorally har-\nvested bone and/or GBR are indicated. The delayed implant \ninsertion method appears to enhance capillary propagation \nand trabecular formation before implant placement, facilitat-\ning the formation of an implant-bone interface.44 A staged \nprotocol allows the soft tissue to granulate over the aug-\nmented extraction site, creating an increased zone of attached \ngingiva. The result of the augmentation can be evaluated \nbefore implant placement, rather than dealing with compro-\nmises after implant integration. In this way the implant may \nbe placed in an ideal position in relation to the crestal bone \nand the adjacent teeth and within the exact contours of the \ninal restoration.6\nINTRAOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS\nPREVENTION RELATED TO AN IMMEDIATE \nPLACEMENT PROTOCOL\nPresence of Nonintact Alveolar Socket\nBone ill around an implant in an extraction site is most \nfavorable when an intact socket is present. A nonintact socket \nmay be encountered, either related to a preexisting condition \nor the tooth extraction process. This unanticipated loss of \nbone may have an extent and anatomy that the clinician may \nbe unprepared to address if expectations were only of an \nintact socket.\nPrevention\nThorough Pretreatment Evaluation. The type of extrac-\ntion defect (e.g., walls of bone present) can be anticipated \nwith careful preoperative clinical exam that includes peri-\nodontal probing along with two- and three-dimensional \nradiographs. This clinical data, including attachment levels, \nis useful in accessing the periodontium for bone defects \nsuch as dehiscences.\nAtraumatic Tooth Extraction. Once the extraction of a \nnatural tooth is indicated, methods to maintain or obtain the \nneeded surrounding hard and soft tissues are indicated. \nAvoiding soft tissue injury reduces dimensional loss of the \nunderlying bone because the periosteum supplies more than \n80% of the blood supply to cortical bone.45 The extraction of \na natural tooth begins with an incision within the sulcus, \npreferably with a thin scalpel blade rather than a blunt perio-\ntome, 360 degrees around the tooth, to cut the connective \ntissue attachment ibers above the bone. The next step in an \natraumatic extraction process is to observe the crown and \nplacement after extraction typically include countersinking \nthe implant 2 mm or more below the facial plate (which is \nalready more apical than the palatal plate) and placing a \nbiomaterial such as deproteinized bovine bone, calcium \nphosphate (CaPO4), resorbable hydroxyapatite (HA), \nallograft, and/or autologous bone to ill the labial defect, with \nor without the addition of connective tissue grafts and/or \nmembranes. Many classiications and protocols have been \npublished with regard to immediate implant placement. The \nimplant will obtain rigid ixation with nearly all of these \ntechniques. However, the goal of implant therapy is not \nlimited solely to rigid ixation. The inability to achieve proper \nesthetic and health parameters constitutes a compromised \nresult and increased risk of esthetic or implant failure.42 \nWhen the implant is countersunk below the facial bone, the \nimplant platform may be as much as 4 mm apical to the CEJ \nof the adjacent teeth, which increases the anatomic crown \nheight and the pocket depth, especially after crestal bone loss \nduring the irst year. In addition, synthetic grafts, if used, \nplaced around the titanium implant grow less dense quality \nbone that is also limited in implant contact. The capacity of \nthis less dense bone promoted by barrier membranes around \nimplants to withstand loading seems to be limited, and \nanimal studies indicate as much as 85% may be lost after \nloading.43 An explanation may be that no blood vessels arise \nfrom the implant; to the contrary, it reduces the number of \nbony walls of the defect and limits blood supply to the facial \nbone graft. As a result, bone is less likely to form, and when \nit forms it is less dense and more at risk of resorption once \nthe implant is loaded. Although primary closure of the soft \ntissue provides a more predictable result when bone grafting \nis performed, it may be more dificult with an immediate \nextraction technique. Although not advocated, the labial \ntissue is often relected to approximate the tissue over the \nsocket defect. This technique further compromises the blood \nsupply to the labial cortical bone and also decreases the \namount of facial keratinized gingiva because the facial tissues \nare placed over the extraction socket. As a consequence, some \ntype of mucogingival corrective surgery may be indicated \nafter stage I healing to restore the facial attached and keratin-\nized tissue. The labial bone usually remodels to 0.5 mm below \nthe abutment-implant connection (which was, in most cases, \nalready countersunk below the facial bone and several milli-\nmeters below the palatal bone). Bone loss may continue in \nthe region to the irst thread (as a result of the implant crest \nmodule design), then stabilize in a region of greater bone \ndensity. As a consequence, reports often illustrate soft tissue \npocket depths greater than 7 to 8 mm at the midfacial tooth \nposition. The presence of anaerobic microorganisms in soft \ntissue pockets of 5 mm or more has been documented. With \ngood hygiene the soft tissue often recedes, with a resulting \nlengthened clinical crown and “black triangles” in the inter-\nproximal areas caused by the absence of properly developed \ninterdental papillae, which compromises long-term esthetics \nand/or contributes to soft tissue complications.

Regeneration restores com-\nplete morphology and bone volume to the residual ridge. \nThis most often occurs when there are ive thick, bony walls \naround the extraction site. Most of the keys for predictable \nbone formation are present under these conditions, and the \nsocket often forms bone in the extraction socket without \nloss of width or height. The atraumatic extraction of a \ntooth without pathology provides many of the keys neces-\nsary for predictable bone regeneration. The soft tissue \naround the extraction site begins to grow over the clot and \ngranulation tissue of the socket and within 2 to 3 weeks \ncovers the site.\nFour- to ive-wall bony socket. When a labial plate \naround a socket is missing, the absence of the wall prevents \nspace maintenance, reduces host bone vascularization, and \nreplaces it with soft tissue vascularization. The facial bone \nlevel will never grow above the height of bone on the facial \ncortical plate of the tooth. Bone augmentation procedures \nmust be used to obtain an ideal volume and contour of \nbone. Sockets with a missing lateral wall are signiicantly \ncompromised and heal by repair rather than regeneration. \nThe irst determination after the tooth extraction is com-\nplete is the assessment of the thickness of labial and palatal \nplates of bone and their relative height to the ideal volume \ndesired. When one of the lateral plates of bone is thinner \nthan 1.5 mm or when height is desired, a socket graft is \nindicated, even in the presence of ive bony walls. A similar \nsocket augmentation procedure also may be used when the \nlabial plate of bone is missing. The two techniques of choice \nare a barrier membrane (BM) with a mineralized alloplast/\nfreeze-dried bone (FDB) socket ill or a modiied socket \nseal surgery.\nBarrier membrane with alloplast/freeze-dried bone. An \nacellular dermal matrix is selected for a BM when soft tissue \naugmentation is also desired, or a collagen membrane is used \nwhen the soft tissue drape is not an issue. A periotome or thin \nperiosteal elevator is used to tunnel under the inal bone \nperiosteum and lift the soft tissue off the bone over the thin \nbony wall. This tunnel should extend several millimeters \nbeyond the desired augmentation site. A BM is then slid into \nthe “pocket” created under the tissue and extends apical, \nmesial, and distal beyond the extraction site. Approximately \n6 to 8 mm of the BM should extend above the marginal \ntissue. When the facial plate is thin, the socket may be illed \nwith FDB (e.g., MinerOss, Puros) or a mineralized HA source \n(e.g., BioOss, Osteograf-N). When the labial plate is missing, \nthe FDB may be placed in the apical portion, but particulate \nautologous bone should be placed in the crestal half of the \nsocket. The walls of bone on the mesial, distal, and palatal \nprovide bone blood vessels to this autograft. The extension \nof collagen or AlloDerm then covers the top of the socket and \nis tucked below the palatal tissue. Sutures are then placed over \nthe top of the BM. Primary closure of the soft tissues is not \nobtained because the tissues would need to be relected and \nadvanced over the socket, which would affect the soft tissue \ndrape. The extraction site may be reentered after 4 to 6 \nmonths. The clinical time for reentry is determined by the \nroot anatomy, especially in multirooted teeth. Proximal \nreduction may be indicated to prevent damage to adjacent \nteeth and provide space for bone expansion around the \nroot(s). If the roots of the tooth to be extracted are divergent, \nthey should be sectioned and removed as individual units, \nrather than risking fracture of the roots or surrounding bone. \nPeriotomes and dental elevators, which both use the mechan-\nical advantage of a wedge, can then be used to initiate the \nluxation of teeth for their removal. A traditional dental \nforceps can then be used to grasp the tooth for any needed \nadditional luxation prior to tooth removal. Alternatively, a \nbiomechanically based forceps (physics forceps) can be used. \nIts increased mechanical advantage may allow for tooth \nremoval without application of rotational forces, minimizing \npotential fracture of the facial plate of bone.46\nTreatment Options\nAbort Procedure.

Although this \ndiscussion will focus on particulate grafting techniques, \nthe clinician needs to carefully discern the scope and objec-\ntives of an augmentation case in the context of defect size, \nanticipated soft tissue contours, healing time, and skill/\nexperience level.\nBarrier membranes and guided bone regeneration. \nThere are disadvantages to using GBR procedures for all \nhost defects or deiciencies. Bone height and width augmen-\ntation with BM are usually limited to less than 3 to 4 mm. \nSoft tissue contours are more dificult to predict. Extended \nhealing times are necessary. The bone quality is often less \nthan ideal. The concept for GBR is to place a BM directly \nover a bone defect and under the soft tissue (including the \nperiosteum) before primary closure. It has been accepted \nthat the periosteum is a source of osteoblasts for bone for-\nmation and takes part in the bone augmentation process. \nHowever, this apparently is incorrect. When the periosteum \nis placed directly over a particulate bone graft, bone does \nnot form under the periosteum. Instead, ibrous tissue is \nobserved on the surface. When a barrier membrane is placed \nover the particulate graft, bone is found. The new bone \nforms from the surrounding walls of host bone and follows \nthe invading blood vessels from the host bone, which grows \ninto the space provided by the membrane or particulate \ngraft. A wide range of BM exists for GBR. There are three \nprimary categories of absorbable BM for GBR: collagen \nmembranes, polylactic/polyglycolic acid membranes, and \nacellular dermal matrix. The ideal BM should be absorbable \n(but last long enough for predictable bone formation), \ndecrease tissue movement and, when necessary, increase the \ntissue thickness over the bone graft. Clinical studies of GBR \nwith different resorption rates, from 6 weeks to 6 months, \noften demonstrate similar bone augmentation results. This \nincludes Biomend, which absorbs over 4 to 8 weeks. Bio-\nGuide is a bilayer collagen membrane from types I and III \nporcine collagen and absorbs over a 2- to 4-week period. \nOssix is a porcine barrier membrane that may take more \nthan 6 months to absorb. It appears that once the blood \nvessels from host bone invade the bone graft space, the other \nkey factors are more relevant (e.g., graft immobilization). \nAnother type of barrier membrane is AlloDerm (LifeCell \nCorporation). This dermal allograft is deepithelialized skin \ntissue processed to remove all cells, leaving an acellular \ndermal matrix. The collagen, elastin, and proteoglycans are \nstill present and allow for an inert avascular connective \ntissue to be obtained.52 As a result, the acellular allograft \ntissue material may become completely and permanently \nincorporated into the soft tissue after 6 weeks rather than \nresorbing as a collagen BM; thus it may increase tissue thick-\nness over the graft site. This is beneicial in esthetic zones \nwhen the soft tissue drape needs to be developed. Because it \nbinds to the overlying soft tissue, it may create a zone of \nimmobile tissue. This is a beneit for particulate graft immo-\nbilization and for implant soft tissue maintenance after the \nprosthesis delivery.\nabsence of the cortical lining of the socket (cribriform plate) \non a periapical radiograph. Once this has occurred, the \nimplant may be inserted and followed by a regular healing \nand restoration protocol.\nSocket seal surgery. A composite graft socket seal \nsurgery has been developed by Misch et al48,49 composed of \nconnective tissue, periosteum, and trabecular bone used to \nseal a fresh extraction socket. A connective tissue graft has \nthe advantage over a keratinized graft of blending into the \nsurrounding attached gingival regions, offering similar color \nand texture of the epithelium. This is most advantageous in \nthe maxillary anterior region and other aesthetic areas. The \ncomposite graft also contains autogenous bone. The major \nadvantage of autologous bone is a more rapid and predict-\nable bone formation via osteogenesis. This technique may be \nused any time a tooth is extracted and an implant is planned \nas replacement. It employs the use of a 6- to 10-mm trephine \nburr (corresponding to the extraction site diameter) in a \nslow-speed, high-torque handpiece to harvest a gingival graft \nwith underlying bone. The most common site for the intra-\noral composite graft harvest is the maxillary tuberosity \nregion. The bone core (usually 5 to 10 mm in height) \nand the attached soft tissue (about 3 mm in height) are \ntrimmed of their epithelium with a tissue scissors, leaving 3 \nto 6 mm of connective tissue attached to the bone core. A \nmallet and blunt instrument should be used to tap it into \nplace and compress the bony core to conform to the crestal \ncontour of the socket. The connective tissue portion of \nthe graft is then sutured to the surrounding gingival tissue \nwith facial and palatal interrupted 4-0 Vicryl sutures. A \nremovable transitional prosthesis should not be permitted to \nload the tissue during the irst few weeks after extraction; \notherwise, the composite graft may become mobile and \nsequestrate. The transfer of the bone graft with an intact \nperiosteal layer expedites revascularization and may decrease \nthe healing time.50,51 As a result, reentry may be in 4 to 5 \nmonths, and placement of an ideal implant diameter is often \nmade possible.\nTwo to Three Bony Wall Defects. A two to three bony \nwall defect is treated very similarly to a four bony wall \ndefect. However, because the defect size is larger, more auto-\ngraft is required in the bone graft. Rather than using the \nautograft primarily in the crestal region, it is of beneit that \nthe entire irst layer of the resorbable graft materials be an \nautograft. As a consequence, more often a donor site from \nthe mandible is required. The most common two to three \nbony wall defects are extraction sites missing more than the \nlabial bony wall. Because the mesial distal bony walls are \nusually present, the host site is more predictable than a one \nbony wall defect. Incision line opening is less of a complica-\ntion because the residual ridge form has soft tissue support \naround the defect.\nOne Bony Wall Defects.

The procedure is less at risk when \nthe GBR is for width only, not for both width and height. \nThe technique is very similar to that already presented. The \nosteotomy of the implant site is prepared to the opposing \nlandmark (when possible), and the bone debris is harvested \nfrom the drills. The implant length does not need to be as \ndeep as the osteotomy, but the extra depth allows more bone \nto be harvested. Holes in the cortical bone distal to the \nimplant (not directly over the intact lateral bone), tent \nscrews, autograft, the second layer of demineralized freeze \ndried bone (DFDB) (30%), freeze dried bone (FDB) (70%), \nplatelet rich plasma (PRP), and the top of the graft are \ncovered with a barrier membrane with primary closure of \nthe soft tissue. The most dificult part of GBR at the time of \nimplant insertion is to ensure that the implant is positioned \nfor the prosthesis without compromise, rather than posi-\ntioned more palatal (lingual) or angled to engage more host \nbone. The position of the implant should not be compro-\nmised so as to improve the success of the bone graft or to \nimprove the osteointegration rate. The implants are useful \nfor the prosthesis, not the bone graft. When the implant \ncannot be inserted in the correct position (in all three planes) \nbecause of the inadequate host bone, only the bone graft \nshould be performed. Only after graft maturity can the \nimplant be inserted. It should be noted that in the anterior \nregions of the mouth the GBR procedure (with acellular \ndermal matrix) is used over the labial plate whenever it is \nless than 1.5 mm thick. This reduces the risk of marginal \nbone loss on the facial, which would result in shrinkage or \nrecessing of the soft tissue at the cervical of the implant \ncrown (Fig. 14.14).\nThe GBR procedure may be used when an implant is \nimmediately placed after a tooth extraction when conditions \npermit the implant to be positioned without compromise to \nthe prosthesis. The osteotomy for the implant is made to the \nopposing landmark. The autograft is positioned over the \nimplant and completely ills the extraction defect. The \nsecond layer of graft material is placed over the facial thin or \nmissing bone. The barrier membrane is placed over the \nmissing (or thin) bony wall, usually the facial. When a facial \nplate of the bone is missing, primary closure of the soft \ntissue is preferred (Fig. 14.15). Inability to maintain primary \nclosure will directly inluence the success of the bone graft \n(Figs. 14.16 and 14.17).\nInability to Achieve Primary Stability\nImplant stability plays an important role in determining \ntreatment outcome.54 Primary stability is the absence of \nmobility in the bone after the implant has been placed.

With anterior \nsingle-rooted teeth, using bone beyond the apex and the \nlateral engagement of the some or all of the tooth socket walls \nis instrumental in obtaining suficient primary stability. With \nposterior implants, vital structures such as the inferior alveo-\nlar nerve and the maxillary sinus limit stability derived from \nbone beyond the tooth apices. Furthermore, the limited \nnative bone present undergoes remodeling after the surgical \ntrauma of osteotomy preparation and implant insertion. \nThis trauma leads to a weakening of the bone-implant inter-\nface and may have an adverse effect on implant stability. \nOften, inadequate primary stability may only manifest itself \nafter 4 to 6 weeks; the bone interface is stronger on the day \nof implant placement compared with 3 months later. The \nsurgical process of the implant osteotomy preparation and \nimplant insertion cause a regional acceleratory phenomenon \nof bone repair around the implant interface. As a result of the \nsurgical placement, organized, mineralized lamellar bone in \nthe preparation site becomes unorganized, less mineralized, \nwoven bone of repair next to the implant. The implant-bone \ninterface is weakest and most at risk of overload at 3 to 6 \nweeks after surgical insertion because the surgical trauma \ncauses bone remodeling at the interface that is least mineral-\nized and unorganized during this time frame. A clinical \nreport by Buchs et al23 found immediately loaded implant \nfailure occurred primarily between 3 and 5 weeks after \nimplant insertion from mobility without infection. At 4 \nmonths the bone is still only 60% mineralized, organized \nlamellar bone. With time, bone formation and mineralization \nwill lead to increased interlocking with the implant surface \nand a stronger implant/bone interface. However, this has \nproved to be suficient in most bone types and clinical situa-\ntions for two-stage healing and delayed implant loading. The \nrelative lack of native bone (compared to a healed site) sug-\ngests the osteotomy should frequently be undersized in width, \nthe degree of which is dependent on bone density. In addi-\ntion, for less dense bone, immediate implant ixation can be \nfacilitated if the clinician can use osteotomes for radial \ncompaction.\nDependent on tooth socket size and anatomy, suficient \nimplant stability can sometimes be achieved by lateral wall \nengagement only. Extending the osteotomy 3 to 5 mm past \nthe socket apex (without encroaching on vital structures) is \nmore commonly done for primary stability.61\nClinically Conirm Primary Stability. Accurate assessment \nof primary stability is crucial in the immediate placement \nprotocol. Methods of measuring implant stability include the \npercussion testing, insertion torque (IT), percussion testing, \nreverse torque testing, resonance frequency analysis (RFA), \nand surgical experience. Instrumented percussion testing has \nutilized the Periotest system. Periotest evaluations have been \nuseful to gauge primary stability.55,63,64 It is composed of a \nmetallic tapping rod in a handpiece, which is electromagneti-\ncally driven and electronically controlled. Signals produced \nby tapping are converted to unique values called Periotest \nthe interradicular septum. A Lindemann bur is very useful \nfor initiating and modifying osteotomies. The objective of \nthis multiplane preparation process is to create an osteotomy \nin a prosthetically correct position without compromising \nthe buccal wall of bone.\nUnderprepare Osteotomy Width and Over Prepare Oste-\notomy Length. Misch initially outlined a protocol that adapts \nthe treatment plan, implant selection, surgical approach, \nhealing regimen, and initial prosthetic loading to all bone \ndensities and all arch positions and that resulted in similar \nimplant success for all bone densities.6 To assist in bone \nquality evaluation, Cavallero advises clinicians to determine \nthe degree of osseous density with a 2-millimeter twist drill \nand describes ways in which they can use this information to \nalter osteotomy development and subsequent prosthetic \ndesign.62 These concepts can also be applied to immediate \nimplant placement.\nFIG 14.17 (A) Incision line opening with complete exposure \nof cover screw after 6 months.

Interestingly, IT \nand RFA appear as two independent features of primary sta-\nbility. Data in a study by Degidi showed that IT is only inlu-\nenced by bone density and that RFA is only correlated to the \nlength of implants used.69 Insertion torque values also have \nshown good correlation with calibrated bone mineral density \nvalues as assessed through CT scans70 and may be considered \nas a valid measure for determining bone quality at an implant \nsite. Some studies have determined that implant stability \nassociated with torque values of 32, 35, 40 N/cm and higher \nare preferred thresholds for immediate loading.55,71,72\nResonance Frequency Analysis (RFA) (Fig. 14.18) is a \ntesting method that provides objective and reliable measure-\nments of lateral micromobility at various stages of the implant \ntreatment process. The method analyzes the irst resonance \nvalues. These results are expressed in arbitrary units with \nacceptable Periotest values in the ranges of −4 to −2 and −4 \nto +2.55 This device has been supplanted by RFA due to the \nlack of reproducibility of results derived from Periotest mea-\nsurements. These measurements are subject to a number of \nfactors such as the vertical position of the measuring point \non the abutment, angulation of the handpiece, and horizontal \ndistance of the handpiece from the abutment.65\nReverse torque testing (RTT) has been said to be beneicial \nat stage II surgery as a deinitive clinical veriication of initial \nintegration66 or “adequacy” of the implant-bone interface.67 \nGiven the potential for early crestal bone loss and early \nimplant failure as a result of this test, especially in less dense \nbone types, RTT is not advisable for evaluating healed bone-\nimplant interfaces.68 This author has found a variation of \nRTT useful in the determination of suficient primary ixa-\ntion.

It can be used to monitor the changes in stiffness \nand stability at the implant-tissue interface and to discrimi-\nnate between successful implants and clinical failures. Inte-\ngration diagnostics developed the Implant Stability Quotient \n(ISQ) as a scale of measurement for use with the RFA method. \nThis more objective assessment of stability may help improve \na clinician’s learning curve and is useful for future compari-\nson. Multiple studies73,74 have determined that an acceptable \nstability range lies between 55 and 85 ISQ, with an average \nISQ level of 70.75\nThe information provided by RFA is useful; however, the \nclinician should be wary of relying completely on a general \nstandardized range of ISQ readings due to variations that \nmay exist for different implant designs and surface conditions \nas well as the inability to correlate RFA with histomorpho-\nmetric data of bone anchorage or with the torque required to \ntap the bone for implant placement. The study concluded \nthat validity of the individual measurement of implant stabil-\nity using RFA should be considered with caution because the \nboundary height, width, and density factors can inluence the \nresonance frequency of dental implants. However, there is no \nclinical study today that proves the RFA level for implants \nsurviving long-term and the necessary minimum RFA thresh-\nold needed for the success of immediate loaded (IL) implants. \nThese data seem to conirm that RFA and IT represent two \ndifferent features of primary stability, with the irst indicating \nthe resistance to bending load and the latter indicating the \nresistance to shear forces.76\nDegiti conducted a clinical study to (1) evaluate the Osstell \nas a diagnostic tool capable of discriminating between stable \nand mobile ITI (Straumann) implants, (2) to evaluate a \nthreshold ISQ value obtained at implant placement (ISQitv) \nthat might be predictive of osseointegration when assessed \nafter 1 year of loading, and (3) to compare the predictive \nISQitv of IL and DL implants. Degidi’s study in 2006 demon-\nstrated a surgeon’s capability to predict IT but at the same \ntime have poor accuracy in prediction of RFA values. Despite \nthese indings, an experienced surgeon’s perception of primary \nstability under no circumstances should be discounted.75\nImplant design and initial stability. The clinical percep-\ntion of primary implant stability is frequently based on the \ncutting resistance of the implant during its insertion. The \nfeeling of “good” stability may be accentuated if there is \nthe sense of an abrupt stop at the seating of the implant. \nAlthough root form tapered implants often have a geometry \nthat will provide a irm stop, the resultant stability may be a \nfalse perception.77 In addition, in a tapered, threaded implant, \nthreads at the apical half are often less deep because the outer \ndiameter of the implant body continues to decrease. This \nlimits the initial ixation of the implant and further reduces \nthe functional surface area. For immediate implant place-\nment, the tapered/conical body design may be of beneit \nduring initial insertion because it is positioned within the \nosteotomy halfway before engaging bone.36 The choice of \nimplant body with regard to primary stabilization is equivo-\ncal and may be more inluenced by osteotomy preparation \nthan implant body design. A study by Sakoh concluded the \ncombination of both conical implant design and the proce-\ndure of underdimensioned drilling appeared to be associated \nwith increased primary stability.78\nTreatment Options\nBone Density. Dependent on bone density, the implant can \nsometimes be redirected into more dense bone; the redirec-\ntion may be needed in more than one plane and kept within \nthe needed three-dimensional boundaries for prosthetic \nreconstruction. Often a subtle tap of the (threaded) implant \nin an axial direction will gain the needed initial primary \nstability without putting the implant at risk from excessive \napical positioning relative to the osseous crest and any \nadjacent teeth. A straight or offset osteotome can be utilized \n(Fig. 14.19).\nUse of Larger Implant. The dimensions, longer and/or \nwider, of the “rescue” implant may allow for satisfactory \nprimary ixation; however, it must still be in an acceptable \nposition in relation to the crestal bone, adjacent teeth, and \nplanned inal prosthesis.79 This may be placed in a redirected \nmanner described above. An increased implant surface area \ncan engage more cortical bone. It has also been shown in \nan experimental study in rabbit tibia that wider implant \ndiameters resulted in increased removal torque values.80 \nMatsushita et al81 employed a two-dimensional inite element \nmethod to analyze the effect of different implant diameters \non stress distribution within the alveolar bone using \nHA-coated implants. They found that stress in cortical bone \ndecreased with increased implant diameter. Ivanhoff, however, \nreported a lower survival rate and a tendency for higher bone \nloss for 5.0-mm diameter implants, as compared to 3.75-mm- \nor 4.0-mm diameter implants.82 Resultant decreased facial \nbone dimensions associated with wider implant dimensions \nincrease the probability of soft tissue recession.\nLeave Implant in Place. An implant with loss of rotational \nstability (spinner) and minimal, if any, surrounding ridge \ndeiciencies may be left in place. If replacement is not possible \n(for example, in cases of inadequate bone dimensions or \nwhere a larger implant is unavailable), the surgeon must then \ndecide whether to leave the implant in place or remove it and \nreevaluate the site for further implant therapy after healing is \ncomplete. Some studies have found that primary stability, \nwhile desirable, may not be an absolute requirement to \nachieve and maintain osseointegration.83\nIvanhoff reported osseointegrated implants that have been \nmobilized due to a traumatic disruption of the bone-implant \ninterface may reintegrate if allowed to heal for an additional \nperiod of time.84 Orenstein reported a 79.8% survival rate \nafter 3 years of implants that were mobile at placement. A \nsigniicant factor for most of these implants was the presence \nof a HA coating. Almost one half of the noncoated, initially \nmobile, implants failed by 3 years postplacement. Even if \ninitially mobile implants are found to integrate, precautions \nare advised to avoid implant overload. Clinicians may want"

Both showed \nsimilar clinical characteristics, although the implants placed \nwith the immediate protocol demonstrated a higher tendency \nfor crestal bone loss and incidence of peri-implantitis.90\nLang found a high survival rate although soft tissue issues \nwere apparent.5 In particular, soft tissue recession was found \nto be associated with thin tissue biotype, facial malposition-\ning, and/or a thin or damaged buccal bone plate (Figs. 14.22 \nand 14.23). About 20% of patients who underwent immedi-\nate implant placement and delayed restorations suffered from \nsuboptimal aesthetic outcomes due to buccal soft tissue reces-\nsion in studies with observation period of 3 years or more.\nSUMMARY\nImplant placement in general involves multiple steps and \ndecision points. As a distinct procedure, the technique of \nimmediate implant placement adds multiple additional deci-\nsion points, making it a technique-sensitive modality. It can \nhave equivalent success rates to staged implant placement if \nthe implant surgeon has an awareness of the potential pitfalls \nand the ability to deal with its unique complications.\nPreoperative communication with the patient regarding \nposttreatment expectations, treatment phasing, and appro-\npriate choice of pharmacologic agents can help minimize or \neliminate this sequela. Not infrequently, removal of a tooth \nas part of treatment may place some of the remaining teeth \nin traumatic occlusion. Occlusal adjustment via selective \ngrinding frequently results in rapid resolution of this problem. \nAlthough not a frequent occurrence, the clinician should \nalways be aware of patients whose histories suggest they may \npresent with atypical facial pain.86\nPATIENT MANAGEMENT: MEDICOLEGAL \nCONSIDERATIONS\nWhen anticipating immediate implant placement, the patient \nshould be informed that the procedure may need to be \naborted with only a bone graft placed. The surgeon does not \nwant to compromise a 30-year prosthesis simply to avoid \nwaiting an additional 3 to 6 months.6\nINCISION LINE OPENING\nPrimary closure is typically desired when attempting regen-\neration in other than simple three-wall defects (with or \nwithout the presence of an implant). Incision line opening \n(ILO) following implant placement and simultaneous \ncomplex augmentation can have a devastating outcome, \nwhereas, in other cases, primary closure is not necessary \ndependent on the defect size and anatomy (see Fig. 14.14). \nStrategies for ILO management are discussed in Chapter 11: \nWound Dehiscence: Incision Line Opening. Although some \nauthors describe the need for primary lap closure, survival of \nimplants is not dependent on primary closure in all cases.87,88\nCOMPLICATIONS FOLLOWING FIRST STAGE\nBONE HEALING\nCompromised Implant Position\nThis common complication of immediate implant place-\nment may not be readily apparent until the restorative \nprocess has been initiated (Fig. 14.21). For this discussion, \ncare must be taken to distinguish between a compromise(s) \nthat could be present following a delayed/two-staged proce-\ndure (e.g., increased inal crown height) vs. a compromise \nthat could be solely attributed to implant placement at \nthe time of extraction. Examples of the later are character-\nized by excessive positions in one or more of the potential \nthree reference planes. Nonideal positioning can also result \nafter multistage procedures; however, the need for native \nbone for primary stability in immediate placement cases \nincreases the likelihood of positioning error. Management of \ncases with resultant excessive mesial-distal space/length can \nbe frequently treated by placement of additional (usually \nnarrower-diameter) implants.

There is a distinct overall trend \ntoward a decrease in edentulism; however, the group in need \nof this rehabilitation is rapidly growing. It has been estimated \nover the past 30 years there has been a 10% decrease in eden-\ntulism. However, this has been offset by an increase of 79% \nin the adult population over 55 years of age.1 According to \nthe literature, age is directly related to tooth loss.2 This aging \npopulation is an important factor when evaluating the need \nfor removable implant-retained prostheses. With tooth loss \nin this age group, many negative consequences related to \nconventional dentures such as decreased masticatory func-\ntion, systemic consequences, patient dissatisfaction, and \nspeech and psychologic effects may result (Box 15.1).\nWith the growing number of implants being placed, even \nwith the advances that have been seen in implant dentistry, \ncomplications do occur with implant-retained removable \nprostheses. The complications may arise from the treatment \nplanning phase, implant positioning, implant number, selec-\ntion of attachments, and the insertion of the prosthesis. This \nchapter discusses various complications that may arise with \nimplant-retained removable prostheses and various tech-\nniques to prevent and treat the complications if they occur \n(Fig. 15.1 and Fig. 15.2).\nCOMPLICATIONS OF OVERDENTURES FOR \nTHE EDENTULOUS PATIENT\nNOT UNDERSTANDING THE \nDISADVANTAGES OF EDENTULISM\nWhen evaluating an edentulous patient, it is the clinician’s \nresponsibility to explain to the patient the disadvantages that \nmay result from edentulism. The following are consequences \nof edentulism that play a signiicant role in treatment \nplanning (Box 15.2).\nContinued Bone Loss\nOne of the most common issues of edentulism that is not com-\nmonly explained to patients is the continued loss of bone. \nAlveolar bone requires constant stimulation to maintain its \nform, strength and density. Roberts et al reported that a 4% \nstrain to the skeletal system maintains bone and helps balance \nthe resorption and formation phenomena.3 The forces applied \nto teeth transmit compressive and tensile forces to the sur-\nrounding bone. However, when a tooth is lost, the lack of stim-\nulation to the residual bone causes a decrease in trabeculae and \nbone density in the area, with loss in external width, then height \nof the bone volume.4 Studies have shown a 25% decrease in \nwidth of bone during the irst year after tooth loss and an \noverall 4-mm decrease in height during the irst year after \nextractions for an immediate denture.5 In a longitudinal 25-year \nstudy of edentulous patients, Tallgren demonstrated continued \nbone loss during this time span, with a fourfold greater loss \nobserved in the mandible.6 In 1963 Atwood introduced ive \ndifferent stages of bone loss in an anterior mandible after tooth \nloss showing the resorptive process over time.7 Even though the \nmandibular bone resorbs faster than the maxillary bone, the \nmandible has almost twice the bone initially available.\nWhen patients wear a removable prosthesis, the bone is \nnot stimulated in the same fashion that a tooth does. The load \nplaced on the removable prosthesis is transferred to the bone \nsurface, not the internal structure of the bone. This causes the \nblood supply to be reduced to the bone resulting in total bone \nvolume being lost.8 The bone loss accelerates when the patient \nwears a poorly itting soft tissue–borne prosthesis. The \naverage denture wearer sees a dental professional approxi-\nmately every 14.8 years after having a complete denture. \nIdeally, edentulous patients should be seen every 1 to 2 years \nand should be informed that every 3 to 5 years a reline or new \ndenture is suggested to replace the additional bone loss by \natrophy that naturally will occur.\nThe rate and amount of bone loss may be inluenced by \nmany factors such as gender, hormones, metabolism, para-\nfunction, and ill-itting dentures. Studies have shown almost \n40% of denture wearers have been wearing an ill-itting pros-\nthesis for more than 10 years.9 Patients wearing dentures day \nand night place greater forces on the hard and soft tissues, \nwhich accelerates bone loss. Nonetheless, 80% of dentures are \nworn both day and night.9 Loss of bone in the maxilla or \nmandible is not limited to alveolar bone; portions of the basal \nbone may also be resorbed, especially in the posterior aspect \nof the mandible, where severe resorption may result in the \nmental foramen or mandibular canal becoming dehiscent. \nThis may result in signiicant pain and discomfort, leading to \nthe inability to wear a removable prosthesis. In the maxilla, \nthe complete anterior ridge and nasal spine may be resorbed, \ncausing pain and an increase in maxillary denture movement \nduring function (Fig. 15.3 and Box 15.3).10"

The difference in maximum occlusal forces \nrecorded in a patient with natural teeth and one who is com-\npletely edentulous is dramatic. In the irst molar region of a \ndentate person, the average force has been measured to be \napproximately 150 to 250 psi.11 A parafunction patient who \ngrinds or clenches their teeth may exert a force that approaches \n1000 psi. In edentulous patients the maximum occlusal force \napproaches less than 50 psi. This is very important when \nexplaining various treatment plans to patients, especially with \nexpectations. The longer patients are edentulous, the less \nocclusal force they are able to generate. Studies have shown \nthat patients wearing complete dentures for more than 15 \nyears have been shown to exhibit a maximum occlusal force \nof less than 6 psi.12 This is a signiicant disadvantage that \npatients need to be educated about, especially when patients \ndecline implant treatment plans in favor of conventional \nremovable dentures. In comparison, the maximum occlusal \nforce may improve upwards of 300% with an implant-\nsupported prosthesis.13\nDecreased Masticatory Eficiency\nAs a result of decreased occlusal force and the instability of the \ncomplete denture, masticatory eficiency will decrease with \ntooth loss.

In addition, the coarser bolus may impair \nproper digestive and nutrient extraction functions.16\nIncreased Soft Tissue Discomfort\nMandibular discomfort was listed in a study by Misch and \nMisch with equal frequency as movement (63.5%), and, sur-\nprisingly, 16.5% of the patients stated they never wear the \nmandibular denture. In comparison, the maxillary denture \nwas uncomfortable half as often (32.6%), and only 0.9% were \nseldom able to wear the prosthesis. Function was the fourth \nmost common problem reported by these 104 denture \nwearers. Half of the patients avoided many foods, and 17% \nclaimed they were able to masticate more effectively without \nthe prostheses. The psychologic effects of the inability to eat \nin public can be correlated with these indings. Other reports \nagree that the major motivating factors for patients to undergo \nimplant-related treatment were related to the dificulties with \neating, denture it, and discomfort.15\nSystemic Consequences\nThe literature includes several reports suggesting that com-\npromised dental function causes poor masticatory perfor-\nmance and swallowing poorly chewed food, which in turn \nmay inluence systemic changes favoring illness, debilitation, \nand shortened life expectancy.17,18 In a study evaluating the \nability to eat fruit, vegetables, and other dietary iber in eden-\ntulous subjects, 10% claimed dificulty, and blood tests dem-\nonstrated reduced levels of plasma ascorbate and plasma \nretinol compared with dentate subjects. These two blood tests \nare correlated to an increased risk of dermatologic and visual \nproblems in aging adults. In another study the masticatory \nperformance and eficiency in denture wearers were com-\npared with those of dentate individuals. This report noted \nthat, when appropriate corrections were made for different \nperformance norms and levels, the chewing eficiency of a \ndenture wearer was less than one sixth of a person with teeth.19\nSeveral reports in the literature correlate a patient’s health \nand life span to dental health. Poor chewing ability may be a \ncause of involuntary weight loss in the elderly population, \nwith an increase in mortality rate.20 In contrast, persons with \na substantial number of missing teeth were more likely to be \nobese. After conventional risk factors for strokes and heart \nattacks were accounted for, there was a signiicant relation-\nship between dental disease and cardiovascular disease, the \nlatter still remaining as the major cause of death.21 It is logical \nto assume that restoring the stomatognathic system of these \npatients to a more normal function may indeed enhance the \nquality and length of their lives.\nLack of Prosthesis Satisfaction\nA dental survey of edentulous patients found that 66% were \ndissatisied with their mandibular complete dentures. Primary \nreasons were discomfort and lack of retention causing pain \nand discomfort. Past dental health surveys indicate that only \n80% of the edentulous population are able to wear both \nremovable prostheses all the time. Some patients wear only \none prosthesis, usually the maxillary; others are only able to \nFIG 15.3 A dentate mandible (left) and a long-term edentu-\nlous mandible on the (right). Note the amount of bone loss \nin height. Loss of bone height in the mandible may be mea-\nsured by the centimeter and often is ignored. Such bone loss \nis often more signiicant than the bone loss (in millimeters) \nfrom periodontal disease. The patient should understand that \na denture often replaces more bone than teeth to restore the \nproper dimensions of the face. (From Misch CE: Dental \nimplant prosthetics, ed 2, St Louis, 2015, Mosby.)\nBOX 15.3 Anatomic Consequences \nof Edentulism\n• Decreased width of denture-supporting bone\n• Decreased height of denture-supporting bone\n• Prominent mylohyoid and internal oblique ridges with \nincrease in denture sore spots\n• Progressive decrease in keratinized attached mucosa\n• Prominent superior genial tubercles with increased denture \nmovement\n• Muscle attachments near crest of edentulous ridge\n• Posterior elevation of prosthesis with contraction of mylo-\nhyoid and buccinator muscles during function\n• Forward movement of prosthesis from anatomic inclina-\ntion with moderate to advanced bone loss\n• Thinning of surface mucosa with increased sensitivity to \nabrasion\n• Loss of basal bone\n• Paresthesia from dehiscent mental foramen and neurovas-\ncular canal\n• Increased risk of mandibular body fracture from advanced \nbone loss\nin the patient wearing complete dentures.12 A study of 367 \ndenture wearers (158 men and 209 women) found that 47% \nexhibited a low masticatory performance.14 In patients with \ndentures, 29% are able to eat only soft or mashed foods, 50% \navoid many foods, and 17% claim they eat more eficiently \nwithout the prosthesis.15 Lower intakes of fruits, vegetables, \nand vitamin A by women were noted in this group. Denture \npatients also take signiicantly more drugs (37%) compared \nwith those with superior masticatory ability (20%), and 28% \ntake medications for gastrointestinal disorders.

A primary reason to consider \ndental implants to replace missing teeth is the maintenance \nof alveolar bone. It is well accepted that dental implants \nplaced in the anterior mandible help retain a lower denture \nand are a beneit over a complete denture. However, the pos-\nterior bone loss will continue and may eventually lead to \nsigniicant complications. Instead, when suficient implants \nare inserted, the restoration is not only retained but it also is \ncompletely supported and stabilized off the tissue and bone. \nThe implants also stimulate and maintain the bone of the \nmandible as well as serve as an anchor for the prosthetic \ndevice. As a result, dental implants are one of the better pre-\nventive maintenance procedures available in dentistry.\nMore Ideal Occlusion\nOne of the main complications of wearing a lower removable \ndenture is the associated movement and lack of security. A \nmandibular denture often moves when the mylohyoid and \nbuccinator muscles contract during speech or mastication. \nOcclusion is dificult to establish and stabilize with a com-\npletely soft tissue–supported prosthesis. Because the man-\ndibular prosthesis may move as much as 10 mm or more \nduring function, proper occlusal contacts occur by chance, \nnot by design. In comparison, an implant-supported restora-\ntion is much more stable.25 The patient can more consistently \nreturn to centric relation occlusion rather than adopt variable \npositions dictated by the prosthesis’ instability. Propriocep-\ntion is awareness of a structure in time and place. The recep-\ntors in the periodontal membrane of the natural tooth help \ndetermine its occlusal position. Although endosteal implants \ndo not have a periodontal membrane, they provide greater \nocclusal awareness than complete dentures. Whereas patients \nwith natural teeth can perceive a difference of 20 µm between \nthe teeth, implant patients can determine a 50-µm difference \nwith rigid implant bridges compared with 100 µm in those \nwith complete dentures (either one or two).26 As a result of \nimproved occlusal awareness, the patient functions in a more \nconsistent range of occlusion. With an implant-supported \nprosthesis, the direction of the occlusal loads is controlled by \nthe restoring dentist. Horizontal forces on removable pros-\ntheses accelerate bone loss, decrease prosthesis stability, and \nincrease soft tissue abrasions.

In addition, approxi-\nmately 7% of patients are not able to wear their dentures at \nall and become “dental cripples” or “oral invalids.” They rarely \nleave their home environment, and when they feel forced to \nventure out, the thought of meeting and talking to people \nwhen not wearing their teeth is unsettling.22\nSpeech Dificulty\nA report of 104 completely edentulous patients seeking treat-\nment was performed by Misch and Misch. Of the patients \nstudied, 88% claimed dificulty with speech, with one fourth \nhaving great dificulty. The lower prosthesis rests upon the \nbuccinator muscle and mylohyoid muscle when the posterior \nmandible resorbs. When the patient opens their mouth, the \ncontraction of these muscles acts like a trampoline and \npropels the lower denture off the ridge. As a result, the teeth \noften click when the patient talks, not from too much of the \nvertical dimension restored but from the lack of stability and \nretention of the prosthesis. Speech problems may be associ-\nated with a concern for social activities. Awareness of move-\nment of the mandibular denture was cited by 62.5% of these \npatients, although the maxillary prosthesis stayed in place \nmost of the time at almost the same percentage.\nPsychologic Impact of Edentulism\nThe psychologic effects of total edentulism are complex and \nvaried and range from very minimal to a state of neuroticism. \nAlthough complete dentures are able to satisfy the esthetic \nneeds of many patients, some believe their social lives are \nsigniicantly affected. They are concerned with kissing and \nromantic situations, especially if a new partner in a relation-\nship is unaware of their oral handicap. Fiske et al, in a study \nof interviews with edentulous subjects, found tooth loss was \ncomparable to the death of a friend or loss of other important \nparts of a body in causing a reduction of self-conidence \nending in a feeling of shame or bereavement.23\nThe psychologic needs of edentulous patients are expressed \nin many forms. For example, in 1970, Britons used approxi-\nmately 88 tons of denture adhesive.24 In 1982, more than 5 \nmillion Americans used denture adhesives (Ruskin Denture \nResearch Associates: AIM study, unpublished data, 1982), and \na report shows that in the United States, more than $200 \nmillion is spent each year on denture adhesives, representing \n55 million units sold.27 Patients are willing to accept the \nunpleasant taste, need for recurring application, inconsistent \ndenture it, embarrassing circumstances, and continued \nexpense for the sole beneit of increased retention of the \nprosthesis. Clearly, the lack of retention and psychologic risk \nof embarrassment in the denture wearer with removable \nprostheses is a concern the dental profession must address.\nADVANTAGES OF AN IMPLANT-SUPPORTED \nPROSTHESIS (BOX 15.4)\nMaintenance of Existing Bone\nThe use of dental implants to provide support for prostheses \noffers many advantages compared with the use of removable \nBOX 15.4 Advantages of an Implant-\nSupported Prosthesis\n• Maintenance of existing bone\n• More ideal occlusion\n• Increased masticatory function\n• Less morbidity in comparison to teeth\n• Increased biting force\n• Increased retention and stability\n• Enhanced phonetics\n• Improved psychologic health"

The tooth-supported overdenture loses \nonly 10% of chewing eficiency compared with natural teeth. \nThese indings are similar with implant-supported overden-\ntures. In addition, rigid, implant-supported ixed bridges may \nfunction the same as natural teeth.31\nImprovement of Retention and Stability\nStability and retention of an implant-supported prosthesis \nare great improvements over soft tissue–borne dentures. \nMechanical means of implant retention are far superior to \nthe soft tissue retention provided by dentures or adhesives \nand cause fewer associated problems. The implant support of \nthe inal prosthesis is variable, depending on the number and \nposition of implants, yet all treatment options demonstrate \nsigniicant improvement over conventional prosthesis treat-\nment options.\nEnhanced Phonetics\nPhonetics may be impaired by the instability of a conven-\ntional denture. The buccinator and mylohyoid muscles may \nlex and propel the posterior portion of the denture upward, \ncausing clicking, regardless of the vertical dimension. As a \nresult, a patient in whom the vertical dimension already has \ncollapsed 10 to 20 mm may still produce clicking sounds \nduring speech. Often the tongue of the denture wearer is lat-\ntened in the posterior areas to hold the denture in position. \nThe anterior mandibular muscles of facial expression may be \ntightened to prevent the mandibular prosthesis from sliding \nforward. The implant prosthesis is stable and retentive and \ndoes not require these oral manipulations. The implant res-\ntoration allows reduced langes or palates of the prostheses. \nThis is of special beneit to new denture wearers, who often \nreport discomfort with the bulk of the restoration. The \nextended soft tissue coverage also affects the taste of food, and \nthe soft tissue may be tender in the extended regions. The \npalate of a maxillary prosthesis may cause gagging in some \npatients, which can be eliminated in an implant-supported \noverdenture.\nImproved Psychologic Health\nPatients treated with implant-supported prostheses judge \ntheir overall psychologic health as improved by 80% com-\npared with their previous state while wearing traditional, \nremovable prosthodontic devices. They perceived the \nimplant-supported prosthesis as an integral part of their \nbody.32 For example, Raghoebar et al evaluated 90 edentulous \npatients in a randomized multicenter study. Five years after \ntreatment, a validated questionnaire targeted patient esthetic \nsatisfaction, retention, comfort, and the ability to speak and \neat with either a complete mandibular denture, complete \nmandibular denture with vestibuloplasty, or mandibular two-\nimplant overdenture. Implant overdentures had signiicantly \nhigher ratings, but no signiicant difference was found \nbetween the two complete-denture groups.33 Geertman et al \nreported similar results comparing chewing ability of con-\nventional complete dentures with mandibular implant \noverdentures.34\nIncreased Masticatory Function\nIn a randomized clinical trial comparing conventional vs. \nimplant-supported prostheses by Kapur et al, the implant \ngroup of patients demonstrated a higher level of eating \nenjoyment and improvement of speech, chewing ability, \ncomfort, denture security, and overall satisfaction.27 The \nability to eat several different foods among complete \ndenture vs. mandibular overdenture patients was evaluated \nby Awad and Feine. The implant overdenture was superior \nfor eating not only harder foods, such as carrots and apples, \nbut also softer foods, such as bread and cheese. Geertman \net al evaluated complete denture wearers with severely \nresorbed mandibles before and after mandibular implant \noverdentures. The ability to eat hard or tough foods signii-\ncantly improved.28\nResearchers at McGill University evaluated blood levels of \npatients who had complete dentures and 30 maxillary den-\ntures and mandibular implant prostheses 6 months after \ntreatment. Within this rather short period, implant patients \nhad higher vitamin B12 hemoglobin (related to iron increase) \nand albumin levels (related to nutrition). These patients also \nhad greater body fat in their shoulders and arms, with \ndecreased body fat in their waists.29\nLess Morbidity in Comparison to Teeth\nThe success rate of implant prostheses varies depending on a \nhost of factors that change for each patient. However, com-\npared with traditional methods of tooth replacement, the \nimplant prosthesis offers increased longevity, improved func-\ntion, bone preservation, and better psychologic results. \nAccording to 10-year survival surveys of ixed prostheses on \nnatural teeth, decay is indicated as the most frequent reason \nfor replacement; and survival rates are approximately 75%.30 \nIn a partially edentulous patient, independent tooth replace-\nment with implants may preserve intact adjacent natural \nteeth as abutments, further limiting complications such as \ndecay or endodontic therapy, which are the most common \ncauses of ixed prosthesis failure. A major advantage of the \nimplant-supported prosthesis is that the abutments cannot \ndecay and never will require endodontics. The implant and \nrelated prosthesis have been shown to attain a 10-year sur-\nvival rate of more than 90%.\nIncreased Biting Force\nPatients with an implant-supported ixed prosthesis may \nincrease their maximum bite force by 85% within 2 months \nafter the completion of treatment. After 3 years the mean \nforce may reach more than 300% compared with pretreat-\nment values. As a result, an implant prosthesis wearer may \ndemonstrate a force similar to that of a patient with a ixed \nrestoration supported by natural teeth. Chewing eficiency \nwith an implant prosthesis is greatly improved compared \nwith that of a soft tissue–borne restoration. The masticatory \nperformance of dentures, overdentures, and natural dentition \nwere evaluated by Rissin et al. The traditional denture showed \na 30% decrease in chewing eficiency; other reports indicate \na denture wearer has less than 60% of the function of people"

The patient \nshould be informed at the beginning of treatment of the need \nfor maintenance to avoid patient complications. Although the \ninitial cost of treatment may be less for an IOD, overdenture \nwearers often incur greater long-term expenses than those \nwith ixed restorations. Attachments (i.e., O-rings or clips) \nregularly wear and must be replaced, which in some cases is \nvery time consuming. Walton and McEntee noted there were \nthree times more maintenance and adjustments issues for \noverdentures compared with ixed restorations.37\nFood Impaction\nA common complaint with IODs is food impaction under the \nprosthesis. When the denture is fabricated, border molding \ncaptures the muscles in their contracted position. In the \nrelaxed muscle state, food will sometimes become displaced \nunder the denture border. For example, when the patient \nswallows, the food is pushed under the denture. Because the \nIOD moves less than a denture, the food remains under the \nIOD and becomes lodged, usually requiring the patient to \nphysically remove the irritants (Fig. 15.6).\nLoss of Posterior Bone\nMost mandibular IODs used by the profession are supported \nby implants anterior to the mental foramina and soft tissue \nsupport in the posterior regions. The anterior implants allow \nimproved anterior bone maintenance, and the prosthesis \nNOT UNDERSTANDING THE \nDISADVANTAGES OF A REMOVABLE \nIMPLANT PROSTHESIS (OVERDENTURE)\nAlthough dental implant overdentures are successful in many \nsituations, patients should be informed of the inherent dis-\nadvantages and complications that may occur. Many studies \nhave shown a rather high incidence of complications. \nGoodacre et al have shown overdenture complications to \ninclude clip/attachment loosening (30%), clip/attachment \nfracture (17%), and overdenture fracture (12%). In a study \nby Bilhan et al on 59 patients, two thirds of implant-supported \noverdenture (IOD) patients had prosthetic-related complica-\ntions the irst year. For example, relines were necessary in \n16%, loss of retention in 10.2%, fracture of the IOD in 8.5%, \npressure spots in 8.5%, dislodged attachment in 6.8%, and \nscrew loosening in 3.4%.35 Other studies have shown up to \n18% of overdentures requiring a reline of the prosthesis \nwithin the irst year.36 It is imperative that patients under-\nstand fully the basis and long-term issues that may be associ-\nated with implant-retained overdentures.\nNot a Fixed Prosthesis\nMany patients are not educated in the inherent mechanics of \noverdentures and the various levels of support that exist, \nwhich are dependent on the position, number, and types of \nretentive mechanisms. The most common misconception \nthat may lead to patient disapproval is an overdenture is not \na “ixed prosthesis.” With that, the patient must understand \nthe decreased occlusal force in comparison to ixed prosthesis. \nAn overdenture is considered a prosthesis, whereas a ixed \nprosthesis is considered a body part. Fixed implant prostheses \nare often considered by patients to be similar to their natural \nteeth in esthetics and function. With an overdenture, move-\nment of the prosthesis is usually noted by the patient along \nwith decreased masticatory function (Fig. 15.4).\nNeed of Adequate Crown Height Space (CHS)\nA greater crown height space (CHS) is required for an \nimplant-retained overdenture in comparison to other types \nof implant prostheses. With an overdenture prosthesis, there \nis often a lack of space that results in a prosthesis fracture or \nloss of denture teeth. When space is compromised, inade-\nquate room results in modiication of the materials (reduc-\ntion of acrylic from denture base or hollowing out of denture \nteeth) to obtain room for attachment mechanisms. In these \nsituations, the appropriate attachment (e.g., Locator 6–low \nproile) must be selected to minimize these complications. \nWhen abundant bone is present and implants are already \ninserted, a compromised CHS may indicate a change in treat-\nment planning to a ixed prosthesis if adequate number and \nposition of implants are present (Fig. 15.5).\nMaintenance\nAn increased maintenance protocol is often required for an \noverdenture. Denture teeth wear more rapidly on an IOD in \ncomparison to a denture (i.e., increased occlusal force). As a \nFIG 15.4 (A) Fixed prosthesis, which exhibits greater mastica-\ntory eficiency.

Stability: stability of a prosthesis is evaluated with hori-\nzontal or cantilevered forces applied to the restoration. \nThe stability of the IOD is more related to implant (attach-\nment and bar) position. This is often a misconception of \npatients because they believe there should exist no move-\nment of the prosthesis.\nTreat According to Patient’s Desires. The patient’s initial \ncomplaints, hard and soft tissue anatomy, prosthetic desires, \nand inancial commitment determine the amount of implant \nsupport, retention, and stability. Because different anatomic \nconditions and patient force factors inluence these factors \nfor an IOD, not all prostheses should be treated in the same \nmanner. In other words, the two-implant overdenture should \nnot be the only treatment plan offered to a patient. One \nshould emphasize that most mandibular overdentures should \nbe designed to eventually result in a RP-4 prosthesis (e.g., \ntotally implant supported). If the patient wishes for a less \nretentive prosthesis, a prosthesis with less support, and with \nminimal stability, the patient needs to understand the inher-\nent disadvantages. It is highly recommended that the clinician \nfurnish all patients with ALL possible overdenture treatment \nplans. This is important for two reasons. First, the patient will \nbe well aware of the type of prosthesis they have selected, and, \nsecondly, this allows for the patient to understand they can \n“upgrade” to a prosthesis at a later time that will have \nincreased retention, support, and stability. This will prevent \nunacceptable expectations from the patient following the \ninsertion of the prosthesis.\nUnderstand Prosthesis Movement. The most common \ncomplications found with mandibular IODs are related to the \nprosthetics and a misunderstanding of retention, support, \nand stability of the prosthesis. When a ixed restoration is \nfabricated on implants, it is rigid, and cantilevers or offset \nloads are clearly identiied. For example, rarely will a practi-\ntioner place a full-arch ixed restoration on three implants, \nespecially with excessive cantilevers because of implant posi-\ntioning. However, three anterior implants with a connecting \nbar may support a completely ixed overdenture, solely \nbecause of attachment design or placement. The restoring \nclinician believes the three-implant overdenture has less \nprosthetic occlusal load but does not realize that a three-\nimplant overdenture may become “ixed” just by the \ndesign of the attachments. A complete understanding of \nthe concept of prosthesis movement (PM) is needed by the \nclinician (Fig. 15.8).\nNOT UNDERSTANDING THE CONCEPT OF \nPROSTHESIS MOVEMENT\nAn overdenture is by deinition a removable prosthesis; \nhowever, in function or parafunction the prosthesis may not \nmove (e.g., because of the retentive mechanism, it may become \nixed). Clinicians need to understand that an attachment may \nbe classiied as having movement in all directions; however, \nusing it incorrectly or in combination with other attachments \nresidual ridge while IOD showed bone resorption in the same \narea (Fig. 15.7).39\nReddy et al also conirmed this inding with the measure-\nment of bone height under a ixed detachable cantilever res-\ntoration supported by ive or six endosseous implants. A \ncomputer-enhanced method was used to measure mandibu-\nlar height distal to the last implant, which showed a signiicant \nbone growth in the mandible the irst year of function.40\nNOT UNDERSTANDING THE WIDE RANGE OF \nOVERDENTURE RETENTION\nEtiology\nA common complication that arises with overdenture treat-\nment planning is utilizing the same or “favorite” treatment \nplan (i.e., implant number and position) for all patients. The \nclinician must understand there exists a signiicant difference \nbetween overdenture treatment plans including number of \nimplants, implant positioning, opposing dentition, and \npatient expectations.\nPrevention\nUnderstand Overdenture Mechanics. To develop a man-\ndibular IOD with reduced complications, the inal prosthesis \nshould be predetermined and related to three factors:\n1. Retention: retention is related to the vertical force neces-\nsary to dislodge the prosthesis. The amount of overden-\nture retention is dictated by the number, location, and type \nof attachments.\n2. Support: the support of a prosthesis is related to the \namount of vertical movement of the prosthesis toward the \ntissue. This will vary greatly depending upon the patient’s \nridge form. Support is primarily related to implant \nnumber, independent attachments or presence of a bar \ndesign in the posterior region.\nFIG 15.7 Posterior ridge resorption.

For example, if the prosthesis is rigid (i.e., move-\nment in no direction) when in place but can be removed, the \nPM is labeled PM-0 regardless of the attachments used. If an \nO-ring is used individually, they may provide motion in six \ndifferent directions. However, if four O-rings are placed along \na complete arch bar, the prosthesis rests directly on the bar \nand result in a PM-0 restoration. Because of the design of the \nattachments and prosthesis, the end result would be a ixed \nprosthesis (Fig. 15.10).\nPM-2. A hingelike PM permits movement in two planes \n(PM-2) and most often uses attachments that have the capa-\nbility to hinge. The most common examples of PM-2 attach-\nments are the Dolder bar and clip without a spacer or Hader \nbar and clip. A Dolder bar is egg shaped in cross section, and \na Hader bar is round. A clip attachment may rotate directly \non the Dolder bar. A Hader bar is more lexible because round \nbars lex (x4) related to the distance between the abutments \nand other bar shapes lex (x3). As a result, an apron often is \nadded to the tissue side of the Hader bar to limit metal \nlexure, which might contribute to unretained abutments or \nbar fracture.42 A cross section of the Hader bar and clip \nsystem reveals that the apron, by which the system gains \nstrength compared with a round bar design, also limits the \namplitude of rotation of the clip (and prosthesis) around the \nfulcrum to 20 degrees, transforming the prosthesis and bar \ninto a more rigid assembly. The Hader bar and clip system \nmay be used for a PM-2 when posterior ridge shapes are \nfavorable and soft tissue is stable enough to limit prosthesis \nrotation (Fig. 15.11).\nIt should be noted that for these systems to function as \ndesigned, the hinge attachment needs to be perpendicular to \nthe axis of prosthesis rotation so the PM also will be in two \nplanes (i.e., PM-2). If the Hader or Dolder bar is at an angle \nor parallel to the direction of desired rotation, the prosthesis \nis more rigid and may resemble a PM-0 system. As a conse-\nquence, the implant system may be overloaded and cause \ncomplications such as prosthetic screw loosening or fracture, \nimplant crestal bone loss, and even implant failure.

Attachment and \nthe prosthesis movement are independent from each other \nand should be evaluated as such. An important item for the \nIOD treatment plan is to consider how much prosthesis move-\nment the patient can adapt to or tolerate with the inal restora-\ntion.

The occlusal plane \nto attachment height is a force magniier to the overdenture \nwith any lateral or cantilevered force. When an attachment is \nconnected to an implant directly, the crown height above \nthe attachment is greater than when the attachment is \nplaced on a bar. If you double the crown height, the force is \nincreased 200%. Hence, the individual implant attachment \nhas a greater crown height above the attachment and greater \nlateral force to the prosthesis. Therefore, the overdenture is \nless stable (Fig. 15.13).\nWhen the attachment is placed on a bar, the stability of \nthe prosthesis is improved because less lateral force is applied \nto it (i.e., the crown height above the attachment is reduced). \nWhenever possible, the implant should be connected with a \nbar and an attachment placed on top of the bar.

With these mandibular overdenture \ntreatment options, studies have shown less than 1% implant \nfailure and no prosthesis failure over a 7-year period with 147 \nmandibular overdentures (IOD) when using the organized \ntreatment options and prosthetic guidelines presented in this \nchapter.43 Kline et al reported on 266 implants for mandibu-\nlar splinted implant-supported overdentures for 51 patients \nwith the Misch protocol. An implant survival rate of 99.6% \nand a prosthesis survival rate of 100% were reported.44\nWhen evaluating a patient for a mandibular overdenture, \nideal treatment planning and overdenture mechanics must be \nconsidered. A determination of the inal prosthesis being \ntotally implant supported or soft tissue supported must be \nascertained. Misch has determined the IOD treatment options \nto range from primarily soft tissue support and secondary \nimplant retention (RP-5) to a completely implant-supported \nprosthesis (RP-4) with rigid stability and retention gained pri-\nmarily from overdenture attachments (no soft tissue support). \nThe prostheses are usually supported by two to ive anterior \nimplants for these ive treatment options between the mental \nforaminal area. There are four RP-5 options that have a range \nof retention, support, and stability. The RP-4 restoration is \ndeined as a rigid cantilevered bar that completely supports, \nstabilizes, and retains the restoration (Fig. 15.15).\nComplications arise when patients are treated with the \nsame protocol without regard to the patient’s needs and \nexpectations. For example, a two-implant overdenture may \nwork very well with some patients; however, for others it tends \nto work very poorly. There are many factors that need to be \nevaluated prior to implementing an overdenture treatment \nTOO LARGE OF A CANTILEVER  \n(“HIDDEN CANTILEVER”)\nThe hidden cantilever was postulated by Misch in 1993 and \ndescribes the portion of the removable prosthesis that extends \nbeyond the last implant or connecting bar.43 When hidden \ncantilevers exist, they may result in lack of support for the \nprosthesis, excessive wearing of attachments, increased stress \nto the bar-implant interface, and possible fracture of the \nprosthesis. In many of these cases, the attachment system \ndoes not wear because the removable prosthesis is PM-0 (i.e., \nno prosthesis movement); however, the excessive resultant \nforces place the prosthesis, abutment screws, and marginal \nbone at risk.\nEtiology\nIf the bar/attachment is not designed correctly, the removable \nprosthesis does not rotate at the end of the implant or bar to \nload the soft tissue. This results in a “hidden cantilever.” For \nexample, if a cantilevered bar extends to the second premolar \nbut forces on the second molar of the restoration do not \nresult in movement of the restoration (i.e., posterior-inferior \nmovement, anterior-superior movement), the cantilever \nextends to the second molar position. The cantilever length \nis measured to the point of PM, not to the end of the bar and \nattachment system.\nPrevention\nWith most overdentures, the inal restoration should not \ninclude extension beyond the irst molar. This will minimize \nthe hidden cantilever and will decrease the possibility of \nexcessive force. The design of the overdenture system should \nhave the proper movement, and care should be exercised to \nnot induce a PM movement, especially when minimal number \nof implants exist. (Fig. 15.14).\nFIG 15.14 The hidden cantilever is that portion of the removable prosthesis that extends beyond \nthe connecting bar, which does not rotate. If the prosthesis rotates at the irst molar position \nand the bar extends to the premolar, the true cantilever length is the irst molar position.

Four options are \nRP-5 (posterior soft tissue support) and one option is RP-4 \n(prosthesis completely supported by implants and connective \nbar).

A thorough understanding of the positioning, number, \nand type of implants along with patient expectations should \nbe ascertained according to various treatment plans. In addi-\ntion, reports indicate that RP-5 mandibular IODs may cause \na combination-like syndrome, with increased looseness, sub-\njective loss of it, and midline fracture of the upper denture.45\nINADEQUATE CROWN HEIGHT SPACE\nEtiology\nImplant overdentures may exhibit signiicant complications \nwhen reduced CHS (i.e., interocclusal space) exists. When \nsuficient CHS is lacking, the prosthesis is more prone to \ncomponent fatigue and fracture and has more complications \nin comparison to porcelain-to-metal ixed prostheses.1\nPrevention\nRemovable prostheses have space requirements for elements \nsuch as a connecting bar, type, and position of attachments and \nrestorative material (metal vs. resin). According to English, the \nminimum CHS for individual attachments is 10 mm of CHS \nfor Locator-type attachments and between 12 and 15 mm for \na bar and O-rings.14 The ideal CHS for removable prostheses \nis greater than 14 mm, and the minimum height is 10.5 mm.46 \nThe lowest possible proile attachment should be used in situ-\nations of reduced CHS to it within the contours of the restora-\ntion, provide greater bulk of acrylic resin to decrease fracture, \nand allow proper denture tooth position without the need to \nweaken the retention and strength of the resin base.16\nThe minimum CHS provides adequate bulk of acrylic to \nresist fracture; space to set denture teeth without modiica-\ntion; and room for attachments, bars, soft tissue, and hygiene. \nIn the mandible the soft tissue is often 1 to 3 mm thick above \nthe bone, so the occlusal plane to soft tissue should be at least \n12 mm in height (Fig. 15.16).\nAn osteoplastic procedure to increase CHS before implant \nplacement is often indicated, especially when abundant bone \nheight and width are present. The crown height space should \nbe evaluated and properly treatment planned prior to implant \nplacement. Otherwise, a ixed porcelain-metal restoration \nshould be considered (Fig. 15.17).\nThe most common method of bar retention by almost the \nsame percentage for overdentures is screw retention. In"

A combination of screw \nretention on some abutments and cement retention on others \noffers an advantage for many RP-4 prostheses, especially \nwhen implants are placed in the posterior region.\nPOOR OSSEOUS ANGULATION (C-A)\nEtiology\nWith increased bone resorption, the mandible resorbs from \na division A to division C, eventually being compromised in \nangulation (division C−a). The division C−a is deined as an \nanterior mandible that is angled more than 30 degrees. If the \nclinician is unaware of this angulation, the implants may \nperforate the lingual plate and irritate the tissues of the loor \nof the mouth. If the implants are within the conines of the \nbone, they may enter the crest of the ridge at the loor of the \nmouth and make it almost impossible to restore (Fig. 15.18). \nIn a study by Quirynen et al of 210 computer tomogram \nimages, 28% of the anterior mandibles were lingually tilted \n−67.6 degrees ± 5.5 degrees.47 The mandibles with less than \n−60 degree tilt represent about 5% of the cases (Fig. 15.19).\nAlmost 10% of patients may have a greater than 30-degree \nangle to the occlusal plane. When present, this condition is \nmost often found in the anterior mandible. Root form \nimplants placed in this bone category (i.e., within the cortical \nFIG 15.17 Osteoplasty.

In \nsome cases, conventional removable prosthetics may be indi-\ncated or extensive bone grafting may be warranted to trans-\nform the division C−a into a division A.\nTreatment\nIf implants have been placed prior to restoration, it may be \nthe implants are nonrestorable. If the implants are nonrestor-\nable, treatment options include:\n1. Removal of the implants followed by bone grafting, place-\nment of new implants in a more ideal position.\n2. Surgical cover screws are placed in the implants, thus \n“sleeping” the implants followed by fabrication of a con-\nventional prosthesis.\nNONIDEAL IMPLANT POSITIONING\nEtiology\nUsually, the greatest available bone height in an edentulous \nmandible is located in the anterior region between the mental \nforaminae. This location most likely exhibits optimal density \nof bone for implant support and ease of implant placement. \nThe implant overdenture treatment options presented are \ndesigned for anterior implant placement between the mental \nforamina because the prostheses movement will be more \nlimited and available bone volume and density is more \nfavorable than posterior implants.\nNonideal implant positioning leads to many complica-\ntions, which include hard and soft tissue complications, pros-\nthesis dissatisfaction or fracture, and questionable long-term \nimplant health.\nPrevention\nThe available bone in the anterior mandible (between the \nmental foramen) is divided into ive equal columns of bone \nserving as potential implant sites, labeled A, B, C, D, and E, \nstarting from the patient’s right side (Fig. 15.20).48 The mean \ninterforaminal distance has been shown to be approximately \n53 mm.49 Five implants of 4 to 5 mm diameter can usually be \nplaced with general placement guidelines of 3 mm between \nimplants and 2 to 3 mm from the mental foramen.\nWhen placing implants, regardless of the treatment option \nbeing executed, all ive implant sites should be ideally located \nat the time of treatment planning and surgery. There are three \nreasons for this treatment approach:\n1. The patient always has the option to obtain additional \nimplants and prosthesis support and stability in the future \nif all ive sites were not initially used for implant support. \nFor example, a patient may receive adequate retention, \nstability, and support for an IOD with four implants. \nHowever, if the patient desires a ixed prosthesis in the \nFIG 15.20 (A) The interforaminal space is selected for place-\nment of mandibular implants for overdentures. (B) Five \nimplants sites are easily selected labeled A, B, C, D, E starting \nfrom the right side. \nA\nB\nfuture, the four implants most likely will be inadequate for \nthe new prosthetic requirements. If the clinician does not \nplan an additional implant site during the initial surgery, \nbut instead placed the four implants an equal distance \napart, the additional interimplant space may not be avail-\nable without removing one of the preexisting implants.\n2. A patient may desire a completely implant-supported res-\ntoration (e.g., RP-4 implant supported overdenture or \nFP-3—ixed prosthesis), but for inancial reasons may not \nable to enter into the treatment at that time. Three implants \nin the A, C, and E positions and an IOD may be provided \nirst. This is the initial or irst phase of the treatment, \nwhich has many advantages over a conventional complete \ndenture. Two more implants may be added in the B and \nD locations at a later date, and a completely implant-\nsupported overdenture or ixed restoration may then be \nfabricated (Fig. 15.21).\n3. If an implant complication occurs, the preselected option \nsites permit repeatable corrective procedures. For example, \nif implants were placed in the A, B, D, and E positions and \nan implant fails to achieve rigid ixation, the failed implant \nmay be removed and an additional implant placed in the"

The implants are placed between the foramens in \nthe A through E positions (Fig. 15.22).\nOverdenture Option 1 (OD-1)\nThe overdenture option 1 (OD-1) must be a RP-5 (soft tissue \nsupported with secondary implant support), which means it \nmust be able to rotate and load the posterior soft tissue \nregions of the mandible. The stability and support of the \nprosthesis are gained primarily from the anatomy of the man-\ndible and prosthesis design, which is similar to a complete \ndenture.\nAdvantages. The primary advantage with treatment option \nOD-1 is reduced cost to the patient. The two implants \nare usually the fewest implant number, and no connecting \nbar reduces the prosthetic appointments and the laboratory \ncosts.\nIndications. The irst treatment option for mandibular \noverdentures (OD-1) is indicated primarily when cost is the \nmost signiicant patient factor. However, it is important to \nnote the patient’s desires should also be minimal (i.e., patient \nmust understand the limitations of the treatment plan), and \nthe bone volume in both the anterior and posterior regions \nshould be abundant (division A or B). The posterior ridge \nform should be an inverted U shape, with high parallel walls \nfor good to excellent anatomic conditions for conventional \ndenture support and stability. The problem associated with \nthe existing denture should relate primarily to the amount of \nretention, not stability or support. In addition, the opposing \narch should ideally be completely edentulous and restored \nwith a traditional complete denture (Box 15.5).\nAnatomic Position. Usually, two implants are placed in the \nB and D positions. The implants remain independent of each \nother and are not connected with a superstructure. The over-\ndenture attachment primarily improves retention and gives \nlittle additional support or stability to the prosthesis. The \nstability of the restoration is slightly improved in the anterior \nsection by the implants, and the posterior inverted U shape \nregions from the ridge form are required to improve this \nfactor (Fig. 15.23).\nC position at the same time. This saves an additional \nsurgery and eliminates the time required for bone grafting \nand healing before another implant could be reinserted.\nNOT UNDERSTANDING MANDIBULAR \nOVERDENTURE TREATMENT PLANS\nThe ive treatment options proposed for mandibular implant–\nsupported overdentures provide an organized approach to \nsolving a patient’s complaints that takes into consideration \nvarious anatomic limitations. The treatment options initially \nproposed are designed for completely edentulous patients \nwith division A or B anterior bone who desire an overdenture. \nThese options are modiied when the CHS is excessive (as \nwhen the anterior bone is division C−h) and eliminated for \nFIG 15.21 (A) Patient presented with two-implant overden-\nture with inadequate retention.

The two independent implant retention \nsystems often have more prosthetic-related complications in \ncomparison to other treatment plans. There are several \nreasons the complication risk is increased (Fig. 15.26A).\nPerpendicular to occlusal plane. The two implants \nshould be perpendicular to the occlusal plane to allow the \nposterior regions of the overdenture to move downward and \nload the soft tissue over the mandibular buccal shelves for \nsupport. The hinge rotation should be at 90 degrees to the \nrotation path; otherwise, one side is loaded in a different \nmanner than the other. In addition, because only two implants \nsustain the occlusal load during function or parafunction, \nminimization of the forces to the implant components and \ncrestal bone is achieved by placing the implants in the long \naxis of the implant body and perpendicular to the occlusal \nplane (Fig. 15.26B).\nFIG 15.23 Overdenture option 1 consists of two independent \nimplants. These are best inserted in the B and D positions to \nlimit the forward rocking of the restoration during function. \n(From Misch CE: Dental implant prosthetics, ed 2, St Louis, \n2015, Mosby.)\nB\nD\nFIG 15.24 Care should be exercised to not prevent rotational \nmovement of an RP5 prosthesis. In this example, two \nimplants in the B and D position are accurately placed, \nhowever because the attachments are in different planes, the \nprosthesis becomes a ixed prosthesis. \nFIG 15.25 A and E Implants.

The most common type of attachment used in \nOD-1 is an O-ring or Locator design. The implant support \nmechanism is poor because stress relief of the attachment is \npermitted in any plane. In other words, the stability and \nsupport of the prosthesis are gained primarily from the \nanatomy of the mandible and prosthesis design, which is \nsimilar to a complete denture.\nComplications of OD-1\nLack of posterior support. If the posterior area is not sup-\nported (buccal shelf) adequately, the prosthesis will be loaded \nmainly from the implants. This will lead to excessive forces \nbeing applied to the implants, which may result in bone loss."

In such a case, the more medial implant attachment \nwill wear faster, and the more distal implant will receive a \ngreater occlusal load when the patient occludes in the ante-\nrior region (Fig. 15.27).\nImplant parallelism. The two implants in this treatment \noption should be parallel to each other. The path of insertion \nof the prosthesis should also be similar to the path of inser-\ntion of the attachments. When the implants are not parallel, \nthe irst attachment to engage wears less, and the second \nattachment rubs along the side of the male and increases the \nwear rate. When the path of insertion of the restoration is \ndifferent than the attachments (as when a facial undercut \nbelow the crest exists), the attachments will wear prematurely \n(Fig. 15.27).\nAngulation. If a facial undercut exists, the path of inser-\ntion of the restoration may not coincide because of the \nimplant position. This may lead to chronic sore spots and the \nneed for multiple adjustments. This most often occurs when \nthere has been extensive atrophy (buccal resorption) from a \ndivision A to a division B or C (Fig. 15.28).\nArch form. There are two types of arch forms: the tooth \nposition arch form and the edentulous ridge arch form. It \nshould be noted that the edentulous residual ridge may be \nsquare, ovoid, or tapering. The dentate arch form is also \ndivided into square, ovoid, and tapering categories and may \nbe different than the ridge form. When a tapered tooth posi-\ntion arch form is supported by two independent implants in \na square residual ridge form, the anterior teeth are cantile-\nvered anteriorly from the implant retentive system. More \nimplants are required in this type of tooth-supported ridge \nform combination to help stabilize the prosthesis, and the \nOD-1 option will have a considerable disadvantage.\nDecreased support. Individual implants have more pros-\nthetic complications than when the implants are joined by a \nHeight parallel to occlusal plane. The two independent \nimplants should be positioned at the same occlusal height \nparallel to the occlusal plane. If one implant is higher than \nthe other, the prosthesis will disengage from the lower implant \nduring function and rotate primarily on the higher implant. \nThis situation will accelerate the wear of the O-rings or \nLocator attachments. In addition, because the higher-\npositioned implant receives the majority of the occlusal load, \nan increased risk of complications may occur, including abut-\nment screw loosening, marginal bone loss around the implant, \nand implant failure (Fig. 15.27). If the implant bodies are \npositioned at different heights, the use of different size abut-\nments should be used to make them as level as possible.\nDistance from midline.

The abutment for attachment replaces \nthe permucosal extension. The attachments should be parallel \nto each other and at the same occlusal height. The higher the \nabutment, the more the lateral stability of the prosthesis. \nHowever, at least 2 mm of acrylic should be present between \nthe teeth and borders of the denture around the encapsulator \nof the attachment (Fig. 15.29).\nThe abutments for attachments are provided in different \nheights. The abutment should be ideally 2 mm above the \ntissue and 2 mm below the denture teeth so adequate thick-\nness of acrylic is present. The attachment and encapsulator \nare placed into the implants. The abutments are then tight-\nened with a torque wrench at 20 to 35 N/cm (depending on \nthe manufacturer). Too high of an abutment placement will \nlead to increased torqueing forces and instability.\nOverdenture Option 2 (OD-2)\nIndications. The second treatment option for a mandibular \noverdenture (OD-2) is selected when more support is indi-\ncated in comparison to OD-1 (Box 15.6). The anatomic needs \nand patient desires are similar to the irst option, OD-1. A bar \nis designed to position the attachments for added retention \nat an equal distance off the midline parallel to each other at \nthe same occlusal height and in a similar angulation. The \nideal distance between the implants is in the 14- to 16-mm \nrange or B and D positions.\nAnatomic Position. The implants in OD-2 are also posi-\ntioned in locations B and D, but with this option, they are \nsplinted together with a superstructure bar without any distal \ncantilever. Reduced loading forces are exerted on two anterior \nbar. When implants are supported by a bar, the individual \nimplants have less force and stress applied to the system. \nAttachments are easily made parallel with a bar-fabricated \nprosthesis by the laboratory in similar horizontal, vertical, \nand axial planes. This is much easier and more predictable \nthan relying on the surgical placement making the implants \ncompletely parallel in all planes.\nThe opposing arch for an OD-1 mandibular treatment \noption should be a traditional complete denture. The bite \nforces are reduced when the patient is completely edentulous. \nThe maxillary denture has some movement during function \nand acts as a stress reliever. The instability of the maxillary \ndenture and mandibular OD-1 overdenture is shared. The \nsupport requirements of the posterior regions of the man-\ndible are reduced when opposing a complete denture. Ideally, \nthe opposing arch should be a complete denture when OD-1 \nis the treatment option.\nPatient misconceptions. The OD-1 is used as a treatment \noption when patients understand that a connecting bar or \nadditional implants are beneicial but inancial constraints \nrequire a transition period. However, many patients do not \nrealize the lack of support that is associated with two implants. \nThe ultimate long-range goal in the treatment plan is to \nconvert OD-1 patients to a RP-4 or FP with more implant \nsupport and stability before the loss of the posterior bone in \nthe mandible occurs posterior to the foramina. Future modi-\nication of the treatment plan results in implant placement in \nthe A and E positions. This will allow the four implants (A, \nB, D, E positions) to be connected with a bar that may be \ncantilevered to the posterior.

The A, E position \nis most often the irst premolar and may even be in the second \npremolar position (depending on sex and race). When the \nimplants are joined with a straight bar, the connecting bar is \nlingual to the anterior ridge. The overdenture lange is often \ntoo bulky and may impinge on the sublingual area and affect \nspeech. The denture teeth are anterior to the residual ridge \nand act as a lever on the bar, and the prosthesis is not stable \n(i.e., anterior cantilever). The connecting bar between A and \nE implants lexes ive times more than when the bar connects \nB and D implants; therefore screw loosening is more of a risk. \nWhen a curved bar is used to position it more anterior, the \nprosthesis often rides along the sides of the bar and limits \nPM. If the prosthesis rests against the sides of the curved bar, \nthe PM may even be reduced to PM-0. This places a much \ngreater vertical and lateral load on the implant system. There \nare greater lateral forces on the A, E implant position, which \nmay increase screw loosening.

This will most likely \nimpair oral hygiene procedures and may also be the cause of \nfood debris impaction and soft tissue inlammation. The \nsuccess of the bar may be achieved more easily by the selection \nof the proper height implant abutments and an accurate \nmaster cast. The abutment height should be a minimum of \n1 mm above the tissue and no greater than 2 mm. Too high of \nan abutment will increase force and stress on the prosthesis \ncomponents. The prosthesis attachment system to the super-\nstructure bar is closely scrutinized when Hader and Dolder \nclips are used for retention. The connecting bar and clips \nshould be perpendicular to the path of rotation and parallel \nto the occlusal plane. This usually requires a straight bar per-\npendicular to the midline. A curved bar often places the clips \ncloser to the implants and prevents rotation of the prosthesis, \ntherefore becoming more of a ixed prosthesis (Fig. 15.32).\nThe connecting bar of the restoration should always be \nfabricated after the inal contours and teeth position are \nascertained for the overdenture. Otherwise, compromises of \ninadequate room for denture teeth or overcontoured restora-\ntions (most often on the lingual surface) result. The bar may \nbe connected on the facial aspect of each implant coping. In \nthis way the lingual lange of the prosthesis remains within \nthe contour of a traditional denture.\nPositioning. It should be noted implants placed closer \nthan the B, D position will result in reduced prosthesis stabil-\nity during function, whether they are connected or indepen-\ndent units. When a bar is going to be fabricated, implants \nFIG 15.32 Two-implant bar with implants too close together. \nFIG 15.33 (A) This denture is processed with the acrylic \nreceptor sides over the copings and bar too close and will \nlimit (or prevent) rotation of the implant overdenture during \nfunction.

Additionally, the nonideal positioning may lead \nto future issues if additional implants are treatment planned. \nBy placing implants in a differing position than B and D \nwill result in future inability to place implants in the A, B, or \nC position.\nLever arm. The higher the attachment position, the more \nstable the overdenture will be. However, CHS above the \nattachment will act as a lever arm. The greater the occlusal \nheight, the greater the force and the less stable the overden-\nture to any lateral force. However, the height of the attach-\nments on the connecting bar should allow a minimum of \n2 mm of acrylic space between the denture teeth and attach-\nment to permit adequate dimension for strength. The inter-\nnal aspect of a bar-retained overdenture should not be \nprocessed against the sides of the abutment or bar because \nthis will limit rotation and increase the possibility of fractures \n(Fig. 15.33).\nCantilever.

A superstructure bar connects the \nimplants but with no distal cantilever. A PM-2 or greater can \nbe designed with three A, C, and E anterior implants. In the \nfuture, when more retention, support, and stability is war-\nranted, additional implants may be placed in the B and D \npositions. If the posterior ridge form is poor (division C–h), \nthe lack of lateral stability places additional forces on the \nanterior implants. Implants then are best placed in the B-C-D \nposition to allow greater freedom of movement of the pros-\nthesis. The greater the stress to the system, the greater pros-\nthesis movement/stress relief indicated. This increases the \nposterior movement of the restoration, but decreases the \namount of stress placed on the implants and screw-retained \nbar (Fig. 15.35).\nAdvantages. There are many advantages of splinting A, C, \nand E implants compared with implants in the B and D \nto counter the effect of the cantilever. An increased risk of \nprosthetic and abutment screw loosening exists with the can-\ntilever (Fig. 15.34).\nIncreased fee. Because a bar is indicated in OD-2, the \nclinician must take into consideration the increased associ-\nated expense. A laboratory fabricated bar/attachment can be \ncostly. The patient should be well aware of this prior to the \ninitiation of treatment.\nOverdenture Option 3 (OD-3)\nIndications. The third treatment option may be used when \nthe opposing arch is a denture and the patient has moderate \nto low retention, support, and stability needs. With an oppos-\ning complete denture, the amount of force on the prosthesis \nis minimized. When the posterior ridge form is poor (divi-\nsion C−h or D bone), the OD-3 is the lowest treatment option \nsuggested.\nThe OD-3 treatment option is usually the irst option \npresented to a patient with minimal complaints and is con-\ncerned primarily with retention and anterior stability of the \nIOD when cost is a moderate factor. The posterior ridge form \nshould be evaluated because it determines the posterior \nlingual lange extension of the denture (buccal shelf), which \nlimits lateral movement of the restoration in this treatment \noption (Box 15.7).\nFIG 15.34 The connecting bar between implants B and D \nshould not be cantilevered to the distal (arrow).

As a result, a straight bar may be fab-\nricated perpendicular to the path of rotation (Fig. 15.36).\nFabricating a RP-4 prosthesis. With a three-implant over-\ndenture, an RP-5 prosthesis should always be fabricated \nbecause of the need for soft tissue support. Often an RP-4 \nprosthesis is fabricated with a three-implant treatment plan, \nleading to overloading the implants. This may result in exces-\nsive attachment wear or an accelerating wear of attachments.\nOverdenture Option 4 (OD-4)\nIndications. The patient’s indications for the OD-4 treat-\nment option as a minimum requirement include moderate to \npoor posterior anatomy that causes a lack of retention and \nstability of the IOD, history of recurrent soft tissue soreness, \nor dificulty with speech. The clinician must understand the \nedentulous posterior mandible resorbs four times faster than \nthe anterior mandible. In the C−h posterior mandibles, the \nexternal oblique and mylohyoid ridges are high (in relation \nto the residual ridge) and often correspond to the crest of the \nresidual ridge. The muscle attachments are at or near the crest \nof the posterior ridge. Another condition that indicates an \nOD-4 as a minimum treatment option is when the patient’s \ncomplaints and desires are more demanding than for the \nprevious treatment options (Box 15.8).\nPositions. With the fourth mandibular overdenture option \n(OD-4), four implants are placed in the A, B, D, and E posi-\ntions. This is often the minimum number of implants when \nthe patient has opposing maxillary natural teeth, or C−h \nanterior bone volume with CHS greater than 15 mm. The \nimplants usually will provide suficient support to include a \ndistal cantilever up to 10 mm on each side if the stress factors \nare intermediate to low (i.e., parafunction, CHS, masticatory \ndynamics, and opposing dentition) (Fig. 15.37).\nCantilever. The cantilevered superstructure (bar) is a \nfeature of the four or more implant treatment options in a \ncompletely edentulous arch for three reasons:\n1. Increase in implant support compared with OD-1 to \nOD-3.\npositions. The implants splinted in the A, C, and E positions \nusually do not form a straight line. The C implant is most \noften anterior to the more distal A and E implants (in the \npremolar regions) and ideally directly under the cingulum \nposition of the anterior incisor denture teeth (increased A-P \nspread). The restoration beneits from direct occlusal load to \nthe implant support in the anterior arch, which reduces \ntipping and improves stability. As a consequence, when more \nthan two implants are placed in the anterior mandible, a \ntripod support system may be established. To determine the \namount of beneit of an A-P distance, the distal of the most \nposterior implants on each side are connected with a straight \nline. The distance from this line to the perpendicular position \nof the center implant is termed the A-P spread. The greater \nthe A-P spread of the A, C, and E implants, the greater the \nbiomechanical advantage of the bar to reduce stress on the \nimplants because they are splinted together. The splinted \nA-C-E implant and bar position is more stable than the B-D \nposition for the prosthesis. The lateral stability of the over-\ndenture system is improved because the implants are in the \nA and E positions and the attachments are in the B and D \npositions and more distal than OD-2. In addition, the con-\nnecting bar can be higher off the tissue when the interocclusal \nspace permits, and the attachment-to–bone height dimen-\nsion can be greater. As a result, rotation of the prosthesis is \nmore limited compared with OD-1 and OD-2. Therefore, the \nthird implant for OD-3 for a division C–h mandibular eden-\ntulous patient is a considerable advantage because of the \ncompromised height.\nBar/Attachment System. O-rings/Locators attached to the \nconnecting superstructure offer greater leeway in bar design \nand position. An O-ring is often used when CHS permits to \nincrease the crown height attachment–to-bone dimension \nand decrease the occlusal plane–to-attachment dimension. \nThe smaller the occlusal plane–to-attachment distance, the \nmore stable the overdenture is to lateral forces. The intaglio \nsurface of the prosthesis should not contact the sides of the \nconnecting bar because this would result in too rigid a system, \nplacing too much force on the bar system.\nThe connecting bar should be parallel to the plane of \nocclusion, and the attachments should be placed at the same \nheight along the bar. Such placement is needed for the pros-\nthesis to rotate effectively during function. No cantilever of \nthe bar should be designed within this three-implant system. \nHowever, the attachments may be placed on the distal of the \nA and E abutments, similar to a Kennedy class 1 partial \ndenture design (if positive force factors).\nComplications of OD-3\nImproper attachment design. The IOD option 3 usually \ndoes not use two Hader clips for the attachment. Because the \ntwo clips do not rotate in the same plane, the prosthesis is \nusually too rigid, and the clips do not rotate unless they expand, \nmaking wearing of the clip and bar a common complication. \nIf a clip attachment is designed for the prosthesis, the bar may \nconnect the facial of the A and E implant copings and the \nFIG 15.36 An implant overdenture option 3 should rarely use \na Hader clip for the attachment system.

Because the implants are splinted, a 25-lb distal force \nis magniied to 50 lb to the anterior implant and 75 lb (50 + \n25 = 75) to the distal (fulcrum) implant.\nArch form. As a general rule the posterior cantilever from \nanterior implants may be equal to the A-P distance when \nother stress factors are low to moderate. The mandibular \nresidual ridge arch form may be square, tapering, or ovoid. \nThe arch form relates to the A-P distance of A-E and B-D \nimplants. Square arch forms limit the A-P spread between \nimplants and may not be able to counteract the effect of a \ndistal cantilever.\nA square arch form often results in an A-P distance of 4 mm \nor less. Under these conditions a minimum cantilever should \nbe designed, and a PM-3 to PM-6 restoration is indicated. The \ndistal cantilevers are signiicantly reduced for square arch \nforms. In a mandibular ovoid to tapering arch form, the A-P \nspread between implants in the A, E and D, B positions is \ngreater and permits a longer distal cantilever. This A-P spread \nis usually 8 to 10 mm in these arch forms and often permits a \ncantilever up to 10 mm from the A and E positions.\nIt should be emphasized that the A-P spread is only one \nfactor to determine the length of the cantilever. When stress \nfactors such as occluding forces are greater, the cantilever is \ndecreased. Parafunction, opposing arch, masticatory dynam-\nics, and CHS affect the amount of force on the cantilever. For \nexample, when the crown height is doubled, the moment \nforces are doubled. Under ideal, low-force conditions (crown \nheight less than 15 mm, no parafunction, older female \npatient, opposing a maxillary denture), the cantilever may be \nup to 1.5 times the A-P spread for OD-4 overdentures. When \nthe force factors are moderate, the cantilever should be \nreduced to 1 times the A-P spread. The amount of distal \ncantilever is related primarily to the force factors and to the \narch form, which corresponds to the A-P spread (Fig. 15.38).\nAttachments. The most common attachment type is an \nO-ring or Locator because its position allows the most \nfreedom. The usual O-ring positions are on the distal aspect \nof each bar and in between the A-B and D-E positions. An \nalternative is to position one O-ring in the C implant position \n(because no implant is at this site). The two distal O-rings \npermit rotation of the restoration toward the buccal shelf, \nand the anterior O-rings permit the restoration to rotate up \ntoward the incisal. The connecting bar gives implant support \nfrom the premolar region forward and lateral stability. The \nO-rings provide adequate retention. A smaller-size O-ring or \nless retentive material usually is positioned in the anterior, \nespecially when two anterior O-rings are used.\nAdvantages. The patient beneits from the four-implant \noption because of greater occlusal load support, lateral pros-\nthesis stability, and improved retention. The prosthesis loads \nthe soft tissue over the buccal shelf and the irst and second \nmolars and retromolar pad regions. The amount of occlusal \nforce on the implant system is reduced (compared with a \nixed restoration or RP-4 prosthesis) because the bar does not \nextend to the molar position, where the forces are greater.\n2. Biomechanical position of the splinted implants is \nimproved in an ovoid or tapering arch form compared \nwith OD-1 or OD-2.\n3. Additional retention is provided by the fourth implant for \nthe superstructure bar, which limits the risk of prosthetic \nscrew loosening and other related complications of canti-\nlevered restorations.\nIn considering a distal cantilever for a mandibular over-\ndenture bar, the implant position is the primary local deter-\nminant. Cantilevers may be compared to a class 1 lever in \nmechanics. The distalmost implant on each side acts as a \nfulcrum when occlusal forces are applied to the distal canti-\nlever. The amount of the occlusal force is magniied by the \nlength of the cantilever, which acts as a lever. For example, a \n25-lb load to a 10-mm cantilever results in a 250-lb mm force.\nThis moment force is resisted by the length of the bar \nanterior to the fulcrum. If the two anterior implants (B and \nD) are 5 mm from the fulcrum (distal implants A and E), the \neffect of the posterior cantilever is reduced. If the implants \nare 5 mm apart, the mechanical advantage of the lever is the \n10-mm cantilever divided by the 5-mm A-P spread, which \nFIG 15.37 In overdenture option 4, four implants are placed in \nthe A, B, D, and E positions.

The overdenture \nattachments often are placed in the distal cantilevers with an \nO-ring attachment in the midline. The prosthesis is still RP-5 \nbut with the least soft tissue support of all RP-5 designs. The \nanterior attachment must allow vertical movement for the \ndistal aspect of the prosthesis to rotate toward the tissue.\nHader bar/clip positioning. The use of Hader bar/clips, \nwhich permit rotation, are dificult to use on cantilevered \nsuperstructures. To allow movement, the clip must be placed \nperpendicular to the path of rotation, not along the cantile-\nvered bar where its only function then is retention (and limits \nrotation). When Hader bar/clips are made nonperpendicular \nto the path of insertion, the prosthesis becomes ixed, which \nresults in increased force to the bar/attachment system.\nOverdenture Option 5 (OD-5)\nIndications. The ifth mandibular overdenture option \n(OD-5) is designed for two types of patients. Most important, \nthis is a minimum treatment option for patients with moder-\nate to severe problems related to a traditional mandibular \ndenture. The needs and desires of the patient are often \nmost demanding and may include limiting the bulk \nor amount of the prosthesis, major concerns regarding func-\ntion (mastication and speech) or stability, posterior sore \nspots, or the inability to wear a mandibular denture. This \noption is often indicated when maxillary teeth or a ixed \nimplant restoration is in the opposing arch (especially with \nparafunction) (Box 15.9).\nThe second patient condition that determines this option \nis for the treatment to stop the continued bone loss in the \nposterior mandible. If no prosthetic load is on the posterior \nbone, the resorption process is delayed considerably and \noften reversed.

The Hader clip may be added as \na backup system for additional retention in case an O-ring \nstud breaks or when the vertical dimension of occlusion does \nnot permit the use of high-proile retentive O-rings and \ncauses repeated fracture of the overlying acrylic denture. It \ncan also provide additional retention to prevent sticky food \nfrom lifting the posterior aspect of the denture.\nThe six-attachment bar design also permits a method to \ndecrease stress to the bar and implants if screw loosening \nor bone loss around the implants is noticed. The Hader \nclip and bar may be sectioned off the connecting bar. The \nRP-4 prosthesis then is converted to a RP-5 restoration \nbecause it may rotate on the two O-rings placed just distal to \nthe posterior implants.\nMAXILLARY OVERDENTURE \nCOMPLICATIONS\nThe maxillary overdenture concept is much different in com-\nparison to mandibular overdentures in many aspects. Fewer \nreports have been published for maxillary IOD compared \nwith mandibular overdentures. According to Goodacre et al, \nmandibular overdentures have one of the highest implant \nsuccess rates, and the restoration with the highest implant \nfailure rate is a maxillary overdenture (19% failure rate).54 A \nprospective study by Johns et al reported on maxillary IODs \nat 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years.55 Sixteen patients were followed \nthroughout the study with a cumulative success rate of 78% \nfor prostheses and 72% for implants.\nNOT UNDERSTANDING THE  \nADVANTAGES ASSOCIATED WITH  \nA MAXILLARY OVERDENTURE\nFacial Esthetics May Be Enhanced\nThe loss of facial esthetics often occurs irst in the maxillary \narch, with the loss of vermilion border of the lip, increased \nlength of the maxilla lip, and lack of facial bone support. \nHowever, patients may not realize these changes are related \nand are accelerated because of the loss of teeth and bone. The \nuse of implant-retained prosthesis has the advantage of \ndecreasing the continued bone loss and prevent the later \ncomplications found in the maxillary arch. Although dificult \nbecause of the premaxillary bone loss, a maxillary overden-\nture may eliminate the complications.\nLess Soft Tissue (Palatal) Coverage\nThe extended soft tissue coverage of a maxillary denture \nnegatively affects the taste of food and acts as an insulator to \ntemperature. The soft tissue may become tender in the \nextended vestibular borders as the crest of the ridge resorbs. \nThe palate of a maxillary prosthesis may cause gagging in \nsome patients. Most of these disadvantages of a complete \nmaxillary denture may be eliminated in an implant-supported \noverdenture, especially with an RP-4 horseshoe overdenture. \nside. No statistical differences were found between different \nimplant lengths. The stresses increase with the length of the \ncantilever. Stress factors need to be evaluated carefully and \npondered before an extended cantilever is designed.\nStresses are magniied in direct proportion to the length \nof cantilever and should be planned carefully based on the \npatient’s force factors and the existing anatomy. The A-P dis-\ntance is greater than in OD-4 because the C implant is often \nmore anterior than the B and D implant sites. A square ridge \nform usually has an A-P spread of less than 5 mm and should \nhave a minimum cantilever even with ive implants joined \ntogether. An ovoid arch has an A-P spread from 5 to 8 mm \nand a tapered arch form more than 8 mm. In these situations \na cantilever of two times this distance is indicated when force \nfactors are not excessive (see Fig. 15.39).\nIf any major stress factors (e.g., parafunction, opposing \narch) are not favorable, the cantilever should be reduced. The \npatient force factors are as important as the A-P spread. In a \nstudy in which the failure criterion was the failure of the \nscrew joint with arrangements of three, four, ive, and six \nimplants with a similar A-P spread submitted to forces from \n143 to 400 N, the greater transmitted forces to the prosthetic \nconnection always exceeded the yield strength of the system. \nThis study emphasizes the fact that the amount and duration \nof occlusal load is even more important than the A-P spread \nto be considered for cantilever length determination.53\nThe superstructure bar may be cantilevered up to two \ntimes the A-P distance with low stress factors for three \nreasons. The additional C implant increases the implant–\nbone surface area of the system, adds another retentive \nelement to the bar to reduce screw loosening, and increases \nthe A-P dimension. This helps counter act the class 1 lever \naction created by the distal cantilever.\nFive implants also allow the superstructure and prosthesis \nto be cantilevered forward from the anterior ridge. This is of \nparticular beneit for Angle’s skeletal class II patients. The \nlower lip is supported by the maxillary teeth when the jaw is \nat rest. Traditional mandibular dentures reconstruct the origi-\nnal horizontal overjet, so the lower anterior teeth position \ndoes not infringe on the neutral zone during rest or function. \nHowever, in an RP-4 restoration, the teeth may be set in a \nskeletal class I pattern, where they provide the best esthetic \nresult. This also increases the amount of function in the ante-\nrior region. Because these patients are skeletal class II, the \nforward anterior tooth position also places the molars forward, \nreducing the need for a more distal cantilever. The distal can-\ntilever reduction also decreases the posterior lever force.\nAttachments. Usually four to six retentive attachments are \nincluded in the cantilevered bar design. The attachments are \ntypically O-rings, Locators, or Hader clips. Because of their \nnumber and distribution, the attachments provide retention \nand oppose PM. Typically, four O-rings are distributed evenly \n(two anterior and two posterior to the distal implants). If the \nOVD is limited or parafunction is present, the IOD may use \na metal framework within the prosthesis (similar to a partial \ndenture). This design reduces the risk of IOD fracture."

The \nlarger CHS may facilitate the fabrication process of remov-\nable overdentures because it is easier for denture tooth setup \nand greater bulk of acrylic can be used to strengthen the \nprosthesis. The inadequate CHS may make an overdenture \ncontraindicated. In these situations the denture tooth posi-\ntion may be affected, the prosthesis may repeatedly fracture, \nand the attachments may be compromised. This often occurs \nin the maxilla because of the available bone and trajectory. \nWhen less than 12 mm of CHS is present, an osteoplasty is \nconsidered before implant insertion. However, rarely can an \nosteoplasty be completed because insuficient bone will be \navailable for implant placement (Fig. 15.40).\nHidden Cantilever\nA rigid overdenture (RP-4) has identical requirements for \nimplant support in position and number as a ixed prosthesis \nbecause it is rigid during function. Soft tissue support in \naddition to implant-supported removable implant restora-\ntions with an excessive CHS are recommended when it is not \npossible to adequately engineer the implant support system. \nMisch has described the “hidden cantilever” beyond the can-\ntilevered bar with a rigid IOD.59 When the overdenture has \nno movement during function, the cantilever does not stop \nat the end of the cantilevered substructure but ends at the last \nocclusal contact position on the prosthesis, often the distal of \na second molar. This can lead to occlusal overload and over-\nstress to the implant system.\nPoor Treatment Planning Options\nWhen the premaxilla is compromised with regards to avail-\nable bone, some clinicians will treatment plan posterior \nimplants (premolar and molar) without implant support in \nthe canine regions. The prosthetic design is to connect the \nimplants with a full-arch bar for a maxillary overdenture. \nThis is not indicated when a bar extends from premolar to \npremolar around an arch because the overdenture prosthesis \nReducing the bulk of the prosthesis, especially when the \npalate is eliminated from the overdenture, is more of a patient \nbeneit in comparison to the mandibular overdenture. Elimi-\nnating the palate reduces the gagging effect from some \npatients and improves the taste of food in some individuals. \nIn some patients, an anatomic variant is present that includes \ntaste factors from the 11th nerve that innervate taste buds in \nthe palate. Although unusual, these patients beneit from the \nreduction of the palate of their overdenture.\nDecreases Premaxillary Resorption\nWhen the resorption of the premaxilla increases, the maxil-\nlary denture will become unstable. The maxillary anterior \nteeth will become positioned more facially with respect to the \nresidual bone. As a result, the denture will rotate up in the \nanterior, resulting in rotation in a downward direction in the \nposterior. The denture will lose the posterior valve seal as a \nconsequence. In the maxillary arch an implant-retained over-\ndenture should be considered before signiicant bone is lost in \nthe premaxilla. The complete anterior ridge and even the nasal \nspine may be resorbed in the maxilla, causing pain and an \nincrease in maxillary denture movement during function.56\nSeveral factors affect the condition of the premaxilla and \nmay result in a decrease in implant survival or an increase in \nprosthetic complications. The completely edentulous ante-\nrior bony ridge is often inadequate for endosteal implants. \nThe facial cortical plate may be resorbed from periodontal \ndisease or often is lost during the extraction of teeth. In addi-\ntion, the facial cortical plate resorbs during initial bone \nremodeling, and the anterior ridge loses 25% of its width \nwithin the irst year after tooth loss and 40% to 60% over 3 \nyears, mostly at the expense of the labial plate. As a result, the \nmaxillary denture migrates to a more palatal position.57\nIn the maxilla, horizontal and vertical loss of bone results \nin a more palatal ridge position. As a consequence, implants \nare often inserted more palatally than the natural tooth posi-\ntion. With overdentures, this is an advantage. Removable \nrestorations have several advantages under these clinical cir-\ncumstances. The removable prosthesis does not require \nembrasures for hygiene. The facial cantilevered ixed prosthe-\nsis may make it impossible to perform sulcular hygiene. The \nremovable restoration may be removed during sleep to \ndecrease the effects of an increase in CHS on nocturnal para-\nfunction. The removable restoration may improve the lip and \nfacial support, which is deicient because of the advanced \nbone loss. The overdenture may have suficient bulk of acrylic \nresin to decrease the risk of prosthesis fracture. The increase \nin CHS permits denture tooth placement without infringe-\nment of the implant-prosthetic substructure.\nAbility to Increase Soft Tissue Support\nThe primary advantages of a maxillary IOD compared with \na ixed prosthesis is the ability to provide a lange for maxil-\nlary lip support, the improved sulcular hygiene, and the \nreduced laboratory fee compared with a ixed restoration. As \na consequence, before the selection of a speciic prosthesis \ntype and to facilitate the diagnosis, the labial lange above the"

The rigid, posterior implants act as fulcrums, \nand the restoration is not stable.\n2. The implants in the premolar regions act as the fulcrum, \nand the incisal edge of the prosthesis is cantilevered \nfrom this position. As a result, the attachment system \nrepeatedly fails. This type of prosthesis resembles a \nKennedy class IV partial denture and is the least stable \nrestoration in prosthetics. In fact, it is usually less stable \nthan a conventional denture.\n3. The posterior implants in this type of restoration are in a \nstraight line and do not resist the lateral forces as well. \nOften the attachments repeatedly need replacement, and \nall the implants on one side of the arch may fail.\nNot Taking Into Consideration Treatment Planning \nFactors. To increase implant and prosthesis survival rates, \ntreatment for maxillary overdentures with division A bone is \nplanned similarly to treatment for mandibles with C minus \nheight (C−h) bone and greater factors of forces. In other \nwords, four or more implants are inserted from irst premolar \nto irst premolar. In addition, subantral augmentation often \nis performed to place more distal implants and dramatically \nimprove the A-P distance when the anterior and posterior \nimplants are splinted with a bar. This treatment approach has \nproved successful in yielding success rates similar to those for \nmandibular overdentures.\nFrom a biomechanical perspective the implant-restored \nanterior maxilla is often the weakest section compared with \nother regions of the mouth. Compromised anatomic condi-\ntions and their consequences include the following factors.\nPoorer bone quality. In the majority of patients with \navailable bone in the maxilla, the bone is less dense in the \nanterior maxilla than in the anterior mandible. In the man-\ndible a dense cortical layer is coupled with coarse trabecular \nbone strength and permits implants to be supported by a \ndenser bone quality. The maxilla presents thin, porous bone \non the labial aspect, very thin, porous cortical bone in the \nloor of the nasal region, and denser cortical bone on the \npalatal aspect. The trabecular bone is usually ine and is also \nless dense than the anterior region of the mandible.\nForce issues. In the premaxilla, esthetics and phonetics \ndictate that the replacement teeth be placed at or near their \noriginal position, often cantilevered off the residual ridge, \nwhich usually is resorbed palatally and superiorly. Crown \nheight as a force magniier is of paramount importance in the \nanterior maxilla, where the natural crown height is already \ngreater than in any other region even under ideal conditions. \nThe arc of closure is anterior to the residual ridge; as a con-\nsequence, the moment force is greatest against the maxillary \nanterior crowns supported by implants and directed against \nthe thinner facial bone. All mandibular excursions place \nlateral forces on the maxillary anterior teeth, with resulting \nincreased stress on the crestal bone, especially on the labial \naspect of the implant.\nAvailable bone. The narrow ridge of a premaxilla has \nparallel walls of bone, so an osteoplasty to increase width is \nis completely implant supported (RP-4) and will not move \n(PM-0) during function or parafunction. As such, the over-\ndenture acts as a ixed restoration with less support and \nwithout implants in the key implant positions.\nAnother poor treatment option for fully edentulous max-\nillae is the placement of implants in each posterior quadrant \n(no canine position) with independent bar segments and an \noverdenture (Fig. 15.41). This treatment option is prone to \nfailure for the following reasons:\n1. If the IOD in the maxilla has only posterior implants and \nis not rigid, the prosthesis rocks forward and up every time \nFIG 15.40 Less than 15 mm crown height space (CHS) for \nan implant overdenture may compromise the position of the \noverdenture teeth and increase the risk of prosthesis frac-\nture.

The RP-5 treatment plan is often \nused as a transition to an RP-4 prosthesis when inancial \nconsiderations of the patient require a staged treatment.\nImplant Number/Position. The maxillary OD-1 treatment \nplan for a completely edentulous maxilla uses four to six \nimplants supporting an RP-5 prosthesis, of which three are \nusually positioned in the premaxilla. Based on the poor \nsuccess rates reported in the literature, speciic biomechanical \nrequirements, and poor bone quality, the fewest number of \nimplants for a RP-5 maxillary overdenture should be four, \nwith a wide A-P spread (Fig. 15.42). Implant number and \nlocation are more important than implant size, but the \nimplants should ideally be a minimum of 9 mm in length and \n3.5 mm in body diameter. An improved and more predictable \nnumber of implants for an RP-5 prosthesis is ive. The key \nimplants are positioned in the bilateral canine regions and at \nleast one central incisor position.

In the poste-\nrior maxilla, compromised bone quantity is also an issue \nresulting in the need for subantral augmentation.\nMAXILLARY OVERDENTURE  \nTREATMENT OPTIONS\nWhereas there are ive overdenture treatment plans for \nthe mandible, there are only two options for the maxilla \n(Box 15.10). The difference is primarily due to biomechanical \ndisadvantages of the maxilla compared with the mandible. \nIndependent implants are unpredictable with a higher inci-\ndence of morbidity and are completed with caution. In addi-\ntion, the attachment is closer to the tissue, and the CHS from \nthe attachment is greater, so the prosthesis has more move-\nment. As such, the two treatment options are limited to a \nremovable prosthesis RP-5 restoration with 4 to 6 implants \nwith some posterior soft tissue support, or an RP-4 restora-\ntion with 6 to 10 implants (which is completely supported, \nretained, and stabilized by implants).\nOption 1: Maxillary RP-5 Implant Overdenture\nIndications. The irst treatment option with a maxillary \nimplant-retained overdenture is an RP-5 prosthesis. This \noption is not as beneicial to the patient compared with man-\ndibular RP-5 restorations. A RP-5 maxillary IOD may have \nassociated movement and may even rock more than a denture \nbecause the anterior implants act as a fulcrum under the \nprosthesis.

The other primary \nbeneit is the maintenance of the premaxillary bone because \nof implant force stimulation to the bone. There is also a \nreduced fee compared with a RP-4 prosthesis because bilat-\neral sinus grafts are not required for molar implants, and the \nnumber of implants may be as few as four.\nOption 2: Maxillary RP-4 Implant Overdenture\nIndications. The second option for a maxillary IOD is a \nRP-4 prosthesis with 6 to 10 implants that is rigid during \nfunction (Fig. 15.44). This option is the preferred IOD design \nbecause it maintains greater bone volume and provides \nimproved security and conidence to the patient compared \nwith a denture or RP-5 prosthesis. The loss of bone width in \nthe premaxilla does not require a bone graft or hydroxyapa-\ntite graft for lip support as for a ixed prosthesis. However, \nthe cost of treatment parallels that of a ixed hybrid prosthe-\nsis. The RP-4 restoration most often still requires sinus grafts \nand posterior implants. In some instances, extensive bone \ngrafting may be indicated for the entire premaxilla for a ixed \nprosthesis. The RP-4 restoration may be required for facial \nesthetics if augmentation procedures are not performed.\nUnfortunately, many practitioners believe that the RP-4 \noverdenture requires fewer implants and less attention to the \nbiomechanics of occlusal load compared with a ixed restora-\ntion just because the restoration is removable. This is a \nprimary cause of implant failure in maxillary IODs. When \nthe IOD is completely supported, retained, and stabilized by \nthe implant support, it acts as a ixed prosthesis. The number \nof implants is similar to that of a ixed prosthesis.\nImplant Number/Positions. Treatment planning for RP-4 \nmaxillary overdentures is very similar to ixed prosthesis \nbecause the IOD is ixed during function. Two of the key \nimplant positions for the RP-4 maxillary IOD are in the bilat-\neral canines and distal half of the irst molar positions. These \npositions usually require sinus grafts in the molar position. \nAdditional posterior implants are located bilaterally in the \npremolar position, preferably the second premolar site \n(greater force than irst premolar). In addition, at least one \nanterior implant between the canines often is required. The \nAnother alternative is the use of a lateral incisor implant. In \nsuch cases, owing to the reduced A-P spread of the lateral \nincisor in the anterior most implant site, the second premolar \nposition also should be used on the contralateral side (along \nwith the canine) to improve the A-P spread. Six implants are \noften indicated for an RP-5 prosthesis when force factors are \ngreater (Fig. 15.43).\nProsthetic Design. The implants are always ideally splinted \ntogether with a rigid bar. There is no distal cantilever, and the \nbar design should follow the dental arch form but slightly \nlingual to the maxillary anterior teeth. This will allow for \nmore room of acrylic for strength and retention. The pros-\nthesis should have at least two directions of movement; \nhowever, three or more are preferred. A Dolder clip or O-ring \nmay be used if it is placed in the center of the arch and per-\npendicular to the midline. A Dolder clip has a spacer over the \nclip to allow some vertical movement before rotation. When \nO-rings are used to retain the restoration, they may be posi-\ntioned more distal than a center Dolder clip, often immedi-\nately distal to the canine position. O-rings may also be used \njust distal to the last abutment on each side or between the \nimplants. When intermediate O-rings are used, relief is pro-\nvided distal to the bar to allow prosthesis movement toward \nthe tissue under posterior occlusal forces.\nSupport. The maxillary RP-5 IOD is designed exactly as a \ncomplete denture with fully extended palate and langes. The \nrestoration should be allowed to move slightly in the incisal \nregion during function so that the restoration may rotate \ntoward the posterior soft tissue around a fulcrum located in \nthe canine or premolar position. The prosthesis is soft tissue–\nsupported with secondary retention from the implants. Ideal \nsupport on the primary stress-bearing area of the maxilla \nmust be utilized (horizontal palate).\nAdvantages.

The residual edentulous bone determines the A-P \ndistance for implant support. The dentate arch form will \ndetermine the arch form for the inal prosthesis. Both arch \nforms may be described as ovoid, tapering, or square.\nTypes of Arch Forms\nOvoid. The ovoid arch form is the most common followed \nby the square and then the tapered form. The ovoid arch form \nhas qualities of both tapered and square arches.\nSquare. The square arch form may result from the residual \nformation of the basal skeletal bone. However, the presence \nof a square arch form is more common in maxillary implant \npatients as a result of labial bone resorption of the premaxilla \nregion when anterior teeth are lost earlier than the canine. \nThe square dental arch form is preferred when canine \nand posterior implants are used to support anterior teeth in \neither arch.\nTapering. The tapering arch form is often found in skeletal \nclass II patients as a result of parafunctional habits during \ngrowth and development. It is not uncommon to ind differ-\nent arch forms in the upper and the lower arches. The taper-\ning residual ridge arch form is favorable for anterior implants \nsupporting posterior cantilevers.\nImportance of Arch Form\nThe dentate and edentulous arch forms are not necessarily \nrelated, and the worst situation in the maxilla corresponds to \na square residual arch form that supports a tapered dental \nrestoration. The prosthesis cantilever off the anterior avail-\nable bone is greatest in this combination (Fig. 15.46).\nThe arch form is a critical element when anterior implants \nare splinted together and support a posterior cantilever res-\ntoration. For these conditions, a square arch form provides a \npoorer prognosis than a tapered arch form. The A-P distance \nor A-P spread is the distance from the center of the most \nanterior implant to a line joining the distal aspect of the two \nmost distal implants.60 It provides an indication as to the \namount of cantilever that can be reasonably planned. When \nive anterior implants in the mandible are used for prosthesis \nsupport, the cantilevered posterior section of the restoration \nshould not exceed two times the A-P spread when all patient \nforce and stress factors are low and bone density is favorable. \nThe actual length of the cantilever depends not only on \nimplant position but also on other stress factors, including \nparafunction, crown height, implant width, and number.\nThe predominant factors to determine the cantilever \nlength are related to stress, not only the A-P distance. For \nexample, the distance between two implants supporting a \nanterior implant often may be placed in the incisive canal \nwhen inadequate bone width is present (Fig. 15.45). Six \nimplants is the minimum suggested number for a RP-4 treat-\nment option, and seven implants are used more often. When \nforce factors are greater, the next most important sites are \nthe second molar positions (bilaterally) to increase the \nA-P spread and improve the biomechanics of the system. A \n10th implant may be placed in the premaxilla for a tapered \narch form.\nProsthesis Design. The 6 to 10 implants are splinted \ntogether around the arch with a rigid bar (ive-sided arch in \ntreatment planning). Four or more attachments are usually \npositioned around the arch. This provides a retentive, stable \noverdenture prosthesis. Usually palatal coverage is main-\ntained with a horseshoe design. This helps prevent speech \nproblems and allows for greater patient comfort.\nOcclusal Scheme. The occlusal scheme for this RP-4 resto-\nration is similar to that for a ixed prosthesis: centric occlu-\nsion around the arch and only anterior contact during \nmandibular excursions (unless opposing a mandibular com-\nplete denture). The maxillary overdenture should be removed \nduring sleep to prevent nocturnal parafunction. If the patient \nwears maxillary and mandibular overdentures, only the man-\ndibular restoration needs to be removed. However, the maxil-\nlary overdenture should be removed for a short interval \nduring the day.\nAttachments. The position and type of overdenture attach-\nments may render an overdenture rigid during function even \nin the absence of distal cantilevers on the bar. For example, \nwhen three anterior implants are splinted together and a \nHader clip is used to retain the prosthesis, if the Hader clips \nare placed at angles to the midline, the attachments have \nlimited movement and result in a rigid overdenture during \nfunction.\nAdvantages. The main advantage of an RP-4 maxillary \nprosthesis is the minimal palatal coverage. Because the \nFIG 15.45 Incisive canal implant."

The resulting restoration is a ixed, anteriorly \ncantilevered prosthesis to restore the original arch form. \nUnder these conditions, greater stresses are placed on the \ndentate-tapered arch forms compared with dentate square \narch forms, all other factors being identical.60\nThe maxillary anterior cantilever to replace teeth in a \ndentate-tapered arch form requires the support of additional \nimplants of greater width and number to counteract the \nincrease in lateral load and moment force. For example, not \nonly are the canine implants necessary, but two more addi-\ntional anterior implants are also suggested even if bone graft-\ning is required before their placement. In addition, additional \nposterior implants in the irst to second molar region splinted \nto the most anterior implants are highly suggested. If a maxil-\nlary tapered arch form requires this treatment approach, at \nleast eight implants (four on each side) and an increased A-P \ndistance from molar implants splinted to incisor implants is \nsuggested. In addition, second molar implants should be \nsplinted to the anterior implants to increase the A-P distance. \nIn the maxilla the recommended anterior cantilever dimen-\nsion is less than for the posterior cantilever in the mandible \nbecause of poor bone density and forces directed outside the \narch during excursions.\nOVERDENTURE ATTACHMENT \nCOMPLICATIONS\nThe selection of the overdenture attachment system is often \na confusing part of the prosthetic rehabilitation of the patient. \nClinical studies concerning the attachments are scarce and \ndificult to evaluate. Usually, attachment selection is based on \nthe clinician’s personal preference, laboratory preference, \nexpert opinion, or empirical information. An ideal overden-\nture attachment should have basic features to minimize and \ndecrease clinical complications. An overdenture attachment \nmain goal is to retain the prosthesis and allow movement \nduring function or removal of the prosthesis. As a conse-\nquence of forces applied to the prosthesis, all overdenture \nattachments wear and become less retentive over time. The \nclinician should understand the positive and negative inher-\nent factors associated with attachments.\nIdeal Attachment\nEase of Replacement. Ideally, the attachment selected \nshould allow ease of replacement. A chair side, cold-cure \nacrylic procedure should not have to be used every time the \nattachment needs replaced. This leads to nonproductive time \nfor the clinician and also places the prosthesis at risk of being \naltered. Additionally, this will result in considerable time, risk, \nand frustration every time the attachment is changed. To \nprevent this issue, an attachment should be selected that \nallows for easy replacement and long-term use.\nAbility to Control Retention. The ideal overdenture attach-\nment should also offer many options to control the degree of \nretention. A mobile or minimally retentive attachment at the \ninitial delivery ensures improper it leading to prosthesis \ncantilever (C) forms a class I lever. For implants 10 mm apart \nand a 10-mm posterior cantilever, the following forces are \napplied: a 25-lb force on cantilever C results in a 25-lb force \non the most anterior implant from the cantilever (A) and \n50 lb for the nearest implant to the cantilever (B), which acts \nas a fulcrum. An interimplant distance of 5 mm with the same \n10-mm cantilever and a 25-lb force applied on C results in a \n50-lb force on A and a 75-lb force on B. The distance between \nimplants signiicantly increases the forces to both implants. \nBut in the irst example, if a patient with parafunction bites \nwith a 250-lb force on C, the force on implant A is 250 lb, \nand the force on implant B is 500 lb. In other words, parafunc-\ntion is much more meaningful in terms of force than the \ninterimplant distance (A-P distance) when designing a can-\ntilever. A-P distance is only one stress factor to evaluate for \ncantilever length. Parafunction, crown height, masticatory \ndynamics, arch position, opposing arch, direction of force, \nbone density, implant number, implant width, implant design, \nand A-P distance are all factors to be considered. When the \nforce factors are low and the area factors (implant number, \nwidth, and design) are high, the cantilever length may be as \nmuch as two times the A-P distance in good-quality bone.\nAs mentioned previously, anterior endosteal implants \noften may not be inserted in their ideal location in the maxilla \nas a result of labial plate resorption and inadequate bone \nwidth at the implant site. This not only requires implant \nplacement more palatally compared with the original natural \nteeth, but it may also negate the lateral and central positions \nand require the use of the canine regions in more advanced \nFIG 15.46 The dental arch form may be different than the \narch form of the residual arch. A tapered dentate arch form \non a square residual bone form is the worst combination \nbecause the anterior teeth are cantilevered from the implant \nabutments.

For a single unsplinted attachment, 4 N \nhas been suggested as the minimum retentive force.61 Other \nstudies have shown a cumulative force of 20 N of retentive \nforce needed for a two-implant mandibular overdenture.62 \nWhen evaluating the retentive capabilities of attachment \nsystems, the term peak load is used to deine the maximum \nforce that is developed before complete separation of the \nattachment components from the implant abutments. When \nevaluating peak load, various attachment systems have been \nclassiied as: (1) high (e.g., ERA gray), (2) medium (e.g., \nLocator LR white, Spherolex ball, Hader bar and metal clip, \nERA white), (3) low (e.g., Locator LR pink), and (4) very low \n(e.g., Shiner magnet, Maxi magnet, Magnedisc magnet) \nretention groups.63\nAlsabeeha et al showed that Locator attachments white, \npink, and blue connectors have demonstrated higher reten-\ntive forces than either a 7.9-mm prototype ball attachment \ndesign or the standard 2.25-mm ball attachment.64 Other \nstudies have shown the attachment with the highest peak load \nwas the Zest Anchor Advanced Generation (ZAAG) attach-\nment (Zest Dental Solutions), in comparison to the Nobel \nBiocare ball, the Zest Anchor, and the Sterngold ERA (Stern-\ngold Dental, LLC).65 The ZAAG attachment showed signii-\ncantly the highest retentive vertical and oblique forces under \ndislodging tensile forces applied to the housings in the verti-\ncal and oblique directions.\nIdeal Attachment Summary. In implant dentistry today the \ntwo most common attachment systems to use are the Locator \nsystem and the O-ring attachment system. They have the \nuniversal advantage of different retention strengths, utilize \nmetal encapsulators, are easy to change and replace, and have \nthe male component in the oral cavity. The Locator and \nO-ring have been shown to be long lasting through numerous \nclinical studies. And lastly, both of these attachments can be \nused independently or attached and incorporated into a bar \nvia cast-to or cemented protocols (Fig. 15.49).\nComplications of Dental Implant Attachments\nRetention Loss Over Time. The main complication over \ntime with dental implant attachments is the loss of retention. \nDepending on the situation, this is highly variable and depen-\ndent on many factors. Retention loss over time studies show \nthe wear-induced structural changes inherent with every \nattachment system will inevitably lead to a reduction or total \nloss of retention. Mechanical action alone or a combination \nof chemical and mechanical actions will induce loss of mate-\nrial from the surface, which is deined as wear. Wear has been \nshown to decrease the attachment’s retention, lead to deterio-\nration and deformation, work hardening, and can also lead \nto attachment fracture.66 Factors that predispose to loss of \nretention and wear include the following:\nMastication wear. The attachment wear from occlusal \nforces is much different from insertion-removal cycles. In \nmost overdentures (RP-5), the amount of occlusal load \napplied to the attachment is dictated by the resiliency of the \ntissue. The amount of mucosa displacement will reduce the \nmovement and possible screw loosening. Adequate retention \nshould be ascertained prior to the inal insertion of the pros-\nthesis. A gradual increase in retentive capability may be \nachieved later by replacing the component within the encap-\nsulator by a more retentive attachment. Likewise, if more \nretention is required in the future, a stiffer element, which \nis held by the same encapsulator, easily solves the problem \n(Fig. 15.47).\nMale Attached to Implant/Female in Prosthesis. Most \nattachments used in implant dentistry today have the male \ncomponent in the oral cavity and the female in the prosthesis. \nThe male can be more easily cleaned while in the mouth, and \nthe more dificult component (i.e., female) may be cleaned \nwith direct vision via access outside of the mouth (i.e., within \nthe prosthesis). When the female component is part of the \nimplant or connecting bar, if any plaque or food accumulates \nwithin the component, the overdenture will not seat com-\npletely. This will lead to patient frustration because of \nocclusal disharmonies, lack of retention, and possible tissue \nimpingement (Fig. 15.48).\nAdequate Retention for the Prosthesis. The retention and \nstability are signiicant factors that affect the type of \nFIG 15.47 Control of retention. (A) Locator: various colored \ninserts with varying degrees of retention.

Mechanical fatigue has been \nshown to reduce retention on almost all attachment systems \nafter 15,000 fatigue cycles.62 Studies have shown approxi-\nmately 800 cycles are needed to attain relatively stable \nretention of overdenture attachments.68 The Locator pink \nattachment remained the most retentive after fatigue, com-\npared to the ERA orange and white. However, researchers \nconcluded that implant parallelism has more impact on com-\nplications that occur than the choice or type of attachments.69 \nWhen directly picking up the attachment, care should be \nexercised not to place too much force on the denture (i.e., \ndisplacement force). Any installation load greater than 0 N \nwill have a resultant force acting on the prosthesis/implant.\nOther studies have evaluated the force-related issues with \nthe insertion and removal consequences of attachment \nsystems. Alsabeeha et al submitted various attachment \nsystems to either axial or paraxial forces in the range of \n540 to 10,000 cycles from repeated insertion and removal of \nthe prosthesis. This would represent 6 months to 9 years of \nclinical function, on the basis of three daily overdenture \nremovals and insertions for hygienic purposes. A common \ntrend toward reduction or total loss in retentive force was \nfound across the majority of the attachment systems.70 \nRutkunas et al concluded that ball-socket attachments have a \ngradual and continuous loss of retention after repeated \ninsertion-removal cycles. This loss can be abrupt after \napproximately 500 cycles and may reach 80% of the initial \nvalue after 2000 cycles.68\nTYPES OF ATTACHMENT SYSTEMS\nO-Ring Attachment System\nThe O-ring attachment system is composed of an elastic \nO-ring, a metal encapsulator, and a metal post. It may be used \nas an independent unit or part of a connecting bar that joins \nthe implants together (Fig. 15.50). O-rings are doughnut-\nshaped, synthetic polymer gaskets that possess the ability to \nbend with resistance and then return to their approximate \noriginal shape. In part, this feature results from a three-\ndimensional network of lexible elastomeric chains. The \nO-ring attaches to a post with a groove or undercut area \nwithin the O-ring. The O-ring is compressed radially between \ntwo mating surfaces consisting of a post and a metal encap-\nsulator into which the O-ring is installed. The O-ring has \nbeen used primarily in removable prosthetics as a retentive \ndevice and has seen a resurgence in popularity with overden-\ntures supported by endosteal implants and is widely available \nin a variety of implant systems.71 The advantages of O-rings \nare ease in changing the attachment, the wide range of move-\nment, low cost, different degrees of retention, and possible \nelimination of the time and cost of a superstructure for the \nprosthesis.\nRange of Motion. All O-ring applications are categorized in \nterms of relative motion. In situations that require few or no \nmoving parts or movement, the O-ring is classiied as static \n(e.g., gasket or washer). In situations involving reciprocation, \ndenture movement and less force on the attachment. Studies \nshowing simulated masticated Locator attachment retention \nto be reduced by 40% with a nonlinear descending curve. \nThis correlates with maintenance issues being directly related \nto masticatory forces. In this study, only minor changes were \nfound for ball type attachments.67\nFIG 15.49 Attachment location. (A) Independent attach-\nments. (B) Incorporated into a bar.

The \nthree components of the post are a head, neck, and body. \nThe head is wider than the neck, and the O-ring is com-\npressed over the head during insertion. Under the head of \nthe post there is an undercut region called the neck or groove \nthat the ring engages after it stretches over the head. The \nbody of the post is connected to the implant abutment or \nsuperstructure bar.\nComplication. Overpolishing of a cast post head or neck \nregion may unwittingly cause a decrease in retention of the \nsystem. When the attachment is fabricated and cast within \nthe bar system, care should be exercised to not overpolish \nwhen inishing.\nO-Ring Size. The inside surface of the O-ring slides over the \npost neck or groove. The internal diameter (hole diameter) \nof the O-ring must be smaller than the post neck and it \nsnugly in the groove diameter. The O-ring inside diameter \nwill be stretched to 1% to 2% (not to exceed 5%) when in \nplace against the post neck.72 If not, the O-ring will roll or \nwobble over the post and increase wear and tear of the attach-\nment. O-rings and posts may come in a variety of diameters \ndepending on the space available within the volume of the \nprosthesis. The larger the diameter of the O-ring system, the \neasier it is to place the O-ring within the encapsulator. Trou-\nbleshooting retention complications is also easier, and greater \nretention is possible with a larger-diameter system. Typically, \nthree sizes of O-rings are used in implant prostheses (small, \nmedium, and large) (Fig. 15.52).\nComplication. The manufacturer’s size protocol should \nbe adhered to for all O-ring systems. Too large of an O-ring \nrotation, or oscillating motion relative to the O-ring, it is \nclassiied as dynamic. The dynamic movement of the O-ring \nallows it to be one of the most resilient or mobile types of \nattachments.\nO-rings may allow motion in six different directions. \nHowever, if a superstructure connects the implants, the range \nof motion decreases. If the O-ring is placed on a complete \narch bar in four different sites and the prosthesis rests on the \nsuperstructure bar, the restoration may have PM of 0 (PM-0). \nTwo O-rings placed on a bar perpendicular to the midline \nmay have two to six directions of PM, depending on the \nresilient depression of the O-rings, whether a spacer is over \nthe post head, or space is over the connecting bar.\nEncapsulator. A metal or plastic encapsulator permits the \neasy replacement of the O-ring after wearing or damage. This \neliminates the need for chairside cold curing of a new attach-\nment in place. Virtually every O-ring encapsulator has an \nundercut region that houses the O-ring, called the internal \ncavity. The O-ring volume must be larger than the internal \ncavity. As a result, the O-ring is compressed into position in \nthe encapsulator and prevents the ring from moving or \nrolling while in place, which prematurely damages and wears \nthe ring. The overall size of the encapsulator is larger than the \nO-ring and should be placed with the O-ring on the O-ring \npost during fabrication of the prosthesis to ensure adequate \nspace (>2 mm of acrylic) (Fig. 15.51).\nO-Ring Post. The O-ring post usually is made of machined \ntitanium alloy when used as an independent attachment or a \nDelrin post that is waxed and cast in metal alloy along with \nFIG 15.50 An O-ring attachment has a resilient O-ring gasket \n(top right), a metal encapsulator (top left), and a male post \n(middle).

    "content": "616\nCHAPTER 15 Removable Implant Complications\nO-Ring Materials. The US Food and Drug Administration \nhas issued guidelines for O-rings used in medicine. The elas-\ntomeric materials meeting these requirements include silicone, \nnitrile, luorocarbon, and ethylene-propylene. The materials \nare available from a variety of industrial manufacturers.72\nComplications. The clinician should be aware of the type \nof O-ring material used. Silicone is composed of a group of \nelastomers made from silicone, oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon. \nSilicones are known for their retention of lexibility and low-\ncompression set characteristics. Silicones are also fungus \nresistant, odorless, tasteless, and nontoxic. However, poor \ntensile and tear strength, low abrasion resistance, and high \nfriction characteristics preclude silicones from effective \nO-ring use in most implant dynamic situations. In addition, \nsilicone is not compatible with petroleum-based products \nsuch as petroleum jelly.73 Ethylene-propylene is a copolymer \nof ethylene and propylene, sometimes combined with a third \ncomonomer. Similar to silicone, this elastomer performs \npoorly when exposed to petroleum-based products.\nNitrile is one of the more widely used elastomers for \nimplant O-ring use. Nitrile combines excellent resistance \nto petroleum-based products, silicone greases, water, and \nalcohols, with a good balance of desirable properties such \nas high tensile strength and high abrasion resistance. Fluoro-\ncarbon also combines excellent resistance to petroleum \nproducts with outstanding chemical resistance. Fluorocarbon-\nbased compounds approach the ideal for a universal O-ring \nmaterial.74\nSurface treatment of O-rings with lubricants helps protect \nthem from abrasion, pinching, and cutting during perfor-\nmance. External lubrication also helps seat the O-rings easily \ninto the metal encapsulator with minimal twisting or damage \nand maximal assembly speed. In all cases requiring O-ring \nlubrication, a lubricant should be selected that is compatible \nwith the O-ring compound and the oral environment. Nitrile \nO-rings may be lubricated with petroleum jelly or petroleum-\nbased ointments. Petroleum-based products will damage \nsilicone O-rings, so a water-based lubricant (e.g., KY-Jelly \n[Johnson & Johnson]) that has a glycerin component should \nbe used.\nO-Ring Failure. O-rings typically fail in their application \nbecause of the combined adverse effects of stress and envi-\nronmental elements (i.e., friction, heat, and swelling).75 Such \nenvironmental factors may be compounded by incorrect \nO-ring size, improper laboratory technique, installation \ndamage during inal component assembly, and failure to \nproperly maintain or lubricate the O-ring.\nExtrusion and nibbling. Extrusion and nibbling occur \nwith forced extension of part of the O-ring into the clearance \ngap of the metal encapsulator. The problem is identiied by \nO-ring diameter enlargement or many small bites (nibbles) \ntaken from the internal diameter of the O-ring. This results \nwhen O-ring materials are too soft, oral luids degrade the \nO-ring, or the O-ring is too large for the metal encapsulator. \nThe clinical solution for this problem is to use a harder O-ring \nmaterial or install a properly sized O-ring.\nsize will result in compromised retention and too small of an \nO-ring will prevent full seating of the prosthesis. Most O-rings \nare speciically made (e.g., size, retention) for the speciic \nimplant and abutment system.\nO-Ring Height. The O-ring attachment system needs a \nminimum of 5 mm or more height, which is the greatest of \nany attachments for overdentures. In addition, a space of 1 to \n2 mm above the O-ring post is suggested to ensure the ring \nseats completely over the head of the post. This space also \nprevents the post from penetrating or fracturing the prosthe-\nsis over the head and allows apical movement for a partial \nsoft tissue–supported removable prosthesis (RP-5).\nComplications. The height requirements of the O-ring \nattachment present several disadvantages. A decreased CHS, \nwhich is often present in overdenture cases, may require a \nlower-proile attachment. A denture tooth, O-ring, post, bar, \nand hygiene clearance often require at least 12 to 15 mm of \nCHS to allow suficient room for the acrylic base of the res-\ntoration to resist fracture. In addition, the higher the freedom \nof movement of a stress-relief attachment (required for all \npartial soft tissue–supported prostheses), the greater the \nmoment of force on the attachment. Because the rotation \npoint of O-rings is at the neck of the O-ring post, the point \nof rotation is not as high as irst perceived. However, if the \nprosthesis is made incorrectly and places lateral forces on the \npost, the lever arm of the post height can increase the force \nto the bar, screws, implants, and bone.\nO-Ring Hardness. O-ring hardness can be measured with \na durometer, which measures surface resistance to the pene-\ntration of an indentation point. The resultant numerical \nrating of hardness ranges from 0 to 100. The softest O-rings \nwill range from 30 to 40, and the hardest are 80 to 90. Color \nis not indicative of hardness as this is dependent on the \nmanufacturer.72\nFIG 15.52 O-ring size identiication.

The most common cause of this type of failure \nis parafunctional clenching on the prosthesis. Other problem \nsources include selection of an elastomer with poor compres-\nsion set properties or excessive “squeezing” or biting of the \nprosthesis into place to seat the restoration. The suggested \nsolution is to make sure the prosthesis is removed at night or \nto reduce the O-ring hardness, which reduces the compres-\nsion required to insert the prosthesis.\nInstallation damage. Installation damage is one of the \nmost common types of O-ring complications. This failure \nmode is marked by short cuts, notches, or a skinned or \nperipherally peeled surface. The problem sources include \nsharp edges on the encapsulator from poor laboratory tech-\nnique, sharp edges on the O-ring post head, too large an \nO-ring for the encapsulator, twisting or pinching of the \nO-ring into the encapsulator, attempting to insert the O-ring \nSpiral failure. A spiral failure results when certain seg-\nments of the O-ring slide while other segments simultane-\nously roll (Fig. 15.53).

Abrasion may occur in dynamic O-rings \ninvolved in reciprocating, oscillating, or rotary motion. This \nfailure pattern can be identiied by a lattened, worn surface \non the inner diameter of a cross section of the O-ring. The \nmost common cause is bruxism by the patient or lifting and \nseating of the overdenture as a nervous habit. Another source \nof the problem includes a rough metal surface on the post \n(acting as an abrasive). The suggested recommendations are \nto use metal inishes; change to a more abrasion-resistant \nO-ring material (nitrile); or eliminate abrasive contamina-\ntion, which may be found in the diet (e.g., the abrasive par-\nticles found in chewing tobacco).76\nFIG 15.53 (A) Spiral failure of an O-ring exhibits a series of \ndeep spiral cuts on the surface.

One of the most common complications of \nLocator implant attachments involves distortion of the over-\ndenture attachments from malalignment of the male and \nfemale components. Many patients prefer to “bite” the over-\ndenture into place, causing damage to the attachments. To \navoid this complication, the locator was designed to be self-\naligning. This is accomplished by the rounded contours of \nthe female attachment (in the mouth) and the nylon male (in \nthe overdenture). The skirt of the male attachment is guided \ninto position, similar to guide planes on a partial denture.\nDual Retention. Another important quality of the Locator \nattachment is the “dual retention” of the attachment. The \nnylon male attachment engages both the inside and outside \nof the female attachment. The retentive surface area is doubled \nwith respect to other types of attachments. This feature allows \nfor greater longevity of retention (Fig. 15.56).\nAttachment Divergence. A common complication of over-\ndenture attachments is a divergence between implants that \nprevent the prosthesis from seating completely. With the \nLocator attachment, the nylon male insert is allowed to pivot \nwithin the metal housing. The pivotal advantage allows the \nstandard male to accommodate 10 degrees each, for a total of \n20 degrees between implants. In cases with extended diver-\ngence, there are extended range male attachments that allow \nfor divergence of 20 degrees each or a total of 40 degrees. \nStudies have shown with this tolerance for divergence, reten-\ntion may reach up to 60,000 insertion/removals.78\nResilient Function. The locator is one of the most resilient \nattachments used in implant dentistry. The resiliency allows \nmovement between the prosthesis and the implant, allowing \nand transferring stress from the implants to the tissue bearing \nareas. The male remains in static contact with the female \nsocket while the metal housing has a full range of rotational \nmovement over the male.\nUse in Cases With Lack of Interocclusal Space. A common \nproblem that leads to prosthesis fracture is the lack of interoc-\nclusal space. If insuficient space is available, increased com-\nplications will result. This occurs because of inadequate \nacrylic thickness, overcontoured prosthesis, and increased \nsusceptibility to breakage. The Locator metal housing with \nnylon male inset requires approximately 2.27 mm above the \ntissue, and the female abutment needs to extend only 1.5 mm \nabove the tissue for the male element to seat without imping-\ning on the tissue. With external hex implants a minimum of \n3.2 mm is required; 2.5 mm is required for internal hex \nimplants. Locator female abutments are also available in \nwith a sharp instrument, too small an O-ring for the post, or \nlack of O-ring lubrication during installation. The suggested \nsolutions include installing properly sized O-rings, using a \nblunted insertion instrument, and using lubrication during \nassembly (Fig. 15.55).\nLocator Attachment\nThe Locator attachment system (Zest Anchors) has been \navailable in implant dentistry since 2000. The Locator attach-\nment has become one of the most popular attachments in \nimplant dentistry today. The advantages of the Locator \ninclude the ease of insertion and removal, dual retention \ncapabilities, low vertical proile, ability to pivot, toleration of \nimplant divergence, and increased resiliency. Although this \nattachment system is associated with a similar incidence of \nprosthodontic complications as other attachment systems, \nFIG 15.55 Ideal replacement of an O-Ring.

Removal of processing males (used during the retroitting \nstep to lock the position of the metal housing inside a \ndenture base): To remove processing or worn nylon males, \nthe male removal tool is slightly unscrewed from the \nmiddle section of the male removal tool.\n3. Removal of worn males and insertion of new male attach-\nments: The inverted conical tip is inserted into the worn \nmale and pulled straight back for removal. The male \nremoval tool is then screwed completely into the middle \nsection to protrude the plunger and kick off the male insert. \nA new nylon male is placed on the middle male seating \nsection and inserted into the metal housing (Fig. 15.58).79\nHader Bar and Clip\nHelmut Hader, a master dental technician, developed the \nHader bar and rider system in the late 1960s, and this system \nwas unchanged for almost 30 years. English, Donnel, and \nStaubli modiied the system in 1992 to form the Hader EDS \nsystem.80 The Hader bar system involves a semiprecision bar \nattachment that provides hinge movement. The function of \nthe bar is based on the principle of mechanical snap-retention \ntechnology (Fig. 15.59).\nComplications\nBar position. A common complication arises when two \nimplants are positioned in the A and E positions and con-\nnected with a bar. Because the implants are placed farther \n0 mm connections for lat-top connection implants.79 With a \ntotal attachment height of only 3.17 mm (male plus 1-mm \ncollar abutment) for an externally hexed implant, the Locator \nattachment has been shown to save a minimum of 1.68 mm \nto 3.05 mm of interocclusal space compared to other implant \noverdenture attachments (Fig. 15.57).\nAvailable in Multiple Abutment Heights. The abutment \nshould be selected that results in a minimum of 1.5 mm \nabove the tissue. If less height is available, the male attach-\nment will not be able to seat completely. The clinician should \nmeasure the deepest portion of the implant to tissue crest in \ndetermining the height selection. The Locator attachment \nis available for use with most implant systems. The abut-\nments are available in numerous tissue heights ranging from \n0 to 6 mm in 1-mm increments. Ideally, 1.5 mm of the abut-\nment should be above the tissue. The tissue cuff height mea-\nsurement must be taken at each implant site using the \ndeepest side of the tissue for measuring from the apical \nshoulder of the implant to the crest of the tissue. The \nworking portion of the Locator abutment is at or slightly \nabove the gingival level.\nLocator Core Tool. When replacing Locator attachments, \ncare should be exercised to use the Locator tool.

This may create problems with speech and possible \nfracture of the prosthesis. If implants are placed in a diagonal \nposition (A → D or B→ E), friction-free movement will not \nbe possible, which will result in excessive pressure and force \non the implants. Ideally, the bar should be perpendicular to \nthe line that bisects the angle formed by the most distal \nimplants.\nClip assembly. The ideal length for a clip bar is 20–24 mm \nto accommodate two clips and housings. If less space is avail-\nable, inadequate retention will result. The clips have three \ndifferent retention strengths and a 20-degree clip rotation, \nwhich greatly improves the lexibility of the system for a range \nof patient needs or desires. In addition, a gold-plated stainless \nsteel housing maintains the clip, which reduces the need to \ncold cure new attachments in place. This is a signiicant \nadvantage because the gold plating minimizes the color \nbleeding through the prosthesis. The Hader bar and clip is a \ntype 2 attachment and may be used for PM-0 or PM-2 treat-\nment plans.\nThe standard or EDS Hader bar has a round superior \naspect and an apron toward the tissue below. The apron acts \nas a stiffener to improve the strength of the bar and limit its \nlexibility. Round bar designs lex in relation to x4 (x to the \n4th power). In other words, a bar twice as long lexes 2 × 2 × \n2 × 2 = 16 times more. Other bar shapes lex to x3 or 2 × 2 × \n2 = 8 times more. This is a considerable improvement. The \nheight of the apron or stiffener is related to the amount of \nclearance between the bar and gingiva.\nThere are three color-coded clips/riders with three reten-\ntive strengths. In order, from lightest to strongest, they are \nwhite, yellow, and red. The use of metal housings with Hader \nplastic clips/riders is recommended. In addition to plastic \nclips/riders, the adjustable gold alloy clips/riders are an avail-\nable option.\nDesign/movement. Because of poor design, Hader clips \nmay wear prematurely. The clip rotation compensates for the \nresilience of the posterior soft tissue, which is usually 0.5 to \n1 mm in the mandible. Highly mobile tissue, more often seen \nin the maxilla, requires a greater range of clip movement. For \na bar and clip to rotate, several important design features must \nbe considered. For example, the bar should be aligned per-\npendicular to a line bisecting the angle between the posterior \narches and should be parallel to the plane of occlusion.81\nInterocclusal space. Whereas the EDS bar is only 3 mm \nhigh, the original was 8.3 mm in height. The total height of \nthe Hader bar and clip assembly may be as low as 4 mm \nrather than the 5 to 7 mm required for an O-ring system. A \ngreater moment of force is placed on the bar during rotation, \nand clearance is required under the denture base. However, \nthe increase in CHS above the attachment may make the \nprosthesis less stable to lateral loads for PM-2–type prosthe-\nses (Fig. 15.60).\nDolder Bar\nThe Dolder bar is a prefabricated precision bar attachment \ndeveloped by Dr Eugen Dolder in Switzerland. This bar \nsystem comes in two different forms: (1) rigid: a U-shaped \nbar with parallel walls; and (2) resilient: egg-shaped form in \ncross section, which provides vertical and hinge resiliency.\nThe Dolder bar and its metal sleeve are made of gold alloy \n(Elitor) and is adjustable so the clinician can control the \namount of retention provided by the bar. The Dolder bar is \nusually soldered to the abutments, and the sleeve should be \nsecured in the denture base with self-cure acrylic.\nThe Dolder bar is usually used in patients who have \nincreased crown height space and when a minimum resil-\niency and maximum retention is indicated. There are various \nsizes ranging in height from 2.3 to 3.0 mm and in width from \n1.6 to 2.2 mm (Fig. 15.61).\nComplications. The complications associated with a \ndolderbar/clip are similar to the Hader bar/clip.\nMISCELLANEOUS REMOVABLE \nCOMPLICATIONS\nBAR TRY-IN RESULTING IN PAIN\nIn certain clinical situations, when trying in the bar, the \npatient may experience pain. The pain may originate from \nmany different areas (Fig. 15.62).\nEtiology\nNonpassive Prosthesis. Nonpassive prosthesis (i.e., ill-\nitting) can be due to poor impression technique, laboratory \nerror, or milling or casting discrepancy.\nIncorrect Placement. Incorrect insertion placement can \noccur, especially when placing the bar where there is deep \nsulcular tissue present. This will result in the bar not being \nable to be seated fully."

(A) Locator abutment placed onto each implant using the Locator hand driver \nwith a Locator abutment holder. Hand tighten. (B) A white block-out spacer is placed over the head of each Locator abutment. \nThis blocks out the area immediately surrounding the abutment allowing the full resilient function of the pivoting metal denture \ncap over the Locator male. A Locator cap with a black processing insert is placed on each Locator abutment. (C) Denture base \nis hollowed out to accommodate the protruding Locator males. There must be no contact between the denture and the titanium \ncaps. If the denture rests on the metal cap, excess pressure on the implant will result and the prosthesis will be ill-itting. Lingual \nvent holes should be made for excess acrylic to escape. (D) A chairside light cure acrylic resin or a permanent self-curing acrylic \nis used to bond the denture caps to the denture. A small amount of a material of choice is placed into the recessed area of the \ndenture and around the denture caps. Seat the prosthesis, verify occlusion. (E) After the acrylic has cured, the denture is removed \nand the white spacer is discarded. Voids are illed with acrylic and the excess is removed. (F) The black processing male is \nremoved from the denture cap with the use of the Locator male removal tool.

All screws should then be sequentially tightened and \ntorqued to manufacturer’s recommendations (Fig. 15.64)\nNote: If there is any rocking present or open margins, the \nbar is nonpassive and should be sectioned /soldered or redone.\nTreatment\nNonpassive Bar. Fabricate new bar or solder (e.g., bar is \nsectioned, all screws ixated, luted together with GC Pattern \nResin or impression plaster, pick-up impression).\nIncorrect Placement. Reinsert with ideal path of insertion.\nLoose Abutment. Tighten abutments prior to bar try-in; \nverify with radiographs to ensure complete seating.\nPoor Bone-Implant Interface.

Additionally, iatrogenic \ndamage of the implant titanium surface should be avoided \nbecause it could harbor plaque and enhance gingival tissue \ninlammation.\nPROSTHESIS WITH LACK OF SOFT TISSUE \nSUPPORT FOR RP-5\nThe clinician must understand the inherent differences \nbetween a RP-4 and an RP-5. Because the RP-5 is soft tissue–\nsupported (buccal shelf), it is mandatory the prosthesis have \nadequate lange support, mainly in the primary stress bearing \narea (maxilla: horizontal palate; mandible: buccal shelf). If \nthe primary stress-bearing area is not utilized, the prosthesis \nwill be loaded as an RP-4, completely soft tissue–supported \n(Fig. 15.66).\nEtiology\nIf extension is not utilized in the prosthesis to encompass the \nprimary stress-bearing areas, the implants will be overloaded. \nA common error is an RP-5 mandibular treatment plan (two \nor three implants) that has insuficient soft tissue support. \nThis will result in overstressing the implants, leading to \nincreased morbidity and/or bone loss.\nPrevention\nMaxillary. For RP-5 prostheses the horizontal palate should \nhave ideal primary stress-bearing coverage. An RP-5 must be \na full-coverage prosthesis (no horseshoe design) (Fig. 15.67). \nA RP-4 (i.e., more implants) would be indicated if a horse-\nshoe palate is required.\nMandibular. For mandibular RP-5 prostheses, the buccal \nshelf should have adequate coverage because this is the \nprimary stress-bearing area. The buccal shelf is a lat area in \nthe mandible bounded by the crest of the ridge (medially), \nexternal oblique ridge (laterally), and retromolar pad (dis-\ntally; Fig. 15.68). This area has a thick submucosa and lies \nperpendicular to the occlusal plane.\nFIG 15.66 RP-5 lack of tissue support. No buccal shelf \nsupport increases movement and rocking of the prosthesis. \nFIG 15.67 Maxillary RP-5 should always have full palatal \nsupport. \nFIG 15.68 Mandibular RP-5 should have peripheral exten-\nsions similar to a complete denture. \nDENTURE TEETH FRACTURES/DEBONDING\nWith overdentures, if insuficient space exists, the prosthesis is \nmore prone to fracture. Denture or composite teeth may “pop-\noff” for a number or reasons (i.e., most common is the lack of \nsuficient acrylic). Repairing a fracture or adding a denture \ntooth is often a time-consuming and dificult procedure.\nEtiology\nWhen insuficient space is available for acrylic (<2 mm), this \nwill result in denture base fracture or teeth debonding. It is \ncommon for laboratory technicians to hollow out denture \nteeth to gain additional space. However, this results in the \npossibility of the denture teeth fracturing or debonding from \nthe prosthesis. Denture teeth may become debonded from \nlack of mechanical retention (Fig. 15.69).\nPrevention\nBulk of Acrylic. Acrylic is always stronger in bulk. A \nminimum of 2 mm of acrylic should be maintained. In some \nsituations a different attachment system may need to be"

When there is a lack of \nacrylic, denture teeth may fracture or become unbounded \nfrom prosthesis. \nFIG 15.70 Mechanical retention for denture teeth include the \nuse of pins placed into the lingual aspect of the teeth. (Cour-\ntesy Preat Corporation, Grover Beach, CA.)\nremoved. Approximately 15 mm of space is needed for an \nimplant bar overdenture with Hader bar or O-Rings.\nVerify Occlusion. The occlusion should always be veriied \nto maintain an even distribution of masticatory force. Any \nprematurities should be eliminated and frequent recall exam-\ninations should be part of the postoperative care.\nIncrease Mechanical Retention. Usually, it is dificult to \nadd mechanical retention into a denture tooth as this will lead \nto stress fractures. Diatoric retention may be utilized with \nPERMA RET system, which involves placing a metal wire into \nthe denture tooth for mechanical retention (Fig. 15.70).\nOVERDENTURE FRACTURES\nA signiicant and often embarrassing complication that may \noccur is the fracture of an overdenture base. This often will \nresult in loss of conidence in the doctor by the patient.\nEtiology\nOcclusal Force. Excessive occlusal force may result in frac-\nture of the denture base. Ideal occlusion and even distribu-\ntion of force is mandatory. If warranted, an occlusal guard \nshould be fabricated.\nThin Acrylic Base. When compromised acrylic thickness is \npresent, this will most likely result in microfractures and \nresultant denture base fracture.\nPrevention\nStrengthen the Denture Base. The denture base may be \nstrengthened with the use of acrylic or meshwork. This will \nresult in fewer fractures to the denture base (Fig. 15.71).\nTreatment Planning. For an overdenture, always make sure \nthere is suficient room for attachment or bar with adequate \nacrylic thickness (Fig. 15.72).\n“LOCKING” DENTURE UNDER BAR LOCKING \nPROSTHESIS IN\nWhen picking up attachments (i.e., cold or light cure) for an \noverdenture, sometimes locking the prosthesis under the bar \nwill occur. This may lead to signiicant complications and \nmorbidity.\nPrevention\nA block-out material should always be used. It is recom-\nmended to use a cellulose-based caulking and block-out \nmaterial that is syringe delivered (e.g., Perma Block [Preat \nCorporation]). These materials will adhere to wet surfaces \nsuch as gingival and mucosal tissues.\nThis material will block-out the undercuts during attach-\nment pick-up or impression procedures. Its heavy body \nwill prevent displacement, which may allow encroachment \nof the autopolymerizing material into the sulcus. An \nair-water syringe along with a brush will assist in removal \n(Fig. 15.73).\nTreatment\nIf the denture is locked under the bar/attachment, careful \naccess to the undercut can be obtained via the use of a diamond \nbur with excess irrigation. This is most likely in the lingual \naspect of the lange, directly over the attachment in question.\nFOOD IMPACTION\nEtiology\nA common compliant of mandibular overdentures is food \nimpaction. Because the langes of the prosthesis do not extend \nto the loor of the mouth in the rest position (to eliminate \nsore spots caused by elevation of the loor of the mouth \nduring swallowing), openings allow for food accumulation \nunder the prosthesis. During mastication, food debris \nmigrates and become impacted under the prosthesis during \nswallowing. A similar condition is found with a traditional \ndenture. When a lower denture “loats” during function, the"

The patient should \nbe informed of food impaction prior to implant placement. An \nRP-4 will tend to accumulate more food impaction because of \nmore implants, larger space at the tissue level, and the ease of \nfood accumulating around the bar (Fig. 15.74)."
