Resnik\n6 \nTo obtain proper esthetics and function of an implant sup-\nported prosthesis, the three-dimensional positioning of the \ndental implant is critical. The malposition of the implant can \nlead to signiicant implant complications and morbidity. In \norder to achieve an ideal result for the patient, a clinician \nmust initially place implants in a correct orientation for the \nprosthesis design. Nonideal implant positioning may result \nin undesirable outcomes that may affect the success and lon-\ngevity of prosthetic rehabilitation.1 Optimal dental implant \npositioning should consider the three-dimensional place-\nment of implants with respect to the biomechanical and \nprosthetic principles related to the inal implant prosthesis. \nRecently, advances in implant dentistry have created a greater \nappreciation for the esthetic results of the implant restora-\ntion. Implant dentistry has experienced a profound shift: \nfrom a functional thought process with a surgical approach \nto esthetics, with a prosthetically and biologically driven \napproach.2 The implant should be positioned in ideal relation \nto existing teeth, vital structures, and other implants as well \nas in buccolingual, mesiodistal, and apicocoronal dimensions. \nWhen implants are malpositioned, any of the following det-\nrimental effects may occur (Fig. 6.1):\n• Increased implant morbidity\n• Increased prosthetic complications (e.g., esthetics, \nprosthesis)\n• Increased prosthetic costs\n• Increased periodontal complications\n• Decreased longevity of prosthesis\nThe ideal three-dimensional positioning of a dental \nimplant needs to be addressed prior to the surgical procedure. \nLack of proper planning leads to malpositioning in the three \nspatial planes (Fig. 6.1). The placement of a dental implant \nin available bone is comparable to an object in space that is \ndeined by “x,” “y,” and “z” coordinates. In implant dentistry, \nthe x-axis is deined by the mesiodistal plane, the y-axis is the \nbuccolingual dimension, and the z-axis is known as the api-\ncocoronal (length of implant body in relation to the osseous \ncrest).3 Placement of dental implants ideally in the available \nbone does not necessarily prevent complications from arising. \nNot only does the implant need to be placed in the ideal \nthree-dimensional position but also according to the type of \ninal prosthesis. In this chapter the proper positioning of \nimplants will be discussed according to the inal prosthetic \ndemands of the patient.\nMESIAL-DISTAL (“X” AXIS):  \nIMPLANT–NATURAL TOOTH\nINSUFFICIENT IMPLANT–ROOT  \nAPEX DISTANCE\nEtiology\nImplants placed too close to an adjacent tooth root are usually \nthe result of poor treatment planning (inadequate space), \npoor surgical technique (improper angulation), or placement \nof too wide of an implant body. This may occur when there \nare root dilacerations of an adjacent tooth or if a tooth has \nbeen orthodontically repositioned to where the tooth root \nhas encroached on the intraroot space (Fig. 6.2A).\nComplications\nDamage to Adjacent Periodontal Ligament. Implants posi-\ntioned too close to a tooth risk damage to the periodontal liga-\nment and surrounding structures. This may cause displacement \nof bone into the periodontal ligament (PDL) space and result \nin altered blood supply to the adjacent tooth, loss of tooth vital-\nity, apical periodontitis, and internal or external resorption.4\nLoss of Implant. Implants that are placed too close to an \nadjacent tooth may fail due to infection or bone resorption. \nIf more than 1.5 mm of space exists between the implant and \nthe adjacent tooth, any bony defect around an implant will \nremain a vertical defect and will ususally not cause bone loss \non the adjacent natural tooth. If bone loss around an implant \nis less than 1.5 mm then the bone on the adjacent tooth will \nmaintain the interdental papilla height.\nLoss of Tooth. If adequate space is not maintained between \na tooth and an implant, the adjacent tooth may be irreversibly \ntraumatized and may be lost to a fracture or to internal or \nexternal resorption (Fig. 6.2B–D).\nPrevention\nIdeal Position. The ideal position is to maintain at least \n1.5 mm from the adjacent tooth root or tooth structure. Ideal \nangulation should be strictly adhered to by evaluating initial \nosteotomy position via a radiograph of a direction indicator \nafter the irst pilot drill (Fig. 6.3A)."

A common problem is when positional (fully limiting) \nsurgical guides are made from study casts without three-\ndimensional evaluation (Fig. 6.3B–C).\nTwo-Dimensional Radiographs. In evaluation of intraroot \ndistances, caution must be used in using two-dimensional \nradiographs as the sole determinants of implant positioning. \nBoth periapical and panoramic radiographs have inherent \ndisadvantages in providing accurate measurements (Fig. \n6.4A). Ideally, to verify adequate intraroot distance, a three-\ndimensional (computed tomography [CT] or cone beam \ncomputed tomography [CBCT]) scan should be performed. \nAccurate measurements may be made in the axial images at \nthree locations: the cementoenamel junction (CEJ), midroot, \nand root apex (Fig. 6.4B–E).\nCaution With Orthodontic Implants. A popular relatively \nnew implant modality is the use of orthodontic implants \ntemporary anchorage devices (TADs) for anchorage. Orth-\nodontic implants utilize the use of smaller diameter implants, \nwhich are inserted perpendicular to the long axis of the tooth \nin the interradicular spaces of the maxilla and mandible. \nTADs are utilized for tooth movement (e.g., labial segment \nretraction or mesial movement of teeth) or for intraoral \nanchorage, in which tooth movement in all three planes may \nbe accomplished. Interradicular orthodontic implant compli-\ncations include loss of tooth vitality, tooth loss, osteosclerosis, \nand dentoalveolar ankylosis.5,6 These implants should be cau-\ntiously placed because they often are placed in areas of \nminimal intraroot distance and above the mucogingival line \nin attached tissue, which often leads to detrimental effects on \nadjacent tooth structure (Fig. 6.5A–B).7\nMaxillary Lateral Incisor Region. In regards to implant \nposition, one of the most common problematic areas is the \nreplacement of congenitally missing lateral incisors. Often \nafter orthodontic treatment, there exists a normal mesiodistal \ndistance of the clinical crowns; however, compromised intra-\nroot distance will result. This is most likely to occur in the \napical area. Lack of space may contraindicate implant place-\nment or require orthodontic treatment for repositioning of \nthe roots (see Fig. 6.4).\nMaxillary First Premolar Site. Another common area for \nroot approximation problems is in the maxillary irst premo-\nlar edentulous site. Careful consideration for the angulation \nof a natural canine must be evaluated. The 11-degree average \ndistal inclination and distal curvature of the canine root fre-\nquently place the apex of the root into the irst premolar \nimplant area. The implant should be angled to follow the root \nof the canine and prevent contact with or perforation of the \nnatural root. A shorter implant often is indicated, especially \nwhen a second premolar is also present (Fig. 6.5C–D).\nFP-2, FP-3, RP-4, and RP-5. More latitude exists with the \nmesiodistal positioning of implants for FP-2, FP-3, RP-4, and \nProper Treatment Planning. The exact measurement of \nintraroot distance should be determined to prevent implant \napproximation to the root. Additionally, evaluation for ana-\ntomic variants such as dilacerations of adjacent teeth should \nalways be radiographically diagnosed. The use of CBCT \nimages should be utilized to conirm exact space available \nbetween the root and intended implant position. The most \naccurate CBCT image is the axial slice, which can be easily \nused to verify measurements.\nUse of Study Casts. Study casts should not be used as the \nsole determinate of implant position.

Because the soft tissue is replaced \nin these types of prostheses (pink acrylic or porcelain), implants \nneed not be placed in speciic tooth positions. Implant posi-\ntioning is usually dictated by 3-mm spacing between implants \nand maximizing the A-P spread whenever possible.\nTreatment\nInitial Placement. If there is insuficient space between an \nimplant and a natural tooth, the implant should be removed \nand repositioned, especially if the adjacent tooth is symptom-\natic. If space is compromised (<6.0 mm), the roots should be \nrepositioned via orthodontics or treatment plan changed to \na different type of prosthesis.\nPast Placement. If an implant has been restored and root \napproximation (<1.5 mm) exists, the tooth/implant should \nbe monitored on a regular basis and the patient informed of \nthe possible morbidity. If symptomatic or radiographic \npathology is present, the implant should be removed and \nrepositioned along with vitality testing of the tooth.\nLACK OF IMPLANT–CORONAL DISTANCE\nEtiology\nLack of space between the implant platform and the coronal \naspect of the adjacent tooth occurs most likely from poor \ninitial osteotomy positioning, poor treatment planning, or \nthe use of too large of an implant body, leading to a situation \nwhere the implant encroaches upon the adjacent tooth. \nImplant clinicians must be aware that most implant crestal \nplatforms are larger than the implant body, which will \nresult in decreased space between the adjacent tooth (e.g., a \n3.8-mm implant may have a 4.1-mm platform) (Fig. 6.6 and \nTable 6.1).\nComplications\nIf implants are positioned too close to the coronal portion of \nthe tooth, many complications can result.\nInterproximal Bone Loss. When there is a lack of space \nbetween the tooth and implant, bone resorption will occur \ndue to lack of a suficient blood supply. Esposito has shown"

Without \nevaluating the third dimension, it is impossible to determine the exact root position. \nA\nB\nC\nHygiene Dificulties. Because of the unnatural contours of \nthe prosthesis and the lack of space for cleansibility, proper \nhygiene techniques will be dificult. This will result in plaque \nbuildup and related periodontal complications.\nReduced Papilla Height. Because of interproximal bone \nloss due to the proximity of the implant to the coronal portion \nof the tooth, a lack of or reduction in the size of papilla will \nbe present. This will result in periodontal conditions and \nesthetic issues (Fig. 6.7D).\nPrevention\nTreatment Planning. The use of an accurate radiographic \nmodality (CBCT) is paramount in determining if suficient \nspace exists for ideal clinical crown size (measurement on \naxial slices). Additionally, a study cast and diagnostic wax-up \nmay be utilized. Ideally, 1.5 to 2.0 mm should be present from \nthe implant neck to the adjacent tooth (Fig. 6.8).\nPreoperative Modiication. Upon preoperative evaluation, if \ninadequate space exists for implant treatment, the following \noptions may be completed to increase mesiodistal distance:\n1.

When an implant is to \nbe placed adjacent to a tooth, a tooth-supported guide is the \nmost accurate in comparison to bone- or tissue-borne guides \n(see Fig. 6.10A–B, E).\nTreatment\nInitial Placement. If nonideal placement is determined \nduring surgery, the implant should be repositioned in the \nideal position (i.e., 2 mm from adjacent tooth). The osteot-\nomy should be initiated with the following formula:\n1\n2\n2 0\ndiameter of the implant\nmm from tooth\n+ .\nIn other words, a 4.0-mm implant pilot osteotomy would \nbe 2.0 mm + 2.0 mm = 4.0 mm from the adjacent tooth. \nIf the initial osteotomy is not ideal, a Lindemann drill (side \ncutting) is used to reposition the osteotomy into the correct \nposition.\nPast Placement. If the implant has already been placed and \nis ready to be restored, the amount of occlusal force should \nbe assessed to determine the ideal treatment:\nMinimal Occlusal Forces: If favorable force factors exist, then \na cantilever (overcontoured crown) may be fabricated \nwith (Fig. 6.15A):\n• Narrow occlusal table\n• Minimal cusp height: It has been reported that every \n10-degree increase in cusp inclination leads to a 30% \nincrease in the torque applied to the restoration during \nfunction10\n• No lateral contacts\nHigh Occlusal Forces: If unfavorable forces are present, a \ncantilever is contraindicated and the mesiodistal distance \nis reduced by either:\n• Overcontouring adjacent crown (e.g., crown, composite) \n(Fig. 6.15B)\n• Remove implant and reposition\nMESIAL-DISTAL (“X” AXIS): \nIMPLANT–IMPLANT\nLACK OF IMPLANT-IMPLANT DISTANCE\nEtiology\nWhen implants are placed too close together, it is usually \nthe result of poor treatment planning or surgical technique \n(Fig. 6.16). Treatment planning issues can be prevented by \nusing ideal spacing rules. The guidelines include approxi-\nmately 3.0 mm between implants, and >1.5 to 2.0 mm from \nadjacent teeth.\nComplications\nBone Loss. Because of the lack of interproximal bone a \ndecreased blood supply will result in bone loss. Tarnow et al \nhave shown that implants placed less than 3.0 mm apart may \nligament, there is no stress release system in place to protect \nthe implant. Weinberg et al have shown a 10-degree increase \nin cusp inclination leads to a 30% increase in the force applied \nto the restoration. Additionally, studies have shown that a \n10-degree increase in implant inclination can lead to a 5% \nincrease in force-related function.10 A 1-mm increase in the \nhorizontal offset of an implant restoration may produce a \n15% increase in torque during function, and a 1-mm increase \nin the vertical offset introduces a 5% increase (Fig. 6.13).11 \nThe overcontoured crown leads to resultant shear forces, \nwhich may lead to component failure (i.e., screw loosening, \nscrew fracture, implant fracture).\nFood Impaction. Food impaction is a common complaint \nfrom patients with an increased implant-tooth distance \nbecause periodontal maintenance is dificult as a result of \nrelated soft tissue complications.\nPeriodontal Complications. Because of dificulty in hygiene, \nchronic tissue problems often result, which may cause perimu-\ncositis or peri-implantitis, leading to implant morbidity (see \nFigs. 6.11–6.12).\nPrevention\nPositioning Devices. Prevention for malpositioning may \ninclude the use of special positioning devices that allow for \nideal osteotomy placement and adherence to the ideal place-\nment of 1.5 to 2.0 mm from the adjacent tooth. These prede-\ntermined distance spacers will minimize the possibility of \nplacing the implant too close or too far from the adjacent \ntooth (Fig. 6.14).\nFIG 6.11 Illustration depicting implant placement too far from \na tooth (mesial) leading to a cantilever effect and biomechni-\ncal issues."

In some situations, \nthe abutment/implant body may be minimally modiied to \ngain extra space, usually with a lame-shaped diamond \nbur. This is best completed with external hex implants \nbecause modiication of internal hex implants may alter \nstructural integrity of the implant leading to possible fracture \n(Fig. 6.18C).\nIMPLANT ANGULATION POSITIONING  \n(“Y” AND “Z” AXIS)\nBUCCOLINGUALLY (“Y-AXIS”)\nThe buccolingual positioning of the dental implant is crucial \nto the esthetic and biomechanical effectiveness of the inal \nprosthesis. Frequently, implant positioning is dictated by the \nresulting available bone, leading to angulation complications. \nBone remodeling after tooth extractions is common with \nresorption occurring from the buccal plate initially, thereby \ndecreasing the width of bone. Ideally, the implant position is \nin the center of the ridge, with a minimum of 1.5 mm present \non the buccal and 0.5 mm on the lingual aspects of the ridges \n(Fig. 6.18). When present, adequate cortical bone minimizes \nfuture hard and soft tissue recession. In this scenario, if bone \nloss occurs on the implant, the facial plate will remain intact \nand minimal recession on the facial aspect of the implant will \nresult. Spray et al have shown if the facial bone is more than \n1.8 mm in thickness (after implant placement), recession \ninfrequently results. However, if the facial plate is less than \n1.8 mm, vertical resorption occurs quickly, mainly because of \nthe lack of blood supply (Fig. 6.19).13 Improper buccal-lingual \npositioning has a direct impact on the type prosthesis, and \nresultant complications are prosthesis-dependent.\nFp-1 and Fp-2 Prosthesis\nPrevention\nCement-retained (anterior). When a FP-1 prosthesis is \nindicated, precise implant placement is necessary to obtain an \nideal result. In the anterior region, the ideal implant position \nallows the placement of a straight abutment directly under the \nincisal edge of the inal crown for a cemented prosthesis. The \nresulting forces are concentrated along the long axis of \nthe implant, minimizing damaging shear forces. For example, \nthe natural maxillary anterior teeth are loaded at a 12- to \n15-degree angle, mainly because of their natural angulation in \ncomparison with the mandibular anterior teeth. This is one \nreason the maxillary anterior teeth are wider in diameter than \nmandibular anterior teeth (which are loaded in their long \naxis). The facial angulation position of the implant body often \ncorresponds to an implant body angulation, with 15-degree \noff-axial loads. The angled load will result in an approximate \n25% increase in force to the implant prosthesis. Many com-\nplications may occur from the offset loads, which include \nabutment screw–implant–bone complex by 25.9% compared \nwith a long-axis load.14 Abutment screw loosening, crestal"

Facial positioning is \noften a complication when implants are placed in immediate \nextraction sites.\nTo correct the facial position of the implant, an angled \nabutment must be used. However, because of the access hole, \nthe facial of the abutment is more bulky. This results in over-\ncontouring of the facial aspect, which will lead to tissue reces-\nsion and bone loss (Fig. 6.20).\nLingual. Implants placed too far to the lingual can result \nin facial overcontouring of the inal prosthesis (ridge lap) for \nesthetic reasons. The prosthetic impression and placement of \nthe prosthesis is also complicated, which results in dificulty \nwith the seating of the abutments. Because of the overcon-\ntouring of the lingual contours, patients often complain of \nlack of space for the tongue, which may impede speech.

For screw-retained prostheses \nthe implant should emerge toward the cingulum of the ante-\nrior tooth so that the access hole does not affect the esthetics \nof the restoration.

This may interfere with phonetics, and often \npatients will complain of lack of space for the tongue. If the \nlingual aspect of the denture is thinned too much during \nadjustment, this will result in an area of possible fracture.\nFacial. Implants placed too far facially will interfere with \nideal denture tooth placement, leading to possible denture \ntooth “pop offs.” In addition, facially positioned implants \noften result in lack of adequate attached tissue and potential \nperiodontal concerns because gingival irritation and reces-\nsion are more likely to result. This may lead to chronic pain, \nand remediation is usually unsuccessful (Fig. 6.23).\nAPICOCORONAL (Z-AXIS)\nThe depth of implant placement is signiicant in relation to \ncomplications. Whether placed too deep or not apical enough, \nprosthetic and periodontal complications may increase \nimplant morbidity.\nThere exists much controversy in implant dentistry regard-\ning the placement level of an implant. Some authors have \nsuggested that the implant be countersunk below the crestal \nbone more than 4 mm below the facial CEJ of the adjacent \nteeth to develop a crown emergence proile similar to a \nnatural tooth, to prevent soft tissue recession, and to support \nthe tissue of the adjacent natural teeth.16,17 In theory, this \nprovides an emergence transition of approximately 5 mm \non the facial aspect to obtain the width of the natural tooth \n(the ideal free gingival margin on the facial is 1 mm above \nthe CEJ).\nThe ideal crown height space (CHS) for a ixed prosthesis \nis between 8 and 12 mm, accounting for an ideal 3 mm of \nsoft tissue, 2 mm of occlusal material thickness, and a 5 mm \nor greater abutment height. A CHS greater than 12 mm may \nbe of concern in ixed restorations. The replacement teeth are \nelongated (FP2 or FP3) and often require the addition of \ngingival tone materials in esthetic regions. The greater impact \nforce on implants compared with teeth, combined with the \nincreased crown height, creates increased moment forces on \nimplants and carries the risks of uncemented or unretained \nprostheses as well as component and material fracture. These \nproblems are more problematic when associated with less \nfavorable biomechanics on cantilevered sections of ixed res-\ntorations.18 In case of excessive CHS, bone augmentation may \nbe preferred to prosthetic replacement, especially in type C−h \nor D bone volumes. Surgical augmentation of the residual \nridge height reduces the CHS and improves implant biome-\nchanics by both position and number. Augmentation often \npermits the placement of wider-body implants with the asso-\nciated beneit of increased surface area. Prosthetics is the \nmost commonly used option to address excess CHS; however, \nit should ideally be the last choice. Using gingival-colored \nprosthetic materials (pink porcelain or acrylic resin) on ixed \nrestorations or changing the prosthetic design to a removable \nrestoration should often be considered when the prosthesis is \nused to restore excessive CHS with unfavorable conditions.\nIn regards to the effects of CHS on papilla form, Tarnow \net al have shown that if the bone level to the contact area is \nless than 5 mm, 98 % of the time the embrasure space will be \nilled in. If the distance increases to 6 and 7 mm, the presence \nof a papilla reduces to 56% and 27%, respectively (Fig. 6.24).19"

Caution must be exercised to \nensure there is adequate interocclusal space for the overden-\nture prosthesis, especially if a connecting bar is used. For a \nbar and overdenture with attachments, at least 15 mm from \nthe crest of the ridge to the incisal edge is suggested. If inter-\nocclusal space is needed, an osteoplasty at the time of surgery \nshould be completed to increase space for the inal prosthesis. \nInteractive treatment planning may be used to fabricate a \nreduction guide, which will allow the implant clinician to \nremove the ideal amount of bone. A minimum of 2.0 mm of \nacrylic is required to adequately retain denture teeth and \nmaintain structural integrity of the prosthesis.\nComplications\nMore than 15 mm. For an RP-5 prosthesis, greater inter-\nocclusal space is usually not problematic because of the soft \ntissue support. However, with an RP-4 (implant supported)\nprosthesis, greater interocclusal space may pose a problem \nwith increased “rocking” of the prosthesis because of the \nlack of soft tissue support (i.e., RP-4 is completely implant \nsupported). With removable prostheses, two prosthetic \nlevels of height should be taken into consideration. The irst \nis the height of the attachment system to the crest of the \nbone. The greater the height distance, the greater the forces \napplied to the bar, screws, and implant structures. The \nsecond CHS to consider is the distance from the attachment \nto the occlusal plane. This distance represents the increase in \nprosthetic forces applied to the attachment. For example, in \na CHS of 15 mm, a locator attachment may be 7 mm from \nthe crest of bone, resulting in a lever action of 7 mm applied \nto the implants. The distance from the rotation point of the \nlocator attachment to the occlusal plane may be an addi-\ntional 8 mm. Under these conditions, a greater lever action \nis applied to the prosthesis than to the implant interface. \nThis results in increased instability of the restoration under \nlateral forces.20\nTreatment. If more than 15 mm of space is present, a RP-5 \nprosthesis should have ideal interocclusal space for the inal \nprosthesis. Peripheral extension and the primary stress-\nbearing area support (maxilla—horizontal palate; mandible—\nbuccal shelf) should be utilized to decrease excessive loading \nforce. The occlusion should include bilateral balanced con-\ntacts with no occlusal prematurities. If excessive force exists, \n(i.e., excessive CHS and/or parafunction) an RP-4 (totally \nimplant supported) may be changed to an RP-5 (soft tissue \nsupported) to decrease the force.\nComplications\nLess than 15 mm. When suficient CHS is lacking and \nthe prosthesis is more prone to component fatigue and frac-\nture, an overdenture is more dificult to fabricate than a \nporcelain-to-metal ixed prosthesis. The 15-mm minimum \nCHS provides adequate bulk of acrylic to resist fracture, space \nto set denture teeth without modiication, and room for \nattachments, bars, soft tissue, and hygiene. In the mandible, \nthe soft tissue is often 1 to 3 mm in thickness above the \nbone, so the occlusal plane to soft tissue should be at least \n9 to 11 mm in height. An osteoplasty to increase CHS \nbefore implant placement or a ixed restoration is often \nindicated when abundant bone height and width are present \n(Fig. 6.29).\nTreatment. If less than 15 mm of CHS is present, an RP-4 \nand RP-5 may present issues. Without suficient space for \ntissue health, attachment space, bulk of acrylic, and non-\nmodiied denture teeth, the overdenture may undergo fatigue \nand possible fractures. An RP-4 may be changed to an RP-5 \nto obtain soft tissue support to minimize forces to the attach-\nments. Additionally, the overdenture prosthesis should be \nchanged to a metal base, metal reinforced, or iber mesh to \nincrease the strength of the prosthesis to prevent prosthesis \nfracture.\nDISTANCE FROM VITAL STRUCTURES\nIMPLANT POSITION\nInferior Alveolar Nerve Canal or Mental Foramen\nAccurate positioning of implants in approximation to the \ninferior alveolar canal and mental foramen is crucial in pre-\nventing neurosensory impairment. The correct location of \nthe nerve and canal should ideally be ascertained via three-\ndimensional imaging, especially when the implant may be \nwithin 2 mm of the nerve. After identiication of the vital \nstructures, the implant should be placed greater than 2 mm \nfrom the inferior alveolar canal or mental foramen. Implant \nplacement less than 2 mm increases the risk of compression \nor traumatic injuries to the nerve trunk, which may result in \nneurosensory deicits (Fig. 6.30).\nInferior Border of Mandible\nPlacement of dental implants in the anterior mandible can \nlead to signiicant and even life-threatening complications. \nCare should be noted to evaluate the angulation and trajec-\ntory of the anterior mandible with three-dimensional imaging \nto minimize the possibility of perforating the lingual cortex. \nTwo-dimensional radiographs (i.e., panoramic) may lead to \nfalse representation of the amount of bone available. If the \ninferior border of the mandible is perforated, bleeding may \nbecome evident from the sublingual and submental blood \nvessels. Because this area is dificult to obtain access to, dan-\ngerous sublingual bleeding complications may arise (See \nChapter 7) (Fig. 6.31).\nNasal Cavity\nThe anterior maxilla is often a very challenging area to place \nimplants. Because of the compromised bone in width and \nheight, along with angulation issues, implants are often mal-\npositioned.

(From \nMisch CE: Contemporary implant dentistry, ed 3, St Louis, 2008, Mosby.)\nin this area because of bone loss and pneumatization of the \nmaxillary sinus. There are four treatment options (Misch \nClassiication) for implants placed in this area with respect to \nthe quantity of bone from the crest of the ridge to the inferior \nborder of the sinus (Fig. 6.33)15:\n1. SA-1: Greater than 12 mm of bone; a standard implant \nplacement protocol is indicated\n2. SA-2: When 10 to 12 mm of bone is present and the \nimplant is placed along with antral loor elevation \nthrough the osteotomy site 0 to 2 mm\n3. SA-3: When 5 to 10 mm of bone is present, sinus graft-\ning is indicated with (SA-3I) or without (SA-3D) \nsimultaneous implant placement.\n4. SA-4: Less than 5 mm of bone is present, which neces-\nsitates a lateral wall sinus augmentation procedure \nbefore implant placement.\nMALPOSITIONING COMPLICATION \nSUMMARY\nPREVENTION\nIdeal Treatment Planning\nThe surest way to minimize prevent errors in angulation \nduring implant surgery is to develop a comprehensive strat-\negy during the preoperative assessment phase of treatment. \nCBCT analysis offers the clinician an excellent evaluation of \nthe patient’s anatomy to properly plan implant position, \ndiameter, and length helping prevent positional, spacing, and \ndepth issues.\nIdeal Available Bone\nThe amount of available bone width (faciopalatal) should be \nat least 2.0 mm greater than the implant diameter at implant \ninsertion. A 3.5-mm implant requires at least 5.5 mm of bone \nwidth (minimum). Augmentation has become very predict-\nable and accepted in the profession, therefore the clinician \nshould never compromise when adequate bone is not avail-\nable. Various bone grating techniques and materials are avail-\nable that the clinician should implement in treating these \ncompromised cases.\nUnderstanding the Prosthesis Type and \nAssociated Ideal Positioning\nWhen treatment planning, the inal prosthesis should always \nbe evaluated irst, prior to implant placement. The implant \nclinician must have a strong understanding of the various \nprosthesis types (e.g., FP-1, FP-2, FP-3, RP-4, RP-5) along \nwith the positional and prosthesis demands and needs. The \nprosthesis type (ixed [FP-1, FP-2, FP-3] or removable [RP-4, \nRP-5]) dictates the ideal placement of implants. The implant \nclinician must understand that positioning changes as per the \ntype of prosthesis.\nSoft Tissue Evaluation\nThe biotype (thin vs. thick) bone should always be evaluated \nprior to implant placement.

Additionally, the adjacent teeth should \nbe evaluated for periapical pathology, as this may lead to a \nretrograde peri-implantitis.\nGood Surgical Technique\nTo minimize the possibility of improper angulation, the \nimplant clinician should evaluate the osteotomy angulation \nafter the use of the irst pilot drill. Usually, the pilot drill is \nused to a depth of 6 to 8 mm. A direction indicator is placed, \nand should be evaluated both radiographically and with a \nsurgical template for proper positioning. The position can \nalso be evaluated by having the patient close lightly to deter-\nmine the interocclusal positioning with the direction indica-\ntor. Any modiications of the angulation should be completed \nwith a Lindemann drill.\nPoorly Dense Bone\nIn poorly dense bone (≈D4), overpreparation of the osteot-\nomy site may lead to redirection of the implant upon place-\nment. Additionally, implants should be inserted with a \nhandpiece instead of by hand ratcheting. When implants are \nplaced in poorly dense bone with a ratchet, the implant may \nbe easily redirectioned by placing in a more elliptical \ndirection.\nUnderstand the True Location of Vital Structures\nKnowing the exact location of the vital structures is para-\nmount in avoiding complications. Impinging on vital struc-\ntures such as the mandibular canal, maxillary sinus, or nasal \ncavity may increase morbidity and place the patient at risk \nfor irreversible complications.\nUse of Surgical Templates\nA surgical template is deined by the prosthodontics glossary \nas a guide used to assist in ideal surgical placement and angu-\nlation of dental implants.22 The objective of using a surgical \ntemplate is to provide accurate placement of the implant \naccording to a surgical treatment. There are many different \ntypes of surgical templates used today. Stumpel classiied sur-\ngical templates according to the amount of surgical restric-\ntion that is utilized in the template. The categories are: (1) \nnonlimiting, (2) partial limiting, and (3) complete limiting \ndesign.23\nNonlimiting Design. The nonlimiting template allows the \nimplant surgeon dimensional variability in the implant loca-\ntion because the template indicates the ideal space (location) \nfor the inal restoration, not the actual mesiodistal angula-\ntion. The nonlimiting template has become popular because \nof the ease in fabrication and the low cost involved.\nComplication. These templates allow the implant surgeon \nonly an initial location of the proposed prosthesis, not the \ncorrect angulation (buccal-lingual) and position (mesiodis-\ntal). A great deal of lexibility and latitude regarding the inal \nposition of the implant is inherent with this type of template \n(Fig. 6.34).\nPartial Limiting Design. The partial limiting design incor-\nporates a guided sleeve or a slot that allows for angulation \nof one drill size, usually the pilot drill. After the irst drill \nis used, the rest of the osteotomy sites are completed free-\nhand. Various techniques can be utilized in fabricating a \npartial limiting template including manual laboratory-\nfabricated templates or templates fabricated from a radio-\ngraphic template, which is then converted into a surgical \nguide template.\nComplication. Although the partial limiting design is \nmore accurate than a nonlimiting design, these templates \nstill do not allow for inal, accurate positioning of the implant. \nClinical studies have shown these types of templates to \nhave high degree of error in the buccal-lingual orientation \n(Fig. 6.35).24\nComplete Limiting Design. With the complete limiting \ntemplate design, the position, angulation, and depth of the \nosteotomy are dictated by the guided tubes or sleeves, thus \nrestricting any variation by the implant surgeon.

Even though CBCT surgical templates are \nhighly accurate, there are inherent errors that may occur \nwhen placing dental implants, which will result in malposi-\ntioning of the implants. Studies have shown that tooth-\nsupported guides are the most accurate, followed by bone \nsupported, with the least accurate being soft tissue–supported. \nThis is mainly due to the questionable stability of the tem-\nplate during the CBCT scan and the implant placement with \ntissue supported templates. Bone-supported templates fre-\nquently result in malpositioning because of bony interfer-\nences and inability to seat the template completely.

However, on occasion \na signiicant bleeding episode may occur. The most common \nsources of intraoperative bleeding include incision into \nhighly vascularized areas of the mucosa or periosteum, ana-\ntomic vascular variants, areas of infection, and trauma to \nnutrient arteries in the alveolar bone. The implant clinician \nmust be able to identify and understand the source of the \nbleeding, which may occur from many different types of \nbleeding episodes. These include hemorrhage from small \nvessels, large vessels, oozing, medication-induced bleeding, or \ncoagulopathies.\nThe management of hemostasis during dental implant \nsurgery has many key factors, the irst of which is an accurate \npreoperative assessment of the patient followed by good surgi-\ncal technique. If a bleeding episode occurs, the implant clinician \nmust be able to utilize various hemostatic agents if traditional \nmethods fail. These agents may range from absorbable hemo-\nstats, such as gelatins and collagens, to biologically active topical \nhemostats, such as thrombin and combined agents. However, \nthe implant clinician must irst have a thorough understanding \nof all aspects of hemostasis cycle. With this knowledge the clini-\ncian will be in a better position to avoid bleeding episodes and \nmore importantly, will also have the ability to act decisively and \nskillfully during a potential “slippery slope” and scenario with \nsigniicant medical implications. It is not always possible to \navoid bleeding complications, but it is of paramount impor-\ntance to be able to treat them effectively.\nRISK OF BLEEDING\nBleeding during dental implant surgery poses many potential \ncomplications for the patient and the dental implant surgeon. \nThese include an obscured surgical ield, prolonged surgical \ntime, increased the risk of physiologic complications, and \nincreased procedural morbidity (Fig. 7.1). Surgical bleeding \nmay be classiied in various ways according to the source or \nonset (Box 7.1).\nMechanism of Hemostasis\nUnderstanding the mechanism of hemostasis is crucial to the \nsurgical treatment of the dental implant patient. Hemostasis \nis deined as a highly regulated process that maintains blood \nlow through the vasculature simultaneously as a thrombotic \nresponse to the tissue damage.2 Biologically, hemostasis \nrequires a complex cascade of interactions involving the \nvessel wall, platelets, and ibrin coagulation and ibrinolytic \nsystems. For this to occur, there are three reactions—primary, \nsecondary, and tertiary—that act simultaneously (Fig. 7.2).\nVascular and Platelet Activity (Primary Hemostasis). The \nirst phase of hemostasis occurs immediately after blood vessel \ndamage as a result of vasoconstriction. This reduces blood \nlow, limits the amount of blood loss, enhances platelet adher-\nence, and activates coagulation.3 Vasoconstriction is triggered \nby direct injury to vascular smooth muscle, chemicals released \nby endothelial cells and platelets, and relexes initiated by pain \nreceptors. This spasm response becomes greater as injury \nincreases and is more effective on smaller blood vessels.4 \nMechanical blockage occurs by platelets adhering to exposed \ncollagen (platelet adhesion), which release cytokines (sero-\ntonin, thromboxane A2, and endothelin1) into the area of \ntissue injury.3 This plug formation is activated by von Wille-\nbrand factor (vWF), a glycoprotein found in plasma. The \nplatelets forming the plug will release chemical messengers \nsuch as adenosine diphosphate (ADP), ibronectin, thrombo-\nspondin, ibrinogen and PDGF, which causes more platelets to \naggregate and enhance vascular spasms.5 As more platelets \nadhere and release their chemicals, a positive feedback loop \nresults, which ends in the formation of a platelet plug. Drugs \nthat affect primary hemostasis include aspirin and clopido-\ngrel, which affect platelet function and prevent thrombosis.\nBlood Coagulation (Secondary Hemostasis). The second \nstep in the process of hemostasis occurs when the clotting \nfactors within the blood plasma form a collagen iber called \nibrin. This ibrin forms a mesh, collecting red and white \nblood cells that strengthen the clot, which is termed the coag-\nulation cascade.6 The coagulation cascade is divided into three \npathways, the intrinsic pathway, extrinsic pathway, and coag-\nulation cascade.\nThe intrinsic pathway (contact activation pathway) \nrequires clotting factors VII, IX, X, XI, and XII as well as \nproteins and calcium ions and phospholipids secreted by \nplatelets. This pathway has a less signiicant effect on hemo-\nstasis in comparisons to the extrinsic pathway under normal \nphysiologic conditions.\nThe extrinsic pathway (tissue factor pathway) is the main \npathway that generates a “thrombin burst,” which involves a \nfeedback activation role where thrombin is released rapidly."

Thus the ibrin clot, the inal product of coagulation, is \nbroken down (ibrinolysis). A drug that inhibits the tertiary \nhemostasis is tranexamic acid.8\nFACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO \nINTRAOPERATIVE BLEEDING\nMany factors may contribute to intraoperative bleeding. The \nincidence of bleeding episodes during dental surgery has \nbeen shown to be up to 4% of patients exhibiting normal \nhemostasis. In chronically anticoagulated patients, studies \nhave shown bleeding episodes to be in the range of 8.6% to \n32.1%.9 Although rare, bleeding during dental implant \nsurgery may be life threatening. The implant clinician must \nbe conscious of the signs and symptoms of a potential bleed-\ning emergency. If the patient displays any signs of shock \n(tachycardia, hypotension, cold/clammy skin, lethargy), \nimmediate medical assistance is recommended along with \nThrombin activates factors V and VII, which in turn activate \nother factors to continue the coagulation process.\nCommon pathway involves factor X generation of throm-\nbin from prothrombin. Thrombin then activates factors XI \nand VIII, which amplify the coagulation cascade, releasing \nmore thrombin. Thrombin then causes ibrinogen to form, \nwhich results in cross-linked ibrin. Drugs that effect second-\nary hemostasis include warfarin, the direct thrombin inhibi-\ntors, and heparin5,7 (Fig. 7.3).\nFibrinolysis (Tertiary Hemostasis).

In \nmost cases of Coumadin-based medications, discontinuation \nis not recommended for routine dental implant procedures \nbecause local hemostatic measures are effective in managing \nhemorrhage.

Antiplatelet medications affect \nclotting by inhibiting platelet aggregation; however, this \noccurs by many different mechanisms. Aspirin irreversibly \nacetylates cyclooxygenase, thus inhibiting the production of \nthromboxane A2, and clopidogrel (Plavix) selectively inhibits \nADP. Thus both have the end result of reducing platelet \naggregation. Both of these drugs will affect the platelet func-\ntion for the life of a platelet, which is 7–10 days. The synthesis \nof new platelets will overcome the platelet dysfunction, and \nin 50% to 80% of cases, platelet aggregation returns to normal \n(Table 7.3).11\nThe combination of aspirin and clopidogrel produces \nadditive and possible synergistic effects because the two med-\nications block complementary pathways in the platelet aggre-\ngation cascade. Rarely will physicians allow the complete \nwithdrawal of both of these medications as the cardioprotec-\ntive beneits outweigh the potential for bleeding episodes in \nat-risk patients with cardiovascular disease.\nNonsteroidal Anti-Inlammatory Drugs (NSAIDs).

MEDICATIONS (BASED ON PHYSICIAN RECOMMEN-\nDATION)\n• In most cases, do not interrupt thrombocyte aggregate \ninhibitors (e.g., aspirin, clopidogrel).\n• Do not interrupt warfarin if INR <3.0.\n• Physician consult for direct thrombin inhibitors (e.g., \napixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban).

PRESURGICAL INTERVENTION\n• Inform patients of the entire procedure and not to inter-\nrupt any of their medications unless they receive physi-\ncian approval.\n• Warfarin patients should have their INR checked within \n48 hours of the surgical procedure unless they have \nstable values. INR above 3.0 should be a relative contra-\nindication to the surgical procedure requiring physician \nconsultation.\n3. INTRAOPERATIVE MEASURES\n• Minimize surgical trauma and utilize good surgical \ntechnique.\n• Reduce surgical time and minimize surgical sites to be \ntreated (schedule into multiple surgeries).\n• Good suturing technique to include primary closure with \nhigh–tensile strength suture (e.g., Vicryl).\n• Minimize trauma on surgical site from prosthesis.\n4. POSTOPERATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS\n• Utilize pressure packs and hemostatic agents if \nnecessary.\n• Minimize the use of aspirin, NSAIDs, and COX-2 inhibi-\ntors as analgesics.\n• Provide \ndetailed \noral \nand \nwritten \npostoperative \ninstructions.\n• More frequent postoperative appointments.\nCOX-2, cyclooxygenase-2; INR, international normalized ratio; \nNSAID, nonsteroidal antiinlammatory drug.\nTABLE 7.4 Herbal Supplements That \nInhibit Hemostasis7\nHerbal\nSource\nBilberry\nVaccinium myrtillus\nBromelain\nAnas comosus\nCat’s claw\nUncaria tomentosa\nDevil’s claw\nHarpagophytum procumbens\nDong quai\nAngelica sinensis\nEvening primrose\nOenothera biennis\nFeverfew\nTanacetum parthenium\nGarlic\nAllium sativum\nGinger\nZingiber oficinale\nGinkgo biloboa\nGinkgo biloba\nGinseng\nPanax ginseng\nGrape seed\nVitis vinifera\nGreen tea\nCamellia sinensis\nHorse chestnut\nAesculus hippocastanum\nTurmeric\nCurcuma longa\nbecause of product variability and minimal regulation.

Some of these supplements may prolong bleed-\ning and impair the coagulation process, which may lead \nto intraoperative and postoperative bleeding episodes \n(Table 7.4). Supplements should be withdrawn for a minimum \nof 2 weeks prior to surgery.\nSystemic Bleeding Disorders\nFactor Disorders. Bleeding disorders may directly or indi-\nrectly affect the intrinsic or extrinsic pathways of the hemo-\nstasis process. The intrinsic pathway affects the activated \npartial thromboplastin time (aPTT) via factors VII, IX, XI, \nXII and the extrinsic pathway involves factor VII, which \naffects the prothrombin time (PT). Any of these intrinsic or \nextrinsic factors may affect the common pathway, which \nalters the formation of the ibrin clot. Usually laboratory tests \nsuch as partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and PT will reveal \nthe factor deiciency.\nBesides factor disorders, there are also congenital disorders \nthat impact hemostasis. Hemophilia is a bleeding disorder \nthat may be very minor or can be a more severe type leading \nto signiicant complications. Hemophilia can be classiied \ninto type A (Factor VIII) or type B (Factor IX). von Wille-\nbrand disease is an inherited disorder that results from the \nlack of von Willebrand factor, which is a protein within the \nblood that assists with blood clotting and carrying clotting \nfactors.11 With any type of systemic bleeding disorder, physi-\ncian consultation is highly recommended (Box 7.2).\nLiver Disorders. Liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis, acute liver \nfailure) is associated with many signiicant abnormalities of \nthe coagulation system. The coagulation system and the \ninterrelationship with liver function is very complex. \nBecause most patients exhibiting liver disease have impaired \nproduction of coagulation factors and thrombocytopenia, \nmedical consultation before any dental implant procedure is \nrecommended.\nEVALUATION OF THE  \nCOAGULATION PROCESS\nLABORATORY TESTS\nThere are many tests of the coagulation system that deter-\nmine the susceptibility of the patient to a bleeding episode \nduring or after dental implant surgery.\nProthrombin Time (PT)\nThe PT test is performed routinely for many patients prior \nto surgery or to monitor the effects of the anticoagulant \nwarfarin (Coumadin). Basically, this test of the extrinsic \npathway measures the time it takes for the patient’s plasma \nto form ibrin. Usually, the patient’s warfarin dose will be"

However, con-\ntinuing the anticoagulation medication may increase the risk \nof bleeding episodes for the patient (depending on the pro-\ncedure). The PHYSICIAN should be consulted and periop-\nerative management of anticoagulation should be based on \ntheir recommendations. Unfortunately, most anticoagulation \ninterruption approaches are based on expert opinion. Throm-\nbotic and bleeding risks may vary depending on patient and \nprocedure as data from randomized trials are not available to \ngenerally guide practices. Most physicians will take the fol-\nlowing factors in consideration prior to recommendation:\n• Estimate thromboembolic risk. When a higher thrombo-\nembolic risk exists, the importance of minimizing the \ninterval without anticoagulation is critical. Most patients \nbeing treated for atrial ibrillation, recommendations are \nbased on age and comorbidities. If thromboembolic risk \nis transiently increased (e.g., recent stroke, recent pulmo-\nnary embolism), usually elective surgery is delayed until \nthe risk returns to baseline. The most common issues that \nincrease thromboembolic risk are atrial ibrillation, pros-\nthetic heart valves, and recent venous or arterial thrombo-\nembolism (e.g., within the preceding three months).\n• Estimate bleeding risk. When the procedure is classiied as a \nhigher bleeding risk, there is a greater need for perioperative \nhemostasis measures and a longer period of anticoagulant \ninterruption. The risk of bleeding is usually determined by \nthe type of surgery and invasiveness of the procedure. Patient \ncomorbidities (e.g., older age, decreased renal function) and \ncurrent medications that affect hemostasis should also be \ntaken into consideration. Usually with dental implant surgery, \nbleeding risk is most likely to be classiied as “low risk.”\n• Determine the timing of anticoagulant interruption. \nThe timing of anticoagulant interruption depends on the \nspeciic anticoagulant the patient is receiving. For example, \nwarfarin and aspirin usually requires earlier discontinua-\ntion than the shorter-acting direct oral anticoagulants \n(e.g., dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban).\nTECHNIQUES TO DECREASE  \nAND CONTROL BLEEDING\nThe need to control gross bleeding is paramount for success-\nful surgery because insidious and continuous loss of blood \nfrom arteries, veins, or capillaries can become signiicant if \nbleeding is not controlled. Dental implant clinicians have \nnumerous options for maintaining hemostasis, which include \nmechanical, thermal, pharmacologic, and topical agents.\nMECHANICAL METHODS\nThe most common primary mechanical method to control \nbleeding is to apply direct pressure or compression on the \naltered depending on PT times. The prothrombin time ref-\nerence range will depend on the analytical method used; \nhowever, it is usually 12-13 seconds. The results should \nalways be interpreted using the reference range from the \nlaboratory.\nInternational Normalized Ratio (INR)\nBecause of the poor standardization of the prothrombin \ntime, a wide variation in values obtained by laboratories \nresulted in inconsistent test values. It has become a standard \nin most laboratories to perform a correction of the pro-\nthrombin time, or to “normalize” the result. This normalized \ntest is called the INR (international normalized ratio), and it \nis much more accurate in the assessment of a patient’s bleed-\ning time. A normal INR is 1.0 %. However, in anticoagulated \npatients, the INR will be higher, usually within the therapeu-\ntic range of 2.0% to 3.5%. The target anticoagulation level \ndiffers for each patient because the anticoagulation will \nrequire different therapeutic INR levels. Prolonged INR and \nPT values are indicative of liver disease, warfarin treatment, \nor vitamin K deiciency.\nPartial Thromboplastin Time (PTT)\nThe PTT test is usually performed for many patients prior to \nsurgery and to monitor the effect of anticoagulation using \nheparin. The test measures the intrinsic pathway and factors \nV, VIII, IX, X, and XI. The formation of the blood clot requires \nthe participation of a series of proteins, and deiciency of \nany of these will result in abnormal values. The test is \nexpressed in seconds compared to the number of seconds it \ntakes a control normal plasma sample to clot. The most \ncommon causes of an abnormal PTT are a hereditary dei-\nciency of Factor XI and von Willebrand disease. Ideally, the \nPTT value should be approximately 1.5 to 2.5 times the mean \nnormal value.\nBleeding Time\nThe bleeding time test is a rather old method of determining \nplatelet function. The Ivy method is the most common tech-\nnique, which involves a supericial (less than 1 mm deep), \nsmall (1 cm long) cut made on the skin of the forearm using \na special instrument. The time it takes for the cut to stop \nbleeding is a test of the function of the platelets. The normal \nvalue is usually less than 9 12 minutes. A prolonged bleeding \ntime is a result of decreased number of thrombocytes or \nimpaired blood vessels.\nPlatelet Count\nA platelet count is a test that calculates the number of plate-\nlets. Normally, the platelet count should be 100,000–400,000 \ncells/mm3. Counts less than 100,000 mm3 (thrombocytope-\nnia) can be associated with signiicant intra- and postopera-\ntive bleeding.\nThe platelet is synthesized by the bone marrow and broken \ndown by the spleen. Abnormalities that would cause a \ndecreased number of platelets are either inherited or acquired, \nwith acquired being rather rare."

    "content": "273\nCHAPTER 7 Intraoperative Complications: Bleeding\nDirect Pressure\nIf signiicant intraoperative bleeding occurs, the ideal treat-\nment should involve immediate application of pressure to the \nsurgical site. Pressure or compression directly on the blood \nvessel will allow for platelet aggregation and initiation of the \ncoagulation cascade. Pressure may be applied manually or by \nthe patient biting forcefully on a gauze dressing. Pressure \nshould be maintained for at least 3 to 5 minutes to allow the \nformation of a blood clot. Caution should be exercised to not \nremove the gauze too early because this may dislodge the clot. \nIdeally, 3 × 3 or 4 × 4 gauze should be utilized because 2 × 2 \ngauze may be accidentally aspirated. In primary bleeding, \npressure is the simplest and fastest method to control bleed-\ning prior to the use of hemostatic measures.\nSuturing\nSuturing plays a signiicant role not only in obtaining primary \nclosure for ideal healing but also for maintaining hemostasis \n(direct vs. indirect). Direct placement of a suture (ligation) is \nused when there is access to a deep bleeding vessel. The suture \nis placed by entering the tissue at least 4 mm from the bleed-\ning vessel, 3 mm below the vessel, and 4 mm exiting the \ntissue. This will ligate or occlude the vessel as long as it is \nplaced proximal to the bleeding area. A igure-eight suture \ntechnique is ideally utilized (Fig. 7.5A).\nIndirect suture placement is utilized to retract the tissue \nand minimize bleeding via pressure from the accumulated \ntissue. This is most often used as tie-backs when relecting an \nedentulous mandible (cuspid to molar bilaterally). And lastly, \ngood suturing technique is paramount for preventing reac-\ntionary bleeding after surgery. Ideally, interrupted or mattress \nsutures should be placed in conjunction with continuous \nsutures to maintain closure. A suture material that exhibits \nhigh tensile strength is recommended, such as polyglycolic \nacid (e.g., Vicryl) (Fig. 7.5B–C). The interim prosthesis \nshould be modiied to have no direct pressure on the wound \nsite and this may dislodge the sutures.\nClamped Vessel With Hemostat Forceps\nWhen local measures are not successful in controlling bleed-\ning, a hemostat may be utilized to clamp the blood vessel. \nUsually a curved Kelly hemostat may be used to clamp the \nvessel to control the bleeding via two mechanisms:\n1. Occluding the vessel and damaging the blood vessels \nwall to stimulate clotting. This clamping pressure \nshould be maintained for approximately 2–3 minutes, \nwhich will usually allow for hemostasis. However, this \nmethod may be unreliable because the clot may become \ndislodged and postoperative bleeding may occur after \nremoval of the hemostat.\n2. A more successful technique in controlling bleeding is \nto use ine-pointed hemostats (Kelly hemostats) and \nligate the bleeding vessel with suture material. The \nvessel should be clamped to obtain immediate hemo-\nstasis with the tip of the hemostat extending beyond \nthe vessel. A clamped vessel may be ligated with suture \nbleeding site along with repositioning the patient. Secondary \nmechanical methods include suturing, clamping the blood \nvessel with hemostats, and ligating the bleeding vessel with \nsuture material.\nPositional Changes\nWhen signiicant bleeding occurs, maintaining the patient in \na supine position is not recommended because of increased \nbleeding (head below the heart). Hydrostatic pressure occurs \nwithin the vascular system because of the weight of the blood \nvessels and is dependent on gravity. The pressure is decreased \nin any vessel above the heart and increased in blood vessels \nbelow the heart. Studies have shown that in an upright posi-\ntion, the average pressure at the level of the heart is 100 mm \nHg. Vessels in the head and neck averaged 49 mm Hg and \n186 mm Hg at the foot level.14 Repositioning the patient to \nan upright position (head above the heart) will not stop the \nbleeding; however, it will signiicantly decrease the hemor-\nrhage (studies have shown a decrease up to 38%) (Fig. 7.4).15\nFIG 7.4 Repositioning a patient to decrease bleeding.

Use the lowest possible setting to achieve the desired \neffect.\n2. Use the CUT mode, not the COAG mode. COAG has a \nhigher peak-to-peak voltage and is more prone to alter-\nnate (small) current pathways.\n3. After clamping the vessel, touch the active electrode to \nthe hemostat closer to the patient (below the hand \nholding the hemostat) and then activate the electrode. \nThis minimizes sparking and the subsequent demodu-\nlation of current while encouraging a path of least \nresistance.\nNote: Care should be exercised because the implant \nclinician may receive burns or be shocked even when \nwearing protective gloves. When the surgeon clamps a \nbleeding vessel and the electrode is touched to the \nhemostat, the tissue between the clamped hemostat is \ncoagulated. The “buzzing” may cause high-voltage \nbreakdown of the surgeon’s glove, leading to a burn. To \nminimize this possibility the surgeon’s glove should be \nchanged if wet because hydrated gloves show a lower \nresistance. Additionally, the electrode should be placed \nin contact with the hemostat prior to activation of the \nelectrosurgical current to minimize the production of \na spark (Fig. 7.8).\nLasers\nLasers, which are gaining popularity as a tool in dental \nsurgery, may also be used to achieve hemostasis. Laser is an \nacronym for “light ampliication by stimulated emission of \nradiation,” which produces laser light energy. Laser energy \ndelivered to an area of bleeding may be relected, scattered, \ntransmitted, or absorbed. The extent of the tissue reaction \ndepends on the laser wavelength, power settings, spot size, \nand length of contact time with the bleeding area. Lasers have \nbeen shown to be a safe or useful modality in treating dental \nsurgery patients with bleeding disorders.16\nPHARMACOLOGIC TECHNIQUES\nAlthough pharmacologic techniques may be utilized in \nimplant dentistry to control bleeding, the success of main-\ntaining hemostasis is questionable, with varying results.\nEpinephrine\nEpinephrine may be used to enhance hemostasis in combi-\nnation with local anesthesia (e.g., 2% Lidocaine 1100 000\n,\n epi \nor 150 000\n,\n epi). When locally placed, epinephrine will reduce \nbleeding, slow the absorption of the local anesthetic, \nand prolong the anesthetic and analgesic effect. The hemo-\nstatic properties are related to platelet aggregation, which \nleads to a decrease in the adenoreceptors within the vessel \nwalls, thus producing vasoconstriction. However, rebound \nhyperemia may result postoperatively, which will increase \nbleeding. Various studies have shown that topical applica-\ntion of 1/100,000 concentration of epinephrine creates \nvaporizing tissues. Electrocautery is most effective on small \nvessels and may be utilized in two modes: monopolar and \nbipolar (Fig. 7.7).\nMonopolar electrosurgery delivers current using different \ntypes of waveforms (i.e., modes). The coagulation mode uti-\nlizes an interrupted waveform, which generates heat, thereby \ncoagulating a cell, a phenomenon also termed fulguration. \nThe cutting mode is low energy, which produces a cutting \neffect to vaporize tissue with minimal hemostasis. The blend \nmode simultaneously cuts tissue and coagulates bleeding. \nThis technique is often dificult to use in implant surgery \nbecause access and a relatively dry ield is needed to cauterize \nthe vessel. A dry ield is needed for the effective electrical \ncurrent to pass through the tissues. A high-speed plastic, not \nmetal, suction tip should be used to maintain a dry ield.\nBuzzing the Hemostat: (Electrocautery + \nHemostat Ligation)\nUsually on larger vessels, the combination of a clamped vessel \n(with curved hemostat) and electrocautery will allow for the \nFIG 7.7 Electrocautery.

It may be used as a \npowder or combined with a gelatin sponge during surgical \nprocedures.\nThrombin bypasses the initial enzymatic process, thereby \nexerting its effect by impairing aspects of the coagulation \ncascade.

Thrombin-JMI) is available as a \npowder that may be used dry, reconstituted with sterile saline, \nor added to gelatin sponges or collagen. Antibody formation \nhas been associated with bovine thrombin, and this may lead \nto coagulopathies. 23\nHuman plasma thrombin (e.g., Evithrom) is available as a \nfrozen liquid that can be reconstituted via an absorbable \ngelatin sponge. Human plasma thrombin has been associated \nwith the potential risk of viral or disease transmission.24\nRecombinant thrombin (e.g., Recothrom) is a genetically \nengineered thrombin available in a powder form. It may be \napplied via a spray kit or with an absorbable gelatin sponge. \nThe use of recombinant thrombin eliminates the risk of anti-\nbody formation and disease and virus transmission.25\nAdvantages. Thrombin use is advantageous in patients \nreceiving antiplatelet or anticoagulation medications. Throm-\nbin does not need to be removed from the bleeding site \nbecause degeneration and reabsorption of the ibrin clot is \nachieved during the normal healing process. Usually, \nthrombin-containing active agents have a rapid onset of \naction, providing hemostasis within 10 minutes in most \npatients.22\nDisadvantages. Thrombin is ineffective in patients who \nsuffer from aibrinogenemia because ibrinogen will not be \npresent in the patient’s blood. Care should be exercised to not \nuse thrombin directly on larger vessels because systemic \nabsorption may lead to intravascular thrombosis.\nPASSIVE HEMOSTATIC AGENTS\nPassive hemostatic agents provide hemostasis by accelerating \nthe coagulation process. These agents form a physical, lattice-\nlike matrix, which activates the extrinsic clotting pathway and \nprovides a platform for platelets to aggregate and form a clot. \nPassive hemostatic agents are effective only on patients who \nhave an ideal coagulation process. If the patient suffers from \na any type of coagulopathy, other hemostatic techniques \nshould be utilized.\nThese types of agents are available in many different forms \n(e.g., bovine collagen, cellulose, gelatins) and application \nmethods (e.g., absorbable sponge, foam, pads that may absorb \nseveral times their own weight). Expansion may lead to \nibrinogen is needed because it is necessary for the formula-\ntion of a clot. Therefore, when a patient exhibits the absence \nof ibrinogen, thrombin will not be effective. Fibrinogen is \nless susceptible to coagulopathies caused by clotting factor \ndeiciencies and platelet dysfunction.21 However, thrombin \ndoes work in the presence of antiplatelet and anticoagulation \nmedications, which are quite prevalent in the population \n(Fig. 7.11).\nTypes of Thrombin.

Therefore after hemostasis is \nobtained, passive hemostats should be removed to minimize \npostoperative complications. Passive hemostatic agents are \nreadily available and inexpensive.\nCollagen\nCollagen-based hemostatic agents work by contact activation \nand promotion of platelet aggregation, which occurs as a \nresult of contact between blood and collagen. Collagen is \navailable in many carrier forms such as a powder, paste, or \nsponge. Studies have shown that between 2% to 4% of the \ntotal population are allergic to bovine collagen.26\nBovine Collagen (OraPlug, OraTape [Salvin Dental Spe-\ncialties, Inc.]). Products such as OraPlug and OraTape are \nsoft, white, pliable, nonfriable, coherent, spongelike struc-\ntures that are fabricated from bovine collagen (usually from \ndeep lexor tendons). They are nontoxic, nonpyrogenic, and \nhighly absorbent. Indications include the control of oozing \nor bleeding from clean oral wounds. They help control bleed-\ning, by stabilizing blood clots, and protect the wound bed to \nfacilitate the healing process. When applied, the products \nshould be held in place for approximately 2 to 5 minutes to \nachieve ideal hemostasis and then may be removed, replaced, \nor left in place. Most collagen materials are completely \nresorbed within 14 to 56 days (Fig. 7.12A–B).27\nMicroibrillar Collagen (Avitene Microibrillar Collagen \nHemostat [Davol Inc.]). Microibrillar collagen was irst \nintroduced in the 1970s. This hemostatic agent is fabricated \nby purifying bovine collagen and processing it into micro-\ncrystals. Avitene was irst launched in a lour form, and it is \nstill commonly used in the topical powder form. Collagen-\nbased products activate the intrinsic pathway of the coagula-\ntion cascade.28 Avitene produces a large surface area, which \nacts as a matrix for platelet activation, aggregation, and \nthrombus formation. Advantages include a rapid onset of \nhemostasis, minimal tissue reactivity, low infection rate, and \nability to be reabsorbed.29 In vitro studies have shown micro-\nibrillar collagen to be the most effective in maintaining \nhemostasis, followed by collagen, sponge, and then oxidized \ncellulose (Fig. 7.12C).20 The disadvantage of microcellular \ncollagen products is they are extremely expensive with a short \nshelf life.\nCellulose\nThe most common cellulose-based hemostatic agent is regen-\nerated oxidized cellulose that initiates clotting via contact acti-\nvation. Oxidized cellulose has been shown to be poorly absorbed \nand may cause healing complications postoperatively.\nResorbable Oxidized Cellulose/Fabric Meshwork (Surgi-\ncel [Ethicon US]). Surgicel is a resorbable oxidized cellulose \nmaterial in a sterile fabric meshwork. When Surgicel is applied \nto the bleeding area, it swells into a brownish/black gelatinous \nmass that aids in the clotting process. Because this agent \nFIG 7.12 Collagen hemostatic agents.

This caustic material \nshould ideally be removed because it may delay healing and \ninterfere with osteogenesis (Fig. 7.13A).\nCellulose Fabric Meshwork (ActCel [Coreva Health \nScience, LLC]). ActCel is a cellulose fabric meshwork similar \nto Surgicel. When the meshwork comes into contact with \nblood, it expands to 3 to 4 times its original size and is almost \nimmediately converted to a gel. It will undergo complete dis-\nsolution within 1 to 2 weeks.30 This material has the advan-\ntage over Surgicel that it degrades rapidly into biocompatible \nend products (glucose, water) and thus does not adversely \naffect wound healing or bone formation. The mechanisms of \naction will enhance the coagulation process biochemically by \nincreasing platelet aggregation and physically by initiating \nclot stabilization."

Additionally, in arte-\nrial bleeds, passive hemostatic agents may not be completely \neffective. If a signiicant arterial bleed occurs, ligation of the \nartery is usually the ideal treatment. Caution should be noted \non the use of nonabsorbable passive agents, which can poten-\ntiate a foreign-body reaction resulting in chronic inlamma-\ntion, infection, or granuloma formation.\nSUMMARY OF TECHNIQUES TO DECREASE \nAND CONTROL BLEEDING\nIntraoperative bleeding episodes during dental implant \nsurgery are most likely to increase in the future as more medi-\ncally compromised and elderly patients are being treated, \nincluding patients utilizing anticoagulant medications. In \nrare situations, these bleeding episodes may be life threaten-\ning, which necessitates the dental implant surgeon having \nknowledge of fast and effective techniques to achieve hemo-\nstasis. The use of topical agents has been shown to improve \nblood conservation, avoid potential adverse effects, and \ndecrease surgery time. The dental implant clinician must be \nfamiliar with products that help to achieve hemostasis in case \nof complications that may arise.\nPREVENTION/TREATMENT OF BLEEDING\nANATOMIC AREAS\nThe ideal management of intraoperative hemorrhage is preven-\ntion. Though the clinician should be capable of handling poten-\ntial bleeding complications, the best course of action is to avoid \nthem as much as possible, which is aided by taking the appro-\npriate preventive measures. A preoperative assessment of the \npatient is mandatory, including a thorough preoperative patient \nhistory, medical consultation when indicated. The clinician \nshould also be familiar with managing patients on anticoagu-\nlants and those who have bleeding issues, utilize meticulous \nintraoperative surgical technique, and provide appropriate \npostoperative instructions, care, and follow-up. Patients need to \nbe instructed on the importance of compliance with prescribed \nmedication and proper postoperative instructions and care.\nIncision/Relection of Tissue\nThe dental implant clinician must carefully plan the location \nof incisions with respect to surgical anatomy to maintain \nhemostasis and minimize bleeding. Ideally, incisions should \nalways be made over bony support when possible. This will \nallow for pressure to be applied over bone in the event of \nuncontrolled bleeding. The lap design should incorporate \nrelease incisions so that excessive pressure and stretching is \nreduced in order to decrease possible tearing of the tissue. \nElevation of the mucosa and periosteum should be carefully \ncompleted with full-thickness and atraumatic relection. \nSplit-thickness laps should be avoided to minimize potential \nbleeding sites. Anatomic areas containing vital structures, \nthat may be highly vascular, should be carefully evaluated and \navoided if possible (Fig. 7.19).\nFIG 7.19 (A–B) Ideal incision location and full-thickness \nrelection will reduce bleeding with atraumatic relection of \nthe tissue. Incisions should ideally be over bone to minimize \ntrauma to the tissue. \nA\nB\nAnatomy/ Anatomic Variants\nStrategic planning of potential implant sites is mandatory, \nwith a thorough understanding of anatomic structures and \nvariants with the use of a cone beam computed tomography \n(CBCT).

It then transverses deep to the digastric and stylohyoid \nmuscles and courses between the hyoglossus and genioglos-\nsus muscles. There exist four main branches of the lingual \nartery: the suprahyoid, dorsal lingual, deep lingual, and sub-\nlingual. Of clinical signiicance to oral implantology is the \nsublingual artery, which supplies the sublingual salivary \ngland, mylohyoid and surrounding muscles, and the mucous \nmembranes and gingiva of the mandible. A distal branch runs \nmedially in the anterior lingual mandibular gingiva and anas-\ntomoses with the contralateral artery. An additional branch \nconnects with the submental artery under the mylohyoid \nmuscle.40 The lingual artery will anastomose throughout the \ntongue area, with more anastomoses occurring anteriorly.41\nSubmental Artery (Facial Artery)\nThe most important branch of the facial artery associated with \noral implantology is the submental branch, which is the largest \nof the branches of the facial artery. The submental branch exits \nthe submandibular gland and proceeds anteriorly on the \nsurface of the mylohyoid muscle, just inferior to the body of \nthe mandible. The submental branch terminates as an anasto-\nmosis with the sublingual branch of the lingual artery and the \nmylohyoid branch of the inferior alveolar artery.40\nStudies have shown that the loor of the mouth and lingual \ngingiva is supplied approximately 53% by the submental artery \nand the remaining by the sublingual artery.42 Perforation of the \nlingual cortical plate may result in trauma to the submental \nartery. Treatment should include immediate repositioning of \nthe patient in an upright position followed by the application \nof bimanual pressure. This should be immediately applied, \nfollowed by airway management and emergency protocol. \nBleeding from the submental artery may be decreased by \napplying inger pressure over the lower border of the mandible. \nDoppler ultrasonography studies have shown this to reduce the \narterial blood by 25% to 50% at the oral commissure level and \n33% to 50 % at the inferior border of the nares.43\nKatsumi et al described four types of sublingual and sub-\nmental arteries:\nType 1: Sublingual artery, no submental artery (63%)\nType 2: Sublingual and submental present (5.6%)\nType 3: Submental, no sublingual (29.6%)\nType 4: Submental with no deep lingual artery (1.8%)\nIn Types 2, 3, and 4 vessel anatomy are associated with \nsublingual bleeding issues.44 There also exists a relationship \nof the submental and sublingual arteries in dentate vs. eden-\ntulous patients. Usually the sublingual arteries course above \nthe mylohyoid line and the submental arteries run below or \nwithin the muscle.45,46 In dentate patients hemorrhage risk is \nhigh with vessels above the mylohyoid. In edentulous patients \nthe mylohyoid line approaches the alveolar crest, thus lending \nto high risk of hemorrhage, which may result in arterial \ndamage in the submandibular space.\nPrevention. Clinical and radiographic evaluation should be \ncompleted to ascertain the amount of available bone and \nIncisive Artery\nThe incisive artery is the second terminal branch of the infe-\nrior alveolar artery, which is a branch of the maxillary artery. \nThe incisal branch continues anteriorly after supplying in \nthe mandibular irst molar area, where it innervates the \nincisor teeth and anastomoses with the contralateral incisal \nartery. In rare cases, the incisive canal is large, lending to \ngreater bleeding during osteotomy preparation or bone graft-\ning procedures.1\nPrevention. The exact location of the incisive canal is easily \ndetermined via a CBCT evaluation in the panoramic or sagit-\ntal views.\nManagement. Bleeding complications can occur when \nimplants are placed into the mandibular incisive canal, which \ncontains the incisive artery. If bleeding does occur during \nplacement of the implant, a direction indicator or surgical bur \ncan be placed into osteotomy to apply pressure (Fig. 7.22).\nMANDIBULAR ANTERIOR:  \nEXTRAOSSEOUS VESSELS\nThe anterior mandible is usually known as a safe area for \nimplant placement, but in certain situations, it may present \nwith a signiicant undercut on the lingual aspect between the \nforamina. Life-threatening hemorrhage has been reported \nwhen a drill perforates the lingual plate of the sublingual \nregion of the mandible and traumatizes a sublingual or sub-\nmental artery, especially in the canine region.38,39 If perfora-\ntion of the lingual cortical plate is associated with arterial \nbleeding, it is critical to identify its origin and treat aggres-\nsively. The origin of bleeding in the loor of the anterior \nregion of the mouth may be from the lingual artery, facial \nartery, or one of its branches. The submental artery originates \nfrom the facial artery and courses along the inferior border \nof the mandible.

This is most \nimportant in the mandibular canine position. Additionally, \ncare should be exercised in elevation of the lingual lap and \nmanipulation of the lingual tissue.\nClinical Signiicance. Bleeding into the sublingual and \nsubmaxillary spaces will cause elevation of the tongue and \nloor of the mouth. Bleeding in these spaces will proceed to \nairway obstruction because the anterior extension of the \nhematoma is limited by the supericial layers of the cervical \nfascia.47 The signs and symptoms of sublingual swelling \ninclude immediate or delayed (up to 4–8 hours after surgery) \nelevation of the loor of the mouth, protrusion of the tongue, \nprofuse intraoral bleeding, dificulty in swallowing, and \nrespiratory depression. The submandibular swelling may \ndislocate the trachea to the contralateral side and compro-\nmise the airway.48 Additionally, pulsatile hematomas (pseu-\ndoaneurysms) of the lingual artery may result from the injury \n(Fig. 7.23).49\nManagement. Immediate bimanual pressure should be \napplied to the bleeding area if location can be determined. A \n4 × 4 gauze may be used to apply the bimanual compression \ndownward from loor of the mouth (lingual surface of the \nmandible) and in an upward direction from the submental \nskin area. The patient should be repositioned from a supine \nto an upright position. A Young forceps may be used to pull \nthe tongue outward, which will slow the bleeding. Airway \nobstruction should be of vital concern because this may lead \nto a life-threatening situation. If any clinical signs of airway \nobstruction exist (e.g., dyspnea, dysphagia, wheezing, stridor, \ncyanosis), emergency intervention should be summoned \nimmediately. Ligation of the bleeding vessel is the ideal treat-\nment to control the hemorrhage. This may be very dificult \nin an ofice setting due to the location and surgical access of \nthe bleeding vessel. To obtain deinitive control of sublingual \nartery bleeding, surgical intervention with selective ligation \nof the branches along with arterial embolization via interven-\ntional angiography is indicated (Fig. 7.24).50\nMANDIBULAR POSTERIOR:  \nEXTRAOSSEOUS VESSELS\nLingual Undercut\nIn the mandibular posterior area a lingual undercut may be \nproblematic and dificult to manage. In this area, perforation \nof the lingual plate can occur very easily, thereby causing \nbleeding episodes, with an origin that may be dificult to \nlocate. Life-threatening situations may result from sublingual \nbleeding. Violation of this area may cause infection or con-\nstant irritation from the extruded implant in the soft tissue. \nIf the perforation were to occur above the mylohyoid muscle, \ndamage to the lingual nerve could result in a neurosensory \nimpairment."

Incision and relection will usually \nencompass the area of buccal artery location. When perform-\ning surgery in this area, a hemostat should always be available \nfor immediate access in order to clamp the vessel.\nManagement. A curved hemostat should be utilized to \ncontrol the bleeding. It should be left in place for 3–5 minutes. \nIf bleeding persists, a ligature may be placed with Vicryl \nsuture material (see Fig. 7.26).\nFacial Artery\nThe facial artery is a branch of the external carotid, lying \nsuperior to the lingual artery and medial to the ramus of the \nmandible (Fig. 7.27). It courses below the digastric and sty-\nlohyoid muscles and passes through a groove in the sub-\nmandibular gland before it becomes supericial around the \ninferior border of the mandible. There are two main \nbranches of the facial artery: the facial and cervical. The \nfacial branch encompasses ive branches, which supply the \neye, nose, and lips. There are four branches of the cervical \nregion supplying the pharynx, soft palate, auditory tube, and \nsubmandibular gland.\nPrevention. Trauma to the facial should always be avoided \nas the clinician should refrain from excessive retraction in \nthis area.\nManagement. If bleeding from the facial artery exists, pres-\nsure should immediately be applied to the angle of the man-\ndible over the vessel. Usually, medical assistance will need to \nbe summoned.\nMAXILLA: LATERAL WALL/NASAL BLEEDING\nSigniicant bleeding from the lateral-approach sinus eleva-\ntion surgery is rather rare; however, it has the potential \nto be troublesome. Three main arterial vessels should be \nof concern with the lateral-approach sinus augmentation. \nBecause of the intra- and extraosseous anastomoses that \nare formed by the infraorbital and posterior superior alveo-\nlar arteries, intraoperative bleeding complications of the \nlateral wall may occur. In some cases, this bleeding may be \nsigniicant.\nExtraosseous Anastomosis\nThe soft tissue vertical-release incisions of the facial lap in a \nresorbed maxilla may sever the extraosseous anastomoses \nduring lateral wall osteotomy preparation for sinus graft \nsurgery. The extraosseous anastomosis on average is located \n23 mm from the crest of the dentate ridge; however, in the \nresorbed maxilla, it may be within 10 mm of the crest. When \nthis artery is severed, signiicant bleeding has been observed. \nThese vessels originate from the maxillary artery and have no \nbony landmark to compress the vessel. Vertical release inci-\nsions in the soft tissue should be kept to a minimum height \nwith delicate relection of the periosteum. Hemostats are \nusually dificult to place on the facial lap to arrest the bleed-\ning. Signiicant pressure at the posterior border of the maxilla \nand elevation of the head to reduce the blood pressure to the \nvessels usually slows the bleeding. The elevation of the head \nmay reduce nasal mucosal blood low by 38%.15"

A comprehen-\nsive review of the patient’s medications should be completed \nto determine if any drug interactions may exist that would \nincrease bleeding. Agents that interfere with platelet function \nshould be avoided for routine analgesia (e.g., nonsteroidal \nantiinlammatory drugs [NSAIDs], aspirin) unless the beneit \noutweighs the increased risk of bleeding. The routine periop-\nerative use of aspirin should usually be avoided due to an \nincreased risk of bleeding and lack of beneit. However, if \nthese medications are administered for a separate indication \nunder the recommendation of a physician (e.g., recent stroke, \nacute coronary syndromes, implanted coronary stent) they \nshould be continued.\nSUMMARY\nDuring the course of any dental implant surgery, the oppor-\ntunity for a bleeding episode exists. The network of vascular \nstructures coursing through the maxillofacial region is exten-\nsive, and many of these structures lie extremely close to the \nsurgical site, regardless of procedure. Damaging these vessels \nmay cause bleeding episodes that range from very benign to \nlife-threatening events, and the ability to achieve hemostasis \nis of paramount importance. Maintaining hemostasis during \nthe surgical procedure is crucial to preserving the physiologic \nfunctions of the patient, providing the implant clinician with \na clear operating ield, and allowing for successful postopera-\ntive wound healing. Understanding factors that predispose \nthe patient to bleeding issues should be evaluated for each \npatient. The arterial vs. venous bleeding is much different and \nshould be able to be differentiated to determine the origin of \nthe bleeding and treated accordingly. The clinician must be \nable to eliminate potential risks that increase bleeding and to \nutilize various techniques to maintain hemostasis throughout \nthe intra- and postoperative time periods.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Once the bleeding is arrested, the \nsponges are removed, the layered graft materials may be \ninserted, and the procedure completed.\nEpistaxis (active bleeding from the nose) following sinus \ngraft surgery is rather common. This may occur with or \nwithout a membrane perforation. Usually epistaxis is limited \nto the irst 24 hours after surgery, and the patient should \nalways be warned of this potential complication.\nIf bleeding should occur through the nose, there exist \nnumerous techniques to obtain hemostasis. Placing a cotton \nroll, coated with petroleum jelly with dental loss tied to one \nend, within the nares may obtund nose bleeding after the \nsurgery. After 5 minutes the dental loss is gently pulled and \nthe cotton roll removed. The head is also elevated, and ice is \napplied to the bridge of the nose. If bleeding cannot be con-\ntrolled, reentry into the graft site and endoscopic ligation by \nan ENT surgeon may be required.\nIf the orbital wall of the sinus is perforated or if an opening \ninto the nares is already present from a previous event (i.e., \nprevious sinus surgery), the sinus curette may enter the nares \nand initiate bleeding. The arteries involved in this site are \ncomposed of branches of the sphenopalatine and descending \npalliative arteries, which are branches of the internal maxil-\nlary artery. The posterior half of the inferior turbinate has a \nvenous network, the Woodruff plexus, which is highly vascu-\nlar. A cotton roll with silver nitrate or lidocaine with 1 : 50,000 \nepinephrine is also effective in obtaining hemostatis.\nPOSTOPERATIVE BLEEDING CONTROL\nPATIENT EDUCATION\nIt is imperative that patients understand that minor oozing \nmay persist for up to 24 hours after dental implant surgery. \nIf the patient is on anticoagulants, this may persist for up to \n48 hours. The patient should be instructed on the use of pres-\nsure dressings, and special care should be taken to minimize \nany trauma to the surgical site (e.g., eating, pulling on lip to \nsee surgical site). The patient should avoid rinsing the mouth \nvigorously. All postoperative instructions should be reviewed \nwith the patient and given in writing prior to surgery.\nPatients should be instructed to limit their activities for a \nminimum of 24 hours depending on the extent of the surgery. \nThe head should be elevated as much as possible during the \ndaytime hours and the use of two pillows (i.e., elevate head) \nduring sleeping will reduce secondary bleeding episodes.\nPostoperative hemorrhage in the anticoagulated patients \nmay lead to signiicant issues. Studies have shown bleeding \nepisodes in anticoagulant patients will most likely occur \nwithin 6 days of the surgery.53 In patients who have exhibited \nsigniicant bleeding during surgery, hemorrhagic shock, \nalthough rare, should be evaluated. If the patient displays any \nsigns or symptoms of shock (e.g., tachycardia, hypotension, \nlethargy, disorientation, cold/clammy skin), immediate \nmedical assistance should be summoned. Treatment would \ninclude intravenous luid replacement to replenish the intra-\nvascular volume and restore tissue perfusion."

Cillo\n8 \nAmong the numerous potential complications that clinicians \nface during implant or bone grafting surgery, the possibility of \ninfection by microorganisms carries some of the most signii-\ncant ramiications. Infection can lead to a multitude of prob-\nlems, including pain, swelling, loss of bone, possible failure of \nthe implant, and patient morbidity issues. Studies have shown \nthat infection after implant surgery occurs approximately 4% \nto 10% of the time with over 66% of implants failing.1 It is \ncrucial for the implant clinician to prevent, diagnose, and treat \ninfections associated with implant procedures.\nThere is a large contingent of factors that may promote the \noccurrence of infection during the surgical implant process. \nGiven that dental implants and bone graft materials are placed \nin an entirely nonsterile environment, the clinician must pay \nattention to every aspect that may hinder the healing process \nand promote infection at the surgical site. In this regard, \nthe clinician must obtain a detailed history of the patient’s \npast and current medical histories and any medications/\nsupplements. This will allow the clinician to obtain the best \npossible environment to achieve surgical implant success.\nSome of the systemic conditions that clinicians placing \nimplants may encounter, such as diabetes, may contribute to \nan increased chance of infection in the implant and bone \ngraft patient. Uncontrolled diabetes has long been known as \na potential source of infection in dental implant surgery.2 \nAdditionally, two often overlooked medical conditions that \nhave recently been shown to increase the occurrence of infec-\ntion and failure in implant and bone graft surgery are the \nhigh levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and \nlow levels of serum vitamin D. These and other biologic con-\nditions highlight the importance of a comprehensive medical \nhistory to ascertain the risk of infection in the dental implant \npatient (Box 8.1).3\nPatients with one or more of the above diseases need to be \nevaluated as high risk for postoperative infection and delayed \nhealing. A medical clearance from the patient’s physician \nalong with antibiotic prophylaxis is highly recommended.\nRISK OF INFECTION\nEven under ideal conditions a dental implant or bone graft is \nbasically placed into a contaminated ield due to the natural \nlora of the oral environment. The amount of bacteria \nrequired to cause an infection is far less than that required in \na clean surgical wound. For example, when a suture is placed \nthrough the tissue, the amount of bacteria that is needed to \ncause an infection is reduced by a factor of 1000. Thus not \nonly are these procedures complicated by the initial bacterial \nload but also by an inoculation of the implant or bone graft \narea by oral bacteria.4\nTo evaluate the risk for postoperative wound infection, a \nclassiication of operative wounds and risk of infection was \ndeveloped by the American College of Surgeons Committee \non Control of Surgical Wound Infections. All surgical proce-\ndures were classiied according to four levels of contamina-\ntion and infection rates. Within these classiications, it is \ngenerally accepted that all class 2, class 3, and class 4 proce-\ndures warrant the use of prophylactic antibiotics (Box 8.2).5\nBy deinition, elective dental implant surgery falls within \nthe class 2 (clean-contaminated) category. Class 2 medical \nand dental surgical procedures have been shown to have an \ninfection rate of 10% to 15%. However, with proper surgical \ntechnique and prophylactic antibiotics, the incidence of \ninfection may be reduced to less than 1%. In a healthy \npatient, risk of infection after dental implant surgery is \ninluenced by numerous factors such as type and location of \nsurgery, skill of the surgeon, methods of intraoperative man-\nagement, patient factors, and aseptic technique.6,7 Moreover, \nadditional patient-related (systemic and local) risk factors \nthat are not addressed in these classiications and mentioned \nabove have also been correlated with increased susceptibility \nto infection.\nOne of the most signiicant surgical factors that may con-\ntribute to infection is poor aseptic technique. Various routes \nof transmission of virulent bacteria include (1) direct contact \nwith the patient’s blood or other body luids; (2) indirect \ncontact with contaminated objects; (3) contact of infected \nnasal, sinus, or oral mucosa; and (4) inhalation of airborne \nmicroorganisms. To prevent these conditions a controlled, \nwell-monitored aseptic setting should be achieved for the \nsurgical procedure. The aseptic surgical site includes proper \ndisinfection and draping procedures of the patient, hand \nscrubbing, sterile gowns worn by all surgical members, and \nmaintenance of complete sterility of the instrumentation.\nAnother important surgical factor related to postoperative \ninfection is the duration of the surgical procedure. This factor \nhas been shown to be the second most critical risk factor \n(after wound contamination) affecting postoperative infec-\ntion rates. In general, surgical operations lasting less than \n1 hour have an infection rate of 1.3%, whereas those lasting"

A recent study \nhas shown that less experienced surgeons (<50 implants \nplaced) have 7.3% more failure rates than do experienced \nsurgeons.10 Clinicians early on their learning curve must \nadhere to strict aseptic protocol and good surgical technique \nto reduce the possibility of infections.\nIn the medical literature, it is well documented that the \ninsertion of any prosthetic implant or device increases the \nchance of infection at the surgical site. A dental implant can \nact as a foreign body, and the host’s defenses may be compro-\nmised. The surface of the implant has been shown to facilitate \nbacterial adherence, and the presence of an implant can com-\npromise the host’s defenses. This may result in normal \nlora with low virulence potential causing infections at the \nimplant-host interface, which has been shown to be very dif-\nicult to treat.11\nThe probability of risk for infection for a given procedure \nis related to local, systemic, and surgical factors. The patient’s \nAmerican Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score may be \nused as the systemic baseline and then can be correlated with \nvarious local and surgical factors. A risk index may then be \nmodiied from the literature to correlate these factors to \ndental implant surgeries. The probability of wound infection \nmay then be correlated with the type of wound contamina-\ntion (class 1 to 4) and the risk index. A class 2 wound and a \nrisk index 2 has a greater risk of complications, and a class 1 \nwound and risk index 0 has the least risk of postoperative \ninfection (Table 8.1).12\nDIAGNOSIS OF AN INFECTION\nETIOLOGY OF THE INFECTIOUS PROCESS\nIn order to determine if an infection is present the clinician \nmust evaluate various factors, which include the host, envi-\nronment, and the organism. In health, there exists a balance \nbetween the three. In a diseased state, there is an imbalance \nbetween the three, with the host usually being the most \nimportant factor in determining the outcome of the infec-\ntion. There exists an adversarial relationship between infec-\ntious microbes and the host (Box 8.3).\n3 hours have a rate of more than 4%.8 It is postulated that \nthe rate of infection doubles with every hour of the \nprocedure.9\nThe skill and the experience of the surgeon with the place-\nment of implants have been shown to be signiicant in \n(Adapted from American College of Surgeons Committee on \nControl of Surgical Infections.

    "content": "296\nCHAPTER 8 Intraoperative Complications: Infection\nIn most hosts, these humoral and cellular defenses are \nsuficient to prevent dissemination of the pathogens and \nallow for normal healing, free of infections. However, in some \ninstances, the presence of foreign bodies (implants, bone \ngrafts) and a breakdown in local defenses will result in an \ninfectious process.13,14\nHost Response to Infection\nWhen the infectious pathogens overcome the host defenses \nand result in an infection, the host will trigger a series of \nreactions in response to the infectious insult. The irst initial \nreaction is the inlammatory reaction, which consists of a \nrelease of mediators, vascular changes (vasodilation or hyper-\nemia and increased vascular permeability), and mobilization \nand activation of leukocytes. This is the body’s physiologic \nresponse to the antigenic stimulation to rid itself of the infec-\ntious stimulus, which is localized to the site of the infectious \npathogen. Normally, the initial inlammatory response to \ninfection is rapid, usually within minutes of the pathologic \nstimulus.\nThe inlammatory response is designed to eliminate the \ninfectious pathogens and allow for tissue healing. In a healthy \nindividual, there are six phases of the inlammatory response:\n1. hyperemia, which is caused by vasodilation of the arte-\nrioles and capillaries, and increased permeability of \nvenules with the slowing of the venous blood low;\n2. exudate that is rich in plasma proteins, antibodies, \nnutrients, and leukocytes enters into the surrounding \ntissue;\n3. leukotaxin, a permeability factor, is released, which is \nessential for the migration of polymorphonuclear leu-\nkocytes toward the infected area;\n4. ibrin synthesis from the exudate, which walls off the \narea of infection;\n5. phagocytosis of the bacterial and dead cells;\n6. macrophages dispose of the necrotic debris.\nIn addition to the inlammatory reaction they cause, \npathogens may attack the host by direct injury to the host \ncells, enhancement of the pathogen’s invasiveness, and neu-\ntralization of the host defenses. Systemic effects may result \nsuch as fever, shock, hypersensitivity reactions, and auto-\nimmune responses and may be life threatening.4\nImpaired Host Defenses\nAs stated previously, the host defenses are the most important \naspect in the resolution of the infection. With the inlamma-\ntory response a migration of the white blood cells and the \nproduction of antibodies results, which may resolve the infec-\ntion allowing for normal tissue healing. However, if the host \ndefenses are impaired in any way, the host will not be able to \novercome the infectious process. Peterson has shown that \ndepressed defenses are divided into four categories: physio-\nlogic, disease-related, impaired immune system, and drug \nsuppression–related.4\nPhysiologic. The patient has the inability to deliver white \nblood cells, antibodies, and complements to act against the \nThe pathologic potential of microbes depends on three \nfactors4:\n1. Virulence: the degree of pathogenicity of a microor-\nganism, which includes the pathogen’s genetic, bio-\nchemical, and structural features.\n2. Pathogenicity: the potential or capacity of a pathogen \nto cause disease.\n3. Infectivity: the ability or level at which a pathogen may \ninfect the host and cause an infection.\nIn normal conditions the host factors will predominate, \nand a greater number of host factors present will increase the \nability to ight infection. If the microbial load increases, an \nimbalance occurs until the microbial factors predominate, \nwhich results in infection. During a dental implant proce-\ndure, usually there is a breakdown in the local natural barrier, \nwhich may lead to microbes obtaining an advantage over the \nhost defenses. This will result in the host mobilizing humoral \nand cellular factors.\nHumoral immunity is mediated by macromolecules, which \nare found in extracellular luids such as antibodies, proteins, \nand antimicrobial peptides. Humoral immunity substances \nare found mainly in bodily luids. Antibodies or immuno-\nglobulins are glycoproteins that are found in the blood and \ntissue luids. An antibody identiies and neutralizes the bac-\nteria by binding to the antigens and causing agglutination, \nwhich allows for phagocytosis to break down the bacteria.\nCellular immunity is the body’s immune response that \ndoes not involve antibodies, but utilizes phagocytes, T lym-\nphocytes, and cytokines in response to an antigen. Cellular \nimmunity protects the body from infection via three \nmechanisms:\n1. activating T lymphocytes that are antigen speciic to \ninduce apoptosis within the body’s cells;\n2. activate macrophages that destroy pathogens and \ndebris;\n3. stimulate cells to secrete a variety of cytokines that \ninluence the functional aspects of cells in adaptive \nimmune responses.\n(From Misch CE: Contemporary implant dentistry, ed 3, St. Louis, \n2008, Mosby.)\nBOX 8.3 Microorganisms Most \nCommonly Associated With Periimplant \nComplications\nStaphylococcus spp\nActinomyces spp\nSurface translocating bacteria\nWolinella spp\nCapnocytophaga spp\nFusobacterium spp\nEntamoeba gingivalis\nMotile rods\nFusiforms\nSpirochetes\nEnteric gram-negative bacteria\nCandida albicans"

There are numerous drug-related groups that \nmay affect the defense systems.\nCytoxic drug group. These drugs (e.g., alkylatine, antime-\ntabolite drugs) exert their cytotoxic effect on the DNA or \nRNA, which results in protein synthesis and cell division. The \nend result will be the impaired proliferation of ibroblasts and \ncollagen formation, which predisposes implant patients to \npoor wound healing and increased infection rate.\nGlucocorticosteroids. The use of glucocorticoids (e.g., \nprednisone, dexamethasone) suppresses the inlammatory \nresponse, which may result in wound healing complications \nand possible infection. The exogenous corticosteroids decrease \ncollagen formation, vascularity, and ibroplasia. The ibroblasts \nare decreased by approximately 30%, thus delaying epitheliali-\nzation and wound contraction.15\nAntibodies (e.g., mono- and polyclonal).

These \nare sometimes referred to in the Latin as calor, dolor, rubor, \nand tumor, respectively. Heat (calor) is the result of the inlow \nof blood and an increased local metabolic rate in attempts by \nthe body to both ight and localize the infection.

Edema \n(tumor) is this associated swelling as well as the inlux of \nblood and luid exudate into the local area. Redness (rubor) \nis the result of vasodilation close to the mucosa/skin surface \nBOX 8.4 Common Terms Related to Postoperative Infection\nAbscess: most commonly has distinct and well-deined \nborders, usually very soft and doughy. Will be luctuant to \npalpation because of luid involvement. The presence of \npus will most likely indicate the body has walled off the \ninfection and the body’s host defenses are controlling the \ninfection.\nCellulitis: is typically larger and more widespread than an \nabscess or edema. Its borders are more diffuse; thus the \nclinician cannot determine borders. Is usually indurated or \nhard to palpation and contains no pus. The severity of the \ninfection is proportional to the irmness.\nChronic skin istula: is a sign of retained focus of infection \nand, in some cases, a more serious condition of bone and \nbone marrow inlammation called osteomyelitis. This is most \nlikely observed in the mandible and is associated with infec-\ntion of both endosteal and subperiosteal implants in patients \nwho have poor dental hygiene awareness and lack of implant \nmaintenance.\nEdema: is characteristic of the inoculation stage and is the \neasiest stage to treat.

The \nsigns and symptoms include fever, increased heart rate, \nincreased respiration, and confusion. Sepsis is usually \ncaused by an immune response triggered by a bacterial \ninfection and is treated with intravenous antibiotics and \nluids.

Vascular System: The vascular system of the head and neck \nallows for the spread of infection because pathogens may \ntravel via the venous system, which drains into other \ntissues or organs (Fig. 8.3).\n2. Thrombophlebitis: Infection may spread to the walls of the \nveins, which may also thrombose and create a condition \nreferred to as thrombophlebitis. A lack of valves in the \nhead and neck’s venous system allows retrograde low \nof blood and may involve the cavernous sinus, pterygoid, \nand pharyngeal plexuses with infected thrombi.\n3. Lymph Vessels: The lymph vessels are very prevalent in the \nhead and neck (Fig. 8.4). They commonly drain the \ninfected site and carry the infection to regional lymph \nnodes. The nodes become tender, enlarged, soft, and \nmobile on palpation. This is termed lymphadenitis.\n4. Fascial Spaces: Once the infection is outside the bone, the \nloose areolar connective tissue produces a path of least \nresistance into the various surgical spaces of the head and \nneck, including the thoracic mediastinum (Fig. 8.5). The \nresult of the body’s defensive reaction to foreign materials or \norganisms (Fig. 8.2). The abscess will form once the cellulitis \nstage begins to consolidate through the body’s immune \nsystem response through the use of appropriate antibiotics. \nOnce an abscess is formed, the purulence that produced it \nwill migrate by the path of least resistance. This may be either \nthrough the mucosa or skin or through the fascial pathways \nof the head and neck. An abscess that migrates through the \ndeeper layers of the head and neck, through the lingual man-\ndibular plate to the sublingual space for example, may block \nrespiration (as in Ludwig’s angina) or enter the brain (as in \ncavernous sinus thrombosis or meningitis). This may be life \nthreatening and require immediate surgical and medical \nattention. When an abscess spontaneously drains to an area \noutside the body, an orocutaneous istula for example, it will \ncontinue until the source of the infection is treated.\nDetermination of infection stage. One of the primary \nways to distinguish among the various stages of infection is to \npalpate the area in question.

The temporal fascia surrounds the tem-\nporalis muscle in a strong ibrous sheet that is divided into \nclearly distinguishable supericial and deep layers that origi-\nnate from the same region with the muscle ibers of the two \nlayers intermingled in the superior part of the muscle. Infec-\ntions of odontogenic or implant treatment origin are rare in \nthis space but may occur. If an abscess does develop in this \nspace, intraoral incision and drainage is dificult and usually \nrequires an extra oral approach. Communicating facial-\nzygomaticotemporal nerve branches piercing through the \nfascial and muscular planes of the temporal fascia in the \nsuperior part of the muscle are important landmarks to \nprevent temporal hollowing that may occur due to surgical \naccess procedures.21\nSublingual Space. The sublingual space is bounded between \nthe mylohyoid muscle and the geniohyoid and genioglossus \nmuscles. This space contains the lingual artery and nerve, the \nhypoglossal nerve, the glossopharyngeal nerve, Wharton’s \nduct, and the sublingual salivary gland, which drains into the \noral cavity through several small excretory ducts in the loor \nof the mouth and a major duct known as Bartholin’s duct. \nInfectious spread to this space is through perforation of the \nlingual mandibular cortical plate (Fig. 8.7). Incision and \ndrainage of abscesses in this area are generally adequately \ntreated through a simple intraoral approach.\nSubmental Space. The submental space is bounded anteri-\norly by the symphysis of the mandible, laterally by the ante-\nrior bellies of digastric muscles, superiorly by the mylohyoid \nmuscle, and inferiorly by the supericial fascia of the platysma \nmuscle. There are no vital structures that traverse the sub-\nmental space.

Surgical access to the buccal \nspace infections may be easily accomplished through the \nintraoral approach. More complicated infections, directed by \nlocation within the buccal space, may require a preauricular \nand/or submandibular approach.\nMasticatory Spaces\nMasseteric space (and submasseteric space). The fascia \nthat forms the borders of the masticator space is a well-\ndeined ibrous tissue that surrounds the muscles of mastica-\ntion and contains the internal maxillary artery and the \ninferior alveolar nerve. It is bounded anteriorly by the man-\ndible, posteriorly by the parotid, medially by the lateral pha-\nryngeal space, and superiorly by the temporal space. Infections \nin this space may be misdiagnosed as a parotid abscess or \nparotitis.18\nThe most pronounced clinical feature of infection in this \nspace is trismus. Computed tomography (CT) scan or mag-\nnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be an invaluable resource \nto distinguish abscess from cellulitis and the surgical course \nrequired for treatment.19\nIntraoral surgical access to this space for simple, isolated \nabscesses is generally adequate to allow for drainage but with \nextension into adjacent spaces, an external approach may be \nrequired.\nPterygoidmandibular space. The pterygoidmandibular \nspace is bounded by the mandible laterally and by the medial \npterygoid muscle medially and inferiorly.

The bone \ninfection becomes active in the calciied portion of the bone \nand will produce pus in the medullary cavity and beneath the \nperiosteum, which compromises the blood supply. This initi-\nates ischemia of the bone, which results in necrosis. Osteo-\nmyelitis of the jaws has two main classiications, acute and \nchronic, based on the duration of the disease. Chronic osteo-\nmyelitis has classically been deined as a condition that has \nlasted over 1 month.23 While there are many subclassiications, \nacute and chronic osteomyelitis are generally subclassiied as \nsuppurative or nonsuppurative and usually is different in the \netiology, microbiology, pathogenesis, and treatment in com-\nparison to long bone osteomyelitis.24\ndrainage of infection is generally through an extraoral inci-\nsion below the chin (Fig. 8.8).\nSubmandibular Space.

Shortly thereafter \nthe manufacturers of intravenous bisphosphonates pamidro-\nnate (Aredia) and zoledronic acid (Zometa) notiied health \ncare professionals concerning the risk of developing osteone-\ncrosis of the jaws in patients using these medications.34\nMost recently, the American Association of Oral and \nMaxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS) recommended changing \nthe terminology of this condition. Previously termed \nbisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ), the \ncondition is now referred to as medication-related osteonecro-\nsis of the jaws (MRONJ). This was related to the fact there is \na growing number of osteonecrosis cases involving the maxilla \nand mandible associated with other intravenous antiresorp-\ntive, antiangiogenic, and monoclonal antibody medications, \nas well as exposure to ionizing radiation. A T1-weighted short \ninversion time recovery (STIR) MRI has been shown to be \nable to detect bony changes indicating osteomyelitis as early \nas the subacute phase.29\nHistologically, suppurative osteomyelitis is characterized \nby intense microorganism-provoked marrow inlammation \nand marrow vessel thrombosis with retention of viable \nosteoclasts and periosteum, which creates an environment \nconducive to continual bacterial proliferation.30 In the past, \nStaphylococcus aureus was thought to be the main causative \norganism of osteomyelitis. However, given the unique envi-\nronment of the oral cavity, there tends to be a mixed infection \nwith hemolytic streptococci and a predominance of oral \nanaerobes (e.g., Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium, and Bacte-\nroides). Additionally, various other organisms, such as Acti-\nnomyces spp and Treponema pallidum, cause other types of \nosteomyelitis.31\nTreatment of osteomyelitis usually involves removal of the \nsuspected source, antibiotic therapy, medical treatment, and \nsurgical intervention. Topazian has established the principles \nof treatment for osteomyelitis to include: (1) evaluation and \ncorrection of host defense deiciencies; (2) Gram staining, \nculture, and sensitivity; (3) radiographic imaging; (4) admin-\nistration of stain-guided empirical antibiotics; (5) removal of \nmobile teeth/implants and sequestra; (6) administration of \nstain-guided antibiotics; (7) possible placement of irrigating \nFIG 8.11 Osteomyelitis.

Current or previous treatment with antire-\nsorptive or antiangiogenic agents:\n• Exposed bone or bone that can be probed through an \nintraoral or extraoral istula(e) in the maxillofacial \nregion that has persisted for more than 8 weeks; and\n• No history of radiation therapy to the jaws or obvious \nmetastatic disease to the jaws.\nAlthough the true pathophysiology of MRONJ is not \nyet fully understood, decreased bone turnover (altered \nbone remodeling or over suppression of bone resorption) \nand infection are thought to be central to the pathogenesis \nof MRONJ.36\nHistologically, MRONJ is characterized by marrow spaces \nwith empty Howship lacunae and an absence of osteoclasts \nand viable periosteum. This suggests a noninlammatory \ndrug toxicity to bone by osteoclastic death leading to over-\nsuppression of bone renewal. Many additional hypotheses \nhave been proposed such as angiogenesis inhibition, constant \nmicrotrauma, suppression of innate or acquired immunity, \nvitamin D deiciency, soft tissue toxicity to bisphosphonates, \nand inlammation (Fig. 8.14).37-40\nBisphosphonates prevent the renewal of old and injured \nbone because they make it brittle and prone to fracture, \nhave a half-life in bone of 11 years due to irreversible binding \nto bone, and (when administered intravenously) accumulate \nin bone 142.8 times faster than oral bisphosphates.41 Addi-\ntionally, osteoclastic resorption of bisphosphonate-loaded \nbone results in osteoclast death in which the cell bursts \nand releases retained bisphosphonate molecules inside the \ncell that redistribute in the local bone or bone marrow in a \nredosing effect.\nRecently, the presence of bioilm has emerged to explain the \netiology of many chronic infections, and this may be a contrib-\nuting factor in the development and proliferation of MRONJ. \nBioilm is an aggregation of bacterial colonies and other micro-\norganisms such as yeast, fungi, and protozoa that have estab-\nlished a microenvironment from the secretion a mucilaginous \nprotective coating in which they are encased that may be \nextremely dificult to treat with medications alone.\nSedghizadeh et al looked at bioilm composition on speci-\nmens from individuals who had sequestrectomy of bone for \nMRONJ.42 They found that bone specimens from affected \nsites in all patients revealed large areas occluded with bioilms \ncomprising mainly bacteria and occasionally yeast (Candida \nspp). The specimens included a large number of bacterial \nmorphotypes and included species from the genus Fusobac-\nterium, Bacillus, Actinomyces, Staphylococcus, and Streptococ-\ncus. Bacterial colonization of the denuded bone in MRONJ \nhas suggested that bisphosphonates may increase bacterial \nadhesion and bioilm formation. Kos et al discovered an \nup to a seven-fold increase in bacterial colonization on \npamidronate-coated hydroxyapatite disc compared to con-\ntrols.43 They postulated that the nitrogen group on pamidro-\nnate may act as a steric factor that facilitates anchoring of \nbacteria to the hydroxyapatite surface or may attract bacteria \nby direct electrostatic interaction. These studies lay credence \nto the high probability that increased bacterial adhesion in \nsuch as Denosumab (Prolia, Xgeva), which is a fully human \nmonoclonal antibody used for the treatment of osteoporosis, \ntreatment-induced bone loss, bone metastases, and giant cell \ntumor of bone.\nAAOMS has recently initiated guidelines on the signs \nand symptoms of MRONJ in comparison with other non-\nhealing issues.35 Treatment guidelines have also been estab-\nlished which relate to various stages of the condition \n(Table 8.3).

The \nextraction of symptomatic teeth within exposed, necrotic bone should be considered because it is unlikely that the extraction will exacerbate \nthe established necrotic process.\nthe presence of bisphosphonates may promote MRONJ and \nosteomyelitis development.\nIndividuals taking oral bisphosphonate therapy for short \ndurations of time, less than 3 years, do not appear to have \nsigniicantly higher rates of implant failure or infection.44 \nHowever, for patients taking long-term oral bisphosphonate \ntherapy (exceeding 3 years) with concomitant prednisone \ntreatment, there may be a signiicant increase in the incidence \nof both implant failure and infection. This phenomenon may \nbe location speciic because implants placed in the posterior \nmandible or maxilla in patients with a history of long-term \noral bisphosphonate have a greatly increased risk of MRONJ \ndevelopment.45 Individuals who have received at least three \nor more doses of any intravenous antiresorptive medication \n(e.g., Reclast) may be considered an absolute contraindica-\ntion to dental implant therapy with an almost guaranteed \ndevelopment of MRONJ.46\nCavernous Sinus Thrombosis\nCavernous sinus thrombosis is a very rare but extremely dan-\ngerous major complication of head and neck infections. \nAlthough the advent of antibiotics has decreased the \nincidence of the condition, a clinician should be able to rec-\nognize its signs and immediately refer the patient to the \nproper specialists.\nThe cavernous sinuses are trabeculated sinuses located at \nthe base of the skull that drain venous blood from valveless \nfacial veins. Infections may be delivered to this location from \nsources of infection in the vicinity of this vein, most likely \nthose located in the midface. Initial symptoms are progres-\nsively severe headache or facial pain, usually unilateral and \nlocalized to retroorbital and frontal regions with high fever. \nEventually, paralysis of the ocular movements in the eye on \nlateral gaze is a classic sign of this condition. This is termed \nophthalmoplegia because it is due to compression of the sixth \ncranial nerve (lateral ocular gaze) from the pressure of puru-\nlence in the conined space of the sinus. Proptosis (anterior \nbulging of the eye) and eyelid edema also develop and may \noccur bilaterally. As the condition progresses, facial sensation \nmay diminish confusion, and seizures, and a decreased level \nof consciousness may develop. Treatment involves removal of \nthe infection source as well as administration for weeks of \nintravenous antibiotics and luids because surgery is consid-\nered dificult and problematic (Fig. 8.15).\nBrain Abscess\nTransmission of oral infection and the development of \nbrain abscess are a rare but extremely dangerous and life-\nthreatening situation.

A closed curved hemostat is \ninserted into the incision and opened in several directions. \nThe hemostat should be removed in the open position and \nnever in the closed position to avoid inadvertent clamping of \npossible vital structures in the area. This is completed to \nbreak open any small loculations or cavities of purulence. The \narea should then be copiously irrigated with sterile saline \nsolution until the luid runs clear, an indication that all gross \nevidence of infection has been removed. After all visible \npurulence has been removed, a small drain may be placed \ninto the opening. The most common drain is a quarter- \ninch Penrose drain, which is a soft rubber tube placed in a \nwound area to prevent the luid or purulence accumulation \n(see Fig. 8.8). Incision and drainage of surgical spaces such \nas the sublingual, submandibular, pterygomandibular, and \nparapharyngeal spaces that require an extraoral approach and \ncareful dissection are commonly done under general anesthe-\nsia in a hospital setting with the appropriate preoperative, \noperative, and postoperative care by a surgical specialist.\nCULTURE AND SENSITIVITY\nIn some cases a culture and sensitivity (C&S) test is admin-\nistered before the drainage of an abscess. This should ideally \nbe completed at the beginning of the procedure (Box 8.5).\nProcedure\nAfter adequate anesthesia, the surgical area is disinfected and \ndried with sterile gauze. With the use of an 18-gauge needle \nor the cotton applicator, a specimen is collected. The needle \nor cotton-tipped applicator is inserted into the abscess or \ncellulitis, and 1–2 mL of pus or tissue luid is aspirated. The \nspecimen should include pus, blood, tissue luid, or necrotic \ntissue. The specimen is placed (inoculated) directly into \naerobic and anaerobic culturettes, which are sterile tubes con-\ntaining a swab and bacterial transport medium (Fig. 8.19). \nCulturettes usually have a short shelf life, so the expiration \ndate should be checked before use. The clinician should \nrequest in writing a Gram stain, aerobic and anaerobic cul-\ntures, and antibiotic sensitivity testing.\n(From Hupp JR, Tucker MR, Ellis E: Contemporary oral and \nmaxillofacial surgery, ed 6, St. Louis, 2014, Mosby.)\nBOX 8.5 Indications for Culture and \nAntibiotic Sensitivity Testing\n• Infection spreading beyond the alveolar process into fascial \nspaces\n• Symptomatic, rapidly progressive infection\n• Nonresponsive infection (after more than 48 hours) with \nthe use of antibiotics\n• Multiple doses of antibiotic therapy\n• Chronic, recurrent infection\n• Patients who have compromised immune system and \ncomorbidities\nAfter the C&S is completed, an incision with a #15 scalpel \nblade is made through the mucosa into the infected cavity. \nThe incision is usually less than 1 cm in length.

These antibiotics have \nsimilar chemical structures, and the mechanism of action is \nthe inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis (bactericidal) via \nthe interruption of the cross linking between peptidoglycan \nmolecules.\nPenicillins\nPenicillin V. Penicillin V is the oral form of penicillin (pen-\nicillin G being the intravenous form) that is one of the more \ncommon antibiotics used in dentistry today. It is bacteri-\ncidal, well absorbed, and will achieve peak serum levels \nwithin 30 minutes of administration with detectable blood \nlevels for 4 hours. Penicillin and all its derivatives produce \nbactericidal effects by inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthe-\nsis. Penicillin V is effective against most Streptococcus species \nand oral anaerobes. The main disadvantages of penicillin are \nfour times per day dosing due its very short half-life and \nsusceptibility to resistant bacteria (β-lactamase–producing \nbacteria).\nAmoxicillin. Amoxicillin, an ampicillin analog, is a penicillin-\nderived, broad spectrum, bactericidal, semisynthetic beta-\nlactam antibiotic, with superior absorption, high bioavailability, \nand very low toxicity. It acts through the inhibition of cell wall \nbiosynthesis during bacterial multiplication that leads to the \nbacterial death and has excellent diffusion in infected tissues \nwhere high tissue concentrations are easily achieved. Schüssl \net al showed that a single dose of oral amoxicillin (2 grams) \nleads to concentrations in teeth that exceed the minimal inhibi-\ntion concentration of some oral bacteria within 1 hour of \nadministration.56 It is effective against gram-negative cocci and \ngram-negative bacilli, having a greater activity than penicillin \nV against streptococci and oral anaerobes.\nAmoxicillin/Clavulanic Acid (Augmentin).

Certain bacteria, \nsuch as Streptococcus aureus, may produce the enzyme beta-\nlactamase, which acts to hydrolyze, or disrupt, the beta-lactam \nring that permits penicillin-derivative antibiotics to function. \nThis may lead to decreased eficacy of the antibiotic and \ndevelopment of antibiotic resistance. Penicillinase is a speciic \ntype of beta-lactamase that has a speciicity for penicillin and \npenicillin-derived antibiotics. To counteract the activity of \nbeta-lactamase destruction, clavulanic acid was added to \namoxicillin to form Augmentin (trade name), which has an \nafinity for penicillinase-producing bacteria. Clavulanic acid \nfunctions as a “suicide molecule” that inactivates the resistant \nbacteria through disruption of penicillinase function, which \nmakes the bacteria more susceptible to the effects of the \naccompanying amoxicillin. An increase in the prevalence of \npenicillinase-producing bacteria (especially in the sinus), has \nmade this antibiotic combination popular in oral implantol-\nogy. This antibiotic is used mainly in cases in which penicil-\nlinase bacteria is suspected (or known by culture) and is very \npractical as a perioperative antibiotic for sinus augmentation \n(Fig. 8.21).\nCephalosporins\nCephalexin/Cefadroxil. The irst-generation cephalexin/\ncefadroxil antibiotics have an antibacterial spectrum similar \nto amoxicillin. However, they have the advantage of not being \nsusceptible to beta-lactamase destruction by S. aureus. They \nare often used in dentistry as an alternative for the penicillin-\nallergic patient, although cross-reactivity between these two \ndrugs may occur. The cross-reactivity rate to irst-generation \ncephalosporins with penicillin-allergic patients has been \nfound to be approximately 1%.57\nCaution must be exercised because Food and Drug Admin-\nistration (FDA) guidelines report a 10% cross-reactivity. The \nmost recent studies have shown only patients who have had type \nI (immunoglobulin E: immediate hypersensitivity reactions) \nshould not be administered a cephalosporin. If the patient \nhas a previous history of a reaction that was not immuno-\nglobulin E–mediated (types II, III, IV, or idiopathic reac-\ntions), a irst-generation cephalosporin may be administered. \nNewer second- and third-generation cephalosporins exhibit \na broader spectrum, less cross-reactivity, and a greater resis-\ntance to beta-lactamase destruction.58"

Patients should be cautioned against drinking \nalcoholic beverages while taking this medication because \ndisuliram-like reactions have been reported. These consist of \nsevere nausea and abdominal cramping caused by the forma-\ntion of a toxic compound resembling formaldehyde. Metro-\nnidazole should not be prescribed for patients taking the oral \nanticoagulant warfarin (Coumadin).\nPREVENTION AND TREATMENT  \nOF INFECTION\nBecause of the risk of morbidity from infections, antimicro-\nbial therapy is an essential component of the surgical proto-\ncol. Although adverse effects are associated with antibiotic \ntherapy, these are usually mild and infrequent. The antimi-\ncrobials most commonly used in implant dentistry are anti-\nbiotics (local and systemic) and antimicrobial rinses (0.12% \nchlorhexidine gluconate).\nThe use and understanding of the various antibiotic regi-\nmens available in implant dentistry are beneicial for the \ninitial success and long-term maintenance of implant therapy. \nAntibiotic therapy utilized in implant dentistry may be clas-\nsiied as either prophylactic (to prevent infection) or thera-\npeutic (to treat infection).\nPROPHYLACTIC ANTIBIOTICS\nA landmark study by Burke deined the scientiic basis for the \nperioperative use of antibiotics to prevent surgical wound \ninfection.59 From this work, Peterson established principles \non the perioperative use of prophylactic antibiotics.60\nIn general surgery (including its subspecialties), the prin-\nciples of antibiotic prophylaxis are well established. Guide-\nlines are speciically related to the procedure, the type of \nantibiotic, and the dosage regimen. The use of prophylactic \nantibiotics in dentistry has also been documented in the pre-\nvention of complications for patients at risk of developing \ninfectious endocarditis and immunocompromised patients. \nIn oral implantology, there is no consensus on the use and \nindications for prophylactic antibiotics. Disadvantages of the \nuse of antibiotics include the development of resistant bacte-\nria, adverse reactions, and possible resultant lax surgical tech-\nnique. As a result, the need for prophylactic antibiotics in \nhealthy patients, type of antibiotic, dosage, and duration of \ncoverage is controversial. On the other hand, postoperative \nsurgical wound infections can have a signiicant impact on \nthe well-being of the patient and the survival of the implant. \nDocumented cases of potential consequences of infection \nrange from increased pain and edema to patient death. \nAccording to Esposito and Hirsch, one of the main causes of \ndental implant failure is bacterial contamination at implant \ninsertion.61\nA local inoculum must be present for a surgical wound \ninfection to occur, to overcome the host’s defenses, and allow \ngrowth of the bacteria. This process has many variables includ-\ning various host, local tissue, systemic, and microbial virulence \nand the lowest risk is with tetracycline, metronidazole, and \nvancomycin. The latter group is often used to treat PMC \nconditions.\nThe patient should be informed that if either diarrhea or \nabdominal cramping occurs during or shortly after antibiotic \ntherapy, the drug should be discontinued and the doctor \nshould be notiied.\nAntidiarrheal medications should be avoided in these \ncases because they hinder the fecal elimination of the patho-\ngen. If it is necessary to continue management of the dental \ninfection, imidazole or vancomycin is most logical (if not the \noriginal cause of the complications). Metronidazole is not \nonly effective against anaerobes contributing to the dental \ninfection but also against C. dificile, the causative agent. If \nthe condition persists after 3 days, the patient should be \nassessed by an internist for luid and electrolyte imbalance.\nTETRACYCLINES\nTetracyclines have been available since the 1950s and have a \nwide spectrum of activity against streptococci, staphylococci, \noral anaerobes, and gram-negative aerobic rods. Because this \nantibiotic has been so extensively used in the past, there is a \nhigh degree of bacterial resistance. Tetracycline is an attrac-\ntive adjunct for the treatment of gingival and periodontal \ndisease with a high bioavailability in the gingival sulcus. For \nthese reasons, tetracyclines are used by some practitioners as \nprimary agents for treating implant disease and infections \naround implant posts. Their eficacy for managing infrabony \ninfections is questionable, considering their inactivity when \nchelated with calcium complexes. The disadvantages of this \nantibiotic include a high incidence of promoting Candida spp \ninfections and the fact that it may be associated with photo-\nsensitivity reactions.\nFLUOROQUINOLONES\nA recent classiication of antibiotics has had a deinite impact \non the treatment of infections in dentistry and medicine. \nFluoroquinolones are bactericidal antibiotics and have a \nbroad antibacterial spectrum, which may be used either orally \nor parenterally. Ciproloxacin was one of the irst-generation \nquinolones and is the prototype for this antibiotic classiica-\ntion. Newer third- and fourth-generation quinolones have \nbeen developed with great activity against resistant bacteria \nand anaerobic bacteria. In implant dentistry, luoroquino-\nlones are used mainly in the prophylactic and therapeutic \ntreatment of sinus augmentation procedures. Care should be \nexercised with the use of Levaquin and Avelox as they have \nbeen associated with tendon damage.\nMETRONIDAZOLE\nMetronidazole is a bactericidal antibiotic that is most often \nused for anaerobic infections. Because metronidazole has no \nactivity against aerobic bacteria, it is seldom used for mixed \ninfections unless it is combined with another antibiotic. It"

To \naccomplish this goal, the antibiotic should be given in a dose \nthat will reach plasma levels that are three to four times the \nminimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the expected \nbacteria.67 The MIC is the lowest antibiotic concentration \nsuficient to destroy the speciic bacteria. Usually, to achieve \nthis cellular level the antibiotic must be given at twice the \ntherapeutic dose and at least 1 hour before surgery.68 It has \nbeen shown that normal therapeutic blood levels are ineffec-\ntive to counteract bacterial invasion. If antibiotic administra-\ntion occurs after bacterial contamination, no preventive \ninluence has been seen as compared with taking no preop-\nerative antibiotic.\nUse of the Shortest Effective Antibiotic60\nIn a healthy patient, continuing antibiotics after surgery often \ndoes not decrease the incidence of surgical wound infec-\ntions.69 A single dose of antibiotics is usually suficient. \nHowever, for patients or procedures with increased risk \nfactors, a longer dose of antibiotics is warranted.60 With the \nhigh degree of morbidity associated with dental implant \ninfections, one must weigh the beneits vs. risk involved for \nthe extended use of antibiotics.\nComplications of Antibiotic Prophylaxis. It is estimated \nthat approximately 6% to 7% of patients taking antibiotics \nwill have some type of adverse event.70 Incidence of signii-\ncant complications with the use of prophylactic antibiotics is \nminimal; however, a small percentage can be life threatening. \nThe risks associated with antibiotics include gastrointestinal \ntract complications, colonization of resistant or fungal \nstrains, cross-reactions with other medications, and allergic \nreactions.\nAllergic reactions have a wide range of complications, \nranging from mild urticaria to anaphylaxis and death. \nStudies have shown that 1% to 3% of the population \nreceiving penicillin will exhibit urticaria type of reactions, \nwith 0.04% to 0.011% having true anaphylactic episodes. \nOf this small percentage of anaphylactic reactions, 10% will \nbe fatal.71\nAn unusual but increasing complication in the general \npopulation after antibiotic use is pseudomembranous colitis. \nThis condition is caused by the intestinal lora being altered \nand colonized by Clostridium dificile. Penicillin and clinda-\nmycin use has been signiicantly associated with pseudomem-\nbranous colitis. All antibiotics have been shown as potential \ncausative agents. The most common treatment for antibiotic-\ninduced colitis is vancomycin or metronidazole.\nThe most recent concern with respect to antibiotic use is \nthe development of resistant bacteria. It has been observed \nthat the overgrowth of resistant bacteria begins only after \nthe host’s susceptible bacteria are killed, which usually takes \nat least 3 days of antibiotic use. Short-term (1-day) use of \nfactors. Antibiotic prophylaxis is only one component of this \ncomplex cascade, but the eficacy and impact of antimicrobial \nprophylaxis has been proven to be signiicant.62\nSeveral studies have concluded there is beneit from using \npreoperative antibiotics for dental implantology.63,64 In the \nmost comprehensive and controlled study to date, over 30 VA \nhospitals and dental schools formed the Dental Implant Clin-\nical Research Group and concluded the use of preoperative \nantibiotics signiicantly improved dental implant survival, \nboth in early and later stages. In the evaluation of 2973 \nimplants a signiicant difference was found with the use of \npreoperative antibiotics (4.6% failure) compared with no \nantibiotics (10% failure).63\nThe main goal of the use of prophylactic antibiotics is to \nprevent infection during the initial healing period from the \nsurgical wound site, thus decreasing the risk of infectious \ncomplications of the soft and hard tissues. Although there is \nno conclusive evidence on the mechanism of preoperative \nantibiotics, most likely a greater aseptic local environment is \nachieved.\nThe Appropriate Antibiotic for the Surgical \nProcedure Must Be Selected60\nThe prophylactic antibiotic should be effective against the \nbacteria that are most likely to cause an infection. In the \nmajority of cases, infections after surgery are from organisms \nthat originate from the site of surgery. Most postoperative \ninfections are caused by endogenous bacteria including \naerobic gram-positive cocci (streptococci), anaerobic gram-\npositive cocci (peptococci), and anaerobic gram-negative \nrods (bacteroides).6\nAlthough oral infections are mixed infections in which \nanaerobes outnumber aerobes 2:1, it has been shown that \nanaerobes need the aerobes to provide an environment to \nproliferate.65 Subsequent studies have shown that the early \nphase of intraoral infections involves streptococci that \nprepare the environment for subsequent anaerobic inva-\nsion.66 The ideal antibiotic must be effective against these \npathogens.\nLeast Toxic Antibiotic Should Be Selected\nThe second factor in selecting the correct antibiotic is to use \nthe antibiotic with the least amount of adverse effects. These \neffects may vary from mild nausea to an extreme allergic \nreaction.\nThe inal selection factor is that the antibiotic should \nideally be bactericidal. The goal of antibiotic prophylaxis is \nto kill and destroy the bacteria. Bacteriostatic antibiotics work \nby inhibiting growth and reproduction of bacteria, thus \nallowing the host defenses to eliminate the resultant bacteria. \nHowever, if the host’s defenses are compromised in any way, \nthe bacteria and infection may lourish. Bactericidal antibiot-\nics are advantageous over bacteriostatic antibiotics in that (1) \nthere is less reliance on host resistance, (2) the bacteria may \nbe destroyed by the antibiotic alone, (3) results are faster than \nwith bacteriostatic medications, and (4) there is greater lex-\nibility with dosage intervals."

Chlorhexidine gluco-\nnate is a potent antibacterial that causes lysis by binding to \nbacterial cell membranes. It has high substantivity that allows \nit, at high concentrations, to exhibit bactericidal qualities by \ncausing bacterial cytoplasm precipitation and cell death.73 In \nthe oral cavity, chlorhexidine has been shown to have a slow \nrelease from tissue surfaces over a 12-hour period.74\nIn vitro studies have shown an inhibitory effect of \nchlorhexidine on cultured epithelium and cell growth; \nhowever, clinical studies have not shown this effect.75 To the \ncontrary, the use of chlorhexidine has been shown to be an \neffective adjuvant in reducing plaque accumulation, enhanc-\ning mucosal health,76 improving soft tissue healing,77 treating \nperiodontal disease, preventing alveolar osteitis,78 improving \ntissue healing after extractions,79 reversing peri-implantitis,80 \nand it has been shown to have no adverse effect on implant \nsurfaces.81\nWhen evaluating the effect of preoperative chlorhexidine \nbefore dental implant surgery, a signiicant reduction in the \nnumber of infectious complications (2 to 1) and a sixfold \ndifference in implant failures compared to no use of chlorhex-\nidine has been shown.82\nUse of Chlorhexidine in Oral Implantology\nAs a consequence of many reported beneits of chlorhexidine, \nthe use of this antiseptic is suggested in many ways in oral \nimplantology as follows:\n• Patient presurgical rinse. It can be used in the aseptic \nprotocol before surgery for reduction of bacterial load\n• Surface antiseptic. It can be used in the intra- and \nextraoral scrub of patient, scrubbing of hands before \ngowns and gloves\n• Postsurgical rinse. Patient should rinse twice a day \nuntil incision line closure\n• Periimplant maintenance on daily basis. Treatment of \npostoperative infections.\nSTERILE TECHNIQUE\nIdeally, any surgical procedure where there may be an \nincreased bacterial insult should utilize a sterile technique. \nThere is much misunderstanding though, when it comes to \nthe terms clean, aseptic, and sterile.\n• Clean technique: The clean technique includes the routine \nhand washing, hand drying, and use of nonsterile gloves.\n• Aseptic technique: The aseptic technique is used for \nshort invasive procedures. It includes antiseptic hand \nwash, sterile gloves, antiseptic rinse, and use of a clean, \ndedicated area.\n• Sterile technique: The sterile technique includes measures \nto prevent the spread of bacteria from the environment to \nthe patient by eliminating all microorganisms in that envi-\nronment. This is mainly used for any procedure in which \nantibiotics has been shown to have little inluence on the \ngrowth of resistant bacteria.\nUse of Prophylactic Antibiotics in Oral Implantology. \nPostoperative wound infections can have a signiicant effect \non the success of dental implants and bone grafting proce-\ndures. The occurrence of surgical host defenses allows an \nenvironment conducive to bacterial growth. This process is \ncomplex, with interactions of host, local tissues, and systemic \nand microbial virulence factors. Various measures attempt to \nminimize infection by modifying the host and local tissue \nfactors. The use of antimicrobials has been shown to be sig-\nniicant in reducing postoperative infections.\nThe antibiotic chosen for prophylaxis should encompass \nthe bacteria most known to be responsible for the type of infec-\ntion found with the surgical procedure. The following antibiot-\nics are suggested against pathogens known to cause postoperative \nsurgical wound infections in bone grafting or implant surgery:\n• Amoxicillin is the drug of choice. If the patient is aller-\ngic, alternative drugs are:\nCephalexin (nonanaphylactic allergy to penicillin)\nClindamycin (anaphylactic allergy to penicillin)\n• Sinus involvement procedures (e.g., sinus grafts)\nAugmentin\nLevaquin (if history of recent use of Augmentin [within \n4 weeks])\nTreatment. When surgical wound infections arise, a speciic \ndiagnosis is advantageous to treat the complication. When \nevaluating the various antibiotics possible that are effective \nagainst the bacteria in question, a broad-spectrum beta-\nlactam antibiotic is most often the irst-line medication. The \nduration of treatment should include antibiotic administra-\ntion for 3 days beyond the occurrence of signiicant clinical \nimprovement, (usually at the fourth day) for a minimum of \n7 days.72\nTHERAPEUTIC ANTIBIOTICS  \nIN IMPLANT DENTISTRY\nThe recommended treatment for intraoral infections \nassociated with grafting or implant therapy include the \nfollowing:\n1. Surgical drainage\n2. Systemic antibiotics\n• Amoxicillin (500 mg)/two immediately, then one \ntablet three times daily for 1 week; or if penicillin \nallergy exists Clindamycin (300 mg)/two immedi-\nately, then one tablet three times daily for 1 week.\n• Note: If no improvement is seen after 4 days, a \nculture and sensitivity test can be administered to \nselect the antibiotic most effective against the \nresponsible organisms.\n• Until culture and sensitivity test results are obtained, \nchange antibiotic to Levaquin (500 mg)/one tablet \ndaily for 1 week and 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate \nrinse ( 12 oz twice daily for 2 weeks)."

The inner surface of the sterile ield, except for a \n1-inch border, is considered the sterile ield that may be used \nto add sterile items. This 1-inch border may also be used to \nposition the drape within the surgical ield. When placing \nsterile items onto the surgical ield, items may be “dropped” \nfrom approximately 6 inches above the sterile ield.\nSURGICAL SCRUB\nThe surgical scrub is the process that removes as many micro-\norganisms from the nail beds, hands, and forearms by \nmechanical washing and chemical antisepsis for a surgical \nprocedure. This will result in a decrease in microbial count \nand inhibits the regrowth of bacteria. There are two different \ntypes of scrubbing techniques, a sterile sponge/brush with \nantimicrobial agent or a brushless technique with alcohol/\nchlorhexidine gluconate (Figs. 8.23 and 8.24).\nAll rings, watches, bracelets, and jewelry should be \nremoved prior to starting the hand scrub. Surgical hats, \nprotective eyewear, headlights, and surgical mask must be \ndonned prior to surgical hand asepsis. Drying of the \nhands and arms is a priority because moist surfaces allow \nbacteria to multiply. Gowning, gloving, and tying the \nfront tie of the gown occur after the handscrub (Figs. 8.25 \nand 8.26).\nSUMMARY\nDuring the course of a career placing dental implants or \nperforming bone grafting procedures, a clinician will most \nlikely encounter situations where a patient presents with \ninfection. As illustrated in this chapter, a seemingly small \ninfection of an implant or graft has the potential to involve \nthe surgical spaces of the head and neck, causing life-\nthreatening episodes. The early signs of infection need to be \nrecognized and considered urgently, especially when the \npatient’s swallowing or breathing is compromised. Also, early \nsigns of cavernous sinus thrombosis need to be recognized \nand the patient referred immediately to a specialist.\nEndosteal implants are usually inserted beyond the apex \nposition of natural teeth. Subperiosteal implants traverse \nnatural barriers of infection when extended beyond muscle \nattachments (Fig. 8.27). Intraoral infections may extend to \nthe bacterial count needs to be lowered and an increase in \ninfection rate will lead to signiicant morbidity. This will \ninclude surgical hand scrub, hands dried with sterile \ntowels, complete sterile ield, sterile gown, mask, and \ngloves (Table 8.5, Boxes 8.6 and 8.7).\nAchieving surgical asepsis requires multiple steps includ-\ning surgical gloving and gowning along with maintaining \na sterile ield. Each member of the team involved in a \nsterile procedure is responsible for maintaining the aseptic \nenvironment.\nSTERILE FIELD\nSterile drapes are most often used within the sterile ield to \ncover any surgical area utilized during the surgery (Fig. 8.22). \nDrapes come in various sizes and are most easily purchased \nBOX 8.6 General Considerations of a \nSterile Technique\n• Only sterile materials and instruments are placed within \nthe sterile ield.\n• Check for chemical indicators to verify sterility of items \nplaced onto the sterile ield along with package integrity \nand package expiration (if appropriate).\n• Above and below the sterile ield table is considered \n“nonsterile.”\n• Materials that display a manufacturer’s expiration date \nshould be considered unsafe for use after that date. (Ratio-\nnale: Expiration dates do not guarantee either sterility or \nlack of sterility.)\n• If any sterile item (material, instrument, gown, glove) has \nbeen compromised, the package contents, gown, or the \nsterile ield is considered contaminated. This may happen \nwhen:\n• nonsterile items contact sterile items;\n• liquids or moisture soak through a drape, gown, or \npackage (strikethrough).\n• Single-use materials should only be used on an individual \npatient for a single procedure and then discarded.\n• Reusable medical devices shall be reprocessed and steril-\nized according to the manufacturer’s directions.\n• Any item that falls below table level is considered unsterile \n(see Fig. 8.22).\nTABLE 8.5 Clean vs. Aseptic vs. Sterile\n \nClean\nAseptic\nSterile\nProcedure space\nDental operatory\nSurgical suite\nSurgical suite\nGloves\nNonsterile\nSterile\nSterile surgical\nHand hygiene before the procedures\nRoutine\nAseptic (e.g., alcohol)\nSurgical scrub lodophors, chlorheximide\nSkin antisepsis\nNo\nAlcohol\nChlorhexidine\nSterile ield\nNo\nNo\nYes\nSterile gown, mask, head covering\nNo\nNo\nYes\nText continued on p. 326"

    "content": "321\nCHAPTER 8 Intraoperative Complications: Infection\nBOX 8.7 Sterile Technique\nStep 1: Prescrub Wash (see Fig. 8.23)\nA short prescrub wash is completed including the hands up to \nthe elbow. This is to remove supericial microorganisms and \ngross debris. (Duration = 1 minute)\n• Prior to the scrub, make sure surgical attire is worn and \nremove all jewelry. Glasses (loops, lights, etc.) should be \nplaced in the ideal position.\n• Perform a rinse from the inger tips to the elbows so the \nwater lows from the cleanest area (inger tips) to the less \nclean area (elbows). Utilize a sink that is wide and deep \nso that both arms are contained within the borders so that \nwater is not splashed out of the sink.\n• The next part of the prescrub is to clean the subungal area \nof each cuticle. With the disposable nail cleaning device, \nremove any debris from under each cuticle.\nStep 2: Primary Scrub (see Fig. 8.24)\nDepending on the hospital or surgical center, scrubbing \nmethods and protocol will vary. The counted stroke method \nseems to be the most eficient to guarantee sterility. This \ninvolves 10 strokes for each side of each inger (four sides), \n10 strokes for each side of the hand, and 10 strokes for each \nforearm side. Rinse hands and arms under running water in \nonly one direction, from inger tips to elbows. Care must be \nexercised to ensure ingers, hands, and arms do not touch \nany nonsterile surface (e.g., faucet). The hands should \nremain above the waist and below the axilla. If the water is \ncontrolled by hand-control levers, a nonsterile surgical assis-\ntant should turn the water off.\nStep 3: Gowning (see Fig. 8.25A–D)\nThe hands should be dried with a sterile towel. Care should be \nexercised to prevent the sterile gown or gloves from water \ncontamination. When moving from the scrub sink to the \nsterile area, keep hands in front of the body, above the waist, \nand below the axilla. The neckline, shoulders, underarms, \nand sleeve cuffs are considered nonsterile.\nThe sterile gown should be immediately donned after complete \ndrying of the hands and forearms, before gloving. Even \nthough the complete gown is sterile when placed on the \nsterile table, once the gown is donned, only the front \nfrom the waist to the axilla is sterile. The gown should \nbe lifted upward and away from the table and allowed to \nopen by locating the neckline and armholes. Hold the inside \nfront of the gown at the level of the armholes to allow \nthe gown to unfold. Do not touch the outside of the gown \nwith bare hands. Extend both arms into the armholes, and \nthe gown and sleeves will unfold. The gown is pulled \nonto the body with the cuffs of the sleeves extended \nover the hands. Do not push the hands completely through \nthe cuffs.\nSurgical gowns establish a barrier that minimizes the possibility \nof contamination from nonsterile to sterile areas, which is \ncommonly referred to as a “strikethrough” barrier. They are \nmade of a material that is resistant to blood and luid \npenetration.\nStep 4: Sterile Gloves (see Fig. 8.25E–I)\nSterile gloves are packaged in a sterile package. The closed-\ngloving technique is most widely used. It ensures the hands \nonly touch the inside of the gown and gloves. With the \ndominant hand, pick up the nondominant glove by the inner \nwrap straight up, placing it on the nondominant hand. Guide \nand wiggle the ingers into the glove. Using the gloved hand, \npick up the remaining glove and guide it on the nondominant \nhand, making sure the gown cuff is covered. The nondomi-\nnant glove will then pull the dominant glove cuff over \nthe gown.\nStep 5: Tying of the Gown (see Fig. 8.26)\nAfter the gown and gloves are in place, the front tie of the \ngown must be secured. The surgeon holds the left string \nwith the left hand and holds the right large string and tag \nwith the right hand. The tag is separated from the small \nstring and handed to an assistant. The surgeon rotates 360 \ndegrees and the assistant tears off the tag, leaving the right \nand left for the surgeon to tie.\nFIG 8.22 (A) Sterile surgical ield; blue table drapes are considered sterile.

Resnik\n9 \nIatrogenic injury with resultant sensory impairment of the skin \nand mucosa innervated by branches of the trigeminal nerve is a \nmajor concern in association with dental implant surgery. With \nthe increase in the number of implants being placed and more \npractitioners becoming involved with dental implant surgery, \nnerve damage will most likely be a continued problem in implant \ndentistry. The reported incidence of such nerve injuries follow-\ning dental implant procedures is highly variable (0% to 44%) in \nthe literature.1 Studies have shown that approximately 73% of \ndoctors who perform implant surgery have experienced postop-\nerative nerve complications.2 Libersa et al evaluated transient vs. \npermanent nerve injuries after implant placement and deter-\nmined a 75% incidence of permanent injury (Fig. 9.1).3\nWhen a nerve injury occurs, it is paramount the dental \nimplant surgeon be able to recognize the type and extent of \ninjury and provide the most appropriate postoperative care. \nTraumatic and iatrogenic nerve complications may involve \ntotal or partial nerve resection, crushing, thermal, stretching, \nor entrapment injuries. The resulting sensory deicits may \nrange from a nonpainful, minor loss of sensation (hypoesthe-\nsia), to a more permanent and severe debilitating pain dys-\nfunction (dysesthesia). Patients with neurosensory deicits \noften complain of symptoms that include interference with \nfunction, speaking, eating, kissing, facial soft tissue dysfunc-\ntion, and inability to complete everyday tasks such as shaving \nand placing make-up. The sensory problems often result in an \noverall decreased quality of life and long-standing psychologi-\ncal problems.4 Most patients ind accepting and coping with \neven minimal nerve injuries dificult to live with. The clinician \nis usually affected by increased complaints from the patients, \nembarrassment, with signiicant medicolegal implications.\nIn the ield of oral implantology today, the clinician must \nhave a thorough understanding of the etiology, prevention, \nand treatment of neurosensory impairments. The authors \nhave developed postoperative guidelines for diagnosis and \npossible management of neurosensory deicits following \ndental implant surgery that are dependent on the history, \ntype, and nature of the injury.\nANATOMY\nPERIPHERAL NERVE FIBER ANATOMY\nThe individual nerve ibers of peripheral nerves are situated \nin fascicles, which are bundles or groups of nerve ibers. \nFor example, the inferior alveolar nerve is classiied as polyfas-\ncicular, meaning that it contains more than 10 fascicles sur-\nrounded by an abundance of interfascicular connective tissue. \nWithin the fascicles, there are approximately 7000–12,000 \naxons in various fascicular arrangements.5 The number of \nfascicles varies along the intramandibular course of the infe-\nrior alveolar nerve because there are approximately 18–21 \nfascicles in the third molar region, decreasing to 12 fascicles in \nthe mental foramen area.6 Because of the polyfascicular nature \nof the inferior alveolar nerve, it is better able to regain sensa-\ntion after injury via compensatory innervation from the unin-\njured fascicles. Surrounding the polyfascicular makeup of this \nnerve is the perineurium, which consists of dense, multilay-\nered connective tissue. The perineurium functions to main-\ntain intrafascicular pressure and acts as a diffusion barrier in \nthe protection of the individual nerve ibers. Two types of \nconnective tissue, the inner and outer epineurium, surround \nthe fascicles. The inner epineurium is composed of loose con-\nnective tissue with longitudinal collagen bundles. This tissue \nprotects the nerve ibers against compressive and stretching \nforces, thus maintaining the structural continuity of the nerve. \nThe outer epineurium is continuous with the mesoneurium, \nwhich is the outer loose areolar tissue that suspends the nerve \ntrunk within the soft tissue and contains the blood supply to \nthe nerve. The mesoneurium allows the nerve to have longi-\ntudinal movement within the surrounding tissue.\nIf any of these extraneural tissues (epineurium, perineurium, \nendoneurium, or mesoneurium) is injured, impaired neural \ntransmission by the individual nerve ibers may result in a \nsensory disturbance. The neurosensory impairment is depen-\ndent on the individual iber type that is involved. The A-alpha \nibers are the largest ibers; mediate position and ine touch \nthrough muscle spindle afferents and skeletal muscle efferents. \nThe A-beta ibers are solely for proprioception, and the A-delta \ncarries the initial pain impulses along with temperature informa-\ntion. Unmyelinated C-ibers are slow conducting and function \nfor the perception of “second” or slow pain with an additional \ntemperature component. For dental implant surgeons the \nprimary concern is loss of sensory functions such as touch, pres-\nsure, pain, and temperature following trauma (Fig. 9.2).\nTRIGEMINAL NERVE\nThe trigeminal nerve is the ifth cranial nerve and largest of \nthe 12 cranial nerves.

The incisive canals fuse and form a \ncommon Y-shaped canal that exits lingual to the central \nincisor teeth (incisive foramen or incisive fossa). The naso-\npalatine nerve passes through these canals and provides \nsensation to the anterior palate. These nerves (also termed \nincisive nerves) terminate at the nasal loor and enter the oral \ncavity via the incisive canal, which is underneath the incisive \npapilla. To prevent trauma to these nerves, ideal presurgical \nplanning of implant placement in the maxillary incisor region \nshould be carefully evaluated (Fig. 9.4).\nClinical signiﬁcance.

The canal runs forward \nand downward to the inferior wall of the orbit and, after reach-\ning the edge of the anterior nasal aperture in the inferior tur-\nbinate, it follows the lower margin of the nasal aperture and \nopens to the side of the nasal septum.11 Studies have shown \nthat in approximately 15% of the population, this area is \ndescribed as foramina that are 1–2 mm in diameter. The canals \npresent as a direct extension of the canalis sinuosus and may \nbe clinically relevant when greater than 2.0 mm12 (Fig. 9.6).\nClinical relevance. Because the canine pillar region is a \ncommon area for dental implants, care should be taken to \ncheck for the presence of neurovascular bundles of the infra-\norbital canal. Insertion of implants in approximation to the \ncanal may be problematic. Impingement into the canal may \nlead to a soft tissue interface and failure of the implant and \ntemporary or permanent sensory dysfunction and possible \nbleeding issues.13 However, signiicant sensory impairments \nare rare because of cross innervation. Many clinicians are \nunaware of the canalia sinuosus and may misdiagnose this \nradiolucency as apical pathology of the maxillary cuspid.\nV3: Mandible\nThe mandibular nerve is the largest of the trigeminal branches \nand is the most common branch involved with neurosensory \ndisturbances following dental implant surgery. The mandibu-\nlar nerve is the lowest branch of the trigeminal nerve, which \nruns along the loor of the cranium, exiting through the \nforamen ovale into the infratemporal fossa. It has two \nsensory disturbances are rare. Nerve damage reported in the \nliterature caused by complete removal9 or lap surgery10 is of \nshort duration. This is most likely due to cross innervation \nof the greater palatine nerve on the anterior palatal area.\nInfraorbital Nerve. The infraorbital nerve emerges from the \ninfraorbital foramen and gives off four branches: the inferior \npalpebral, external nasal, internal nasal, and the superior \nlabial branches, which are sensory to the lower eyelid, cheek, \nand upper lip. The inferior palpebral branches supply the skin \nand conjunctiva of the lower eyelid. The nasal branches \nsupply the lateral nose soft tissue and the movable part of the \nnasal septum, and the superior labial branches supply the \nskin of the cheek and upper lip. Normally, the average dis-\ntance of the inferior border of the orbital rim to the infraor-\nbital foramen is 4.6 mm to 10.4 mm (Fig. 9.5).\nClinical signiﬁcance. Impairment of the infraorbital nerve \nmay be very traumatic to patients. Damage to branches of the \ninfraorbital nerve usually will result from retraction-related \ntrauma (neuropraxia). Procedures involving the maxillary \ncuspid-bicuspid area are most susceptible to injuries. Ana-\ntomic variants of the infraorbital foramen have been shown to \nbe up to 14 mm from the orbital rim. This is most likely seen \nin elderly female patients with extensive alveolar atrophy.\nAnterior Superior Alveolar Nerve.

Nerve impairment to the inferior \nalveolar nerve (mental nerve) is a common clinical complica-\ntion with major medicolegal implications. Because of its ana-\ntomic location, the mental nerve is the most common nerve \nto be damaged via implants or bone graft procedures. Trauma \nusually occurs from placement of implants directly into the \nforamen or into the inferior alveolar canal in the posterior \nmandible. Sensory nerve injury may result in altered sensa-\ntion, complete numbness, and/or pain, which may interfere \nwith speech, eating, drinking, shaving, or make-up applica-\ntion and lead to social embarrassment.\nLingual Nerve. Within the infratemporal fossa, the lingual \nnerve divides from the posterior division of the mandibular \nnerve (V3) as a terminal branch. As the lingual nerve proceeds \nanteriorly, it lies against the medial pterygoid muscle and medial \nto the mandibular ramus. It then passes inferiorly to the supe-\nrior constrictor attachment and courses anteroinferiorly to the \nlateral surface of the tongue. As it runs forward deep to the \nsubmandibular gland, it terminates as the sublingual nerve.\nThe lingual nerve is sensory to the anterior two thirds of \nthe tongue, loor of the mouth, and lingual gingiva. It also \ncontains visceral afferent and efferent ibers from cranial \nnerve seven (facial nerve) and from the chorda tympani, \nwhich relays taste information. With the prevalence of second \nmolar implants, care should be taken to note the possible \nposition of the lingual nerve on the medial ridge of the ret-\nromolar triangle, where it courses anteriorly along the supe-\nrior lingual alveolar crest, which is slightly lingual to the teeth \n(Fig. 9.8).15\nClinical relevance. Due to the lingual nerve’s variable \nanatomic location, it may be iatrogenically traumatized during \nvarious implant surgical procedures. Usually the lingual nerve \nis not damaged from the actual osteotomy preparation of \nimplants unless the lingual plate is perforated. This sensory \nnerve is most likely traumatized during soft tissue relection \nduring implant placement in the second molar area or \nincision/relection over the retromolar pad for bone graft pro-\ncedures. Additionally, the lingual nerve can suffer damage \nfrom lingual lap retraction and inferior alveolar nerve blocks. \nStudies have shown that lingual nerve impairment after nerve \nblocks occurs twice as often as inferior alveolar nerve damage.16 \nThis is most likely due to the fact the lingual nerve is most \ncommonly unifascular at the site of the injection. Sensory \ndamage to the lingual nerve may cause a wide spectrum of \ncomplications ranging from complete anesthesia to paraesthe-\nsia, dysesthesia, drooling, tongue biting, change in taste per-\nception, and change in speech pattern.\nNERVE INJURIES\nETIOLOGY\nMost implant-related nerve impairments are the direct result \nof poor treatment planning and inadequate radiographic \nthe chin, lip, and anterior gingiva. The incisive nerve contin-\nues anterior and innervates the mandibular anterior teeth. \nAccurately determining the exact location of the inferior \nalveolar nerve as it courses through the body of the mandible \nis imperative to avoid neurosensory disturbances secondary \nto implant placement (Fig. 9.7).\nHistologically, this IAN consists of connective tissue and \nneural components in which the smallest functional unit is the \nindividual nerve iber. The IAN ibers may be either myelinated \nor unmyelinated. The myelinated nerve ibers are the most \nabundant; they consist of a single axon encased individually by \na single Schwann cell.

And lastly, peripheral nerves have \nbeen shown to be susceptible to chemical injuries, where the \nnerve is directly traumatized by chemical solutions.\nAdministration of Local Anesthesia\nAdequate local anesthesia is paramount for successful dental \nimplant surgery and stress reduction protocol. However, \nalthough rare, the use of nerve blocks may result in trauma \nto various branches of the trigeminal nerve. The exact etiol-\nogy of local anesthesia nerve damage is unclear, and various \ntheories such as injection needle trauma, hematoma forma-\ntion, and local anesthetic toxicity have been discussed. \nAlthough the true incidence is dificult to quantify, studies \nhave shown permanent injury occurs in approximately 1 in \n25,000 inferior nerve blocks. Most patients do recover fully \nwithout deicits, with full recovery in 85% of patients with \ncomplete remission in 8–10 weeks.17\nNeedle. Complications resulting from needle trauma are \nlikely the most common theory on why nerve injury results \nafter administering nerve blocks. First, it is not uncommon \nfor the tip of the needle to become barbed (damaged) when \ncontacting bone. Stace et al showed that 78% of needles \nbecame barbed after initial injection, increasing the possibil-\nity of damaging the nerve. Two-thirds of the needles devel-\noped outward-facing barbs, which have been shown to \nrupture the perineurium, damage the endoneurium, and \ncause transection of nerve ibers.18 The lingual nerve has been \nassociated with the highest percentage of nerve impairment \ncases as a result of an anesthetic injection (∼70%)19. Because \nof the lingual nerve’s anatomic location, it is predisposed to \nnerve injuries because it is commonly contacted when using \nthe pterygomandibular raphe as an injection landmark due \nto the nerve being positioned shallow in the tissue (∼3–5 mm \nfrom the mucosa).20\nHematoma. The anesthetic needle may also cause damage to \nthe epineurial blood vessels, which may result in hemorrhage-\nrelated compression on the nerve ibers. The accumulation of \nblood may lead to ibrosis and scar formation, which may \ncause pressure-related trauma.21 The extent of impairment to \nthe nerve is directly related to the amount of pressure exerted \nby the hematoma and recovery time of the axonal and con-\nnective tissue damage.\nAnesthetic Toxicity. If the anesthetic is injected within the \nfascicular space, chemical irritation and damage may occur. \nStudies have shown articaine to comprise 54% of mandibular \nnerve block injuries,22 and it is 21 times more likely to cause \ninjury in comparison to other nerve injuries.23 Theories con-\ncerning articaine toxicity include the high concentration of \narticaine solution24 and the increased resultant inlammatory \nreaction.25 Lidocaine has been shown to be the least toxic \nanesthetic followed by articaine, mepivacaine, and bupiva-\ncaine.26 Chemical trauma from local anesthetics has been \nshown to cause demyelination and axon degeneration of \nnerve ibers.27\nevaluation. Nerve trauma occurs when the implant clinician \nis not aware of the amount of bone or does not know the \nlocation of nerve canals or foramens. Preoperative planning \nis crucial to determine the amount of available bone in \napproximation to a nerve structure, location of vital struc-\ntures, bone density, and location for proper placement of \nimplants. A cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) \nexamination is most commonly used for the three-dimensional \nplanning in these areas.\nNerve injuries may result from various intraoperative and \npostoperative complications. Nerves may be mechanically \ninjured by indirect or direct trauma via retraction, laceration, \npressure, stretching, and transection. Thermal trauma may \ncause inlammation and secondary ischemia injuries with \nFIG 9.8 (A–B) Lingual nerve anatomy and variant positions. \nNote the proximity to the crest of the ridge in the “high” \nvariant position.

The implant clinician \nshould use the initial implant osteotomy twist drill as a gauge \nfor bone density type and for an evaluation of the position \nof the surgical drill relative to the mandibular canal. In \nimplant dentistry today the overzealous use of immediate \nimplants has been associated with an increase of drilling-\nrelated trauma. To gain primary stability, most immediate \nimplant osteotomy sites require drill preparation and implant \nplacement apical to the extraction site. When placing implants \nin the mandibular premolar area, violation of the canal may \noccur, causing nerve damage. Therefore in this anatomic area, \nimmediate implant placement is not recommended unless \nadequate bone is available below the root apex.\nThe following are the types of surgical drill trauma that \nmay lead to a neurosensory impairment:\nDrill Encroachment. The surgical drill may cause a nerve \nimpairment from thermal damage even though the surgical \ndrill does not violate the mandibular canal. Most commonly, \nthis is the result of insuficient irrigation, which leads to \noverheating the bone. Thermal trauma may lead to nerve \nimpairment via bone necrosis from overheating the bone \nduring preparation. Nerve tissue has been shown to be more \nsensitive to thermal trauma than bone (osseous) tissue. \nExcessive temperatures have been shown to produce necrosis, \nibrosis, degeneration, and increased osteoclastic involve-\nment.28 To minimize this complication the bone density \nshould be evaluated preoperatively via CBCT examination, \ntactile evaluation, and by location.\nPartial Penetration. The surgical drill may also cause direct \ntrauma to the neurovascular bundle by penetrating the man-\ndibular canal or mental foramen. The neurosensory impair-\nment will be directly proportional to the speciic nerve \nfascicles that are damaged. Normally, the vein and artery, \nwhich are positioned more superiorly than the nerve, will be \ndamaged when penetration of the canal results. Indirect \ntrauma may also cause nerve damage from the excessive \nbleeding (hematoma), as well as thermal and chemical inju-\nries from the penetration into the canal.\nTransection. The most severe type of nerve injury, with the \nlowest probability of regeneration, is when the implant \ndrill transects the canal. Because the nerve is usually com-\npletely severed, repair and regeneration is highly variable. \nThis type of injury will usually result in anesthesia-type \nsymptoms and neuroma formation with possible dysesthesia \nsymptoms (Fig. 9.10).\nImplant Encroachment on the Mandibular Canal. Injuries \nto vital nerve structures due to implant positioning are most \nSoft Tissue Relection\nInjury to nerves and nerve ibers may occur during the relec-\ntion, retraction, or suturing of the soft tissue. This is most \nnoted when the mental nerve is dehiscenced or exposed on \nthe mandibular ridge. Special caution should be exercised \nwhen making incisions over these areas because complete \ntransection injuries may occur from incisions through the \nnerve or foramen. Stretching injuries (neuropraxia) may \noccur from excessive retraction, so care should be noted as to \nthe proximity of neural vital structures within the retracted \ntissue. Complete transection of the nerve results from stretch-\ning the tissue to reduce tension over the lap without regard \nto the anatomic location of the nerve (Fig. 9.9).\nImplant Drill Trauma\nNeurosensory impairment may result from direct or indirect \ntrauma from the osteotomy sites. Direct trauma may occur \nfrom overpreparation of the osteotomy site or lack of knowl-\nedge of the true bur length. The implant clinician must know \nand understand the true length of the surgical burs used in \nthe osteotomy site preparation. The marked millimeter gauge \nlines inscribed on the shank of the drills most often do not \ninclude the cutting edge of the drill and do not correspond \nto the actual depth of the drill.

Additional \nstudies have shown the presence of postoperative severe pain \nafter implant placement in close approximation to the canal \nresulting in chronic stimulation and debilitating chronic \nneuropathy.30\nPartial Penetration Into Mandibular Canal. Placement of \nthe implant body into the mandibular canal is associated with \na high degree of morbidity. The sensory nerve fascicles are \nusually inferior to blood vessels within the canal, and the type \nand extent of injury is proportional to the ibers that are \ndamaged. This is why in some cases the implant is directly \nwithin the canal; however, no neurosensory symptoms exist. \nAdditionally, implant placement into the canal may cause \nhematoma formation (severing of the inferior alveolar artery \nor vein), leading to a nerve impairment.\nPerforation Through the Entire Canal. Complete transec-\ntion of the nerve occurs when surgical error involves the \npreparation of an osteotomy too deep due to inaccurate mea-\nsurements or slippage of the handpiece. This type of injury \nresults in the most severe of response, a total nerve impair-\nment (anesthesia) and neuroma formation. Usually this type \nof nerve injury results in a complete anesthesia and retro-\ngrade degeneration resulting in future dysesthesia.27 The \nextent of neurosensory impairment is proportional to the \nextent of fascicle injury and is dependent upon the time \nthe implant is left to irritate the nerve ibers.\nInfection. Placement of implants in approximation to the \ncanal may cause neurosensory impairments via periimplant \ninfections. Infectious processes after implant placement may \nresult from heat generation, contamination, or prior exis-\ntence of bone pathology. This may lead to spread of infection \nthat may extend into the neural anatomy. Case reports have \nshown nerve impairment issues resulting from an implant \ninfected by chronic peri-implantitis.31\nMandibular Socket Grafting. After mandibular tooth \nextractions, grafting into the socket may effectively expose the \ninferior alveolar nerve to socket medicaments. This may lead \nto chemical neuritis and, if the irritation persists, an irrevers-\nible neuropathy may occur (Fig. 9.12). Additionally, care \nshould be exercised when removing pathology and granula-\ntion tissue from extraction sockets in close proximity to the \nnerve canal (type 1 nerve).32 Overzealous curretting of the \nsocket apex may lead to direct traumatic injury of the canal.\nDelayed Nerve Damage (Canal Narrowing).

There are two types of nerve degeneration: \nsegmental degeneration and Wallerian degeneration. Seg-\nmental demyelination occurs when the myelin sheath is \ndamaged and causes a slowing of the conduction velocity, \nwhich may prevent the transmission of nerve impulses. The \nresulting effects will clinically be paresthesia, dysesthesia, or \nhyperesthesia. The second type of degeneration is termed \nWallerian degeneration, in which the axons and myelin sheath \ndistal (away from central nervous system [CNS]) to the injury \nundergo complete disintegration (Fig. 9.13). The axons prox-\nimal to the site of injury (towards the CNS) undergo less \ndegeneration, but many nodes of Ranvier (periodic gaps in \nthe myelin sheaths of axons that facilitate the rapid conduc-\ntion of nerve impulses) are affected. Wallerian degeneration \nusually occurs after complete transection of the nerve and \nresults in dysesthesia type of symptoms.\nin excessive narrowing of the canal with compression of the \nnerve ibers. The narrowed aspect of the canal was shown to \nbe approximately 0.2 mm, with an average diameter in the \nnonaffected sites being approximately 3.2 mm.33 The nerve \nimpairment (paresthesia and anesthesia) occurred 2 years \nafter implant placement surgery.\nPHYSIOLOGIC RESPONSE\nThe incidence of nerve impairment has been shown to be \npatient speciic. Studies have shown that females and older \npatients are at greater risk of nerve deicits. As patients age, \nneural cell body regeneration has been shown to be much \nslower.34 Women have been shown to have greater associated \npain and nerve impairment in comparison to men because \nof lower pain thresholds, greater chance of seeking treatment \nin comparison to men, and an increased tendency to \ncommunicate their problems.35\nThere are many local and host-related factors that deter-\nmine the neurologic response to a nerve injury. Older indi-\nviduals exhibit slower and less dramatic cell body regeneration \nin comparison to younger individuals. The type of injury is \nthe most signiicant local factor relating to the neurologic \nresponse after trauma. Injuries that occur at the proximal site \nof the peripheral nerve are usually more signiicant in com-\nparison to those that occur at distal sites.9 In the event any of \nthe extraneural tissues (epineurium, perineurium, endoneu-\nrium, or mesoneurium) are injured or traumatized, impaired \nneural transmission may result in a sensory disturbance. The \nresultant neurosensory impairment is dependent on the \nvarying functional units of the individual iber type involved. \nA-alpha ibers are the largest ibers and mediate position and \nine touch by way of muscle spindle afferents and skeletal \nmuscle efferents. The A-beta ibers are mainly proprioceptive \nin nature, and A-delta ibers mediate initial pain impulses \nalong with temperature information. The C-ibers are unmy-\nelinated and slow conducting, which allow the perception of \npain and temperature.4\nWhen complete transection of a nerve occurs, within 96 \nhours the proximal end of the nerve iber shrinks approxi-\nmately 20% to 50% in diameter and usually will not recover \nmore than 80% of its original size.10 Shortly thereafter, axonal \nnerve sprouts will seek and extend out to the degenerating \ndistal branch. Each axon may contain up to 50 collateral \nsprouts and advance approximately 1–3 mm per day and \neventually attempt to reinnervate the target tissue. If the nerve \nsprouts are unable to reconnect, forward progress is stopped \nand Wallerian degeneration will occur. Wallerian degenera-\ntion is the process resulting from a damaged nerve iber in \nwhich part of the axon is separated from the neurons cell \nbody. This may also be known as anterograde or orthograde \ndegeneration.35a Wallerian degeneration usually results in \nneuroma (benign growth) formation, which is associated with \nincreased mechanical and chemical sensitivity, resulting in \nchronic neurosensory deicits.11\nQuick, immediate treatment is highly recommended in \nneurosensory impairment cases. Nerve iber atrophy has been \nshown to occur with trauma over 6 hours.36 After 3 months, \nFIG 9.13 Wallerian degeneration resulting with inadequate \nnerve repair.

Usually, regeneration occurs immediately \nafter nerve injury. The proximal nerve area sprouts out new \nibers that grow at a rate of 1.0–1.5 mm per day. This will \ncontinue until the site innervated by the nerve is reached or \nblocked by ibrous connective tissue, bone, or object (e.g., \ndental implant). During the regeneration process, new myelin \nsheaths form as axons increase in size. In some situations the \ncontinuity of the Schwann cells is disrupted, and connective \ntissue may enter the area. The growth may ind an alternative \npath, or it may form a traumatic neuroma, which is usually \ncharacterized by signiicant pain.

In 1943 Seddon postulated a three-stage classiication, \nwhich was later reclassiied by Sunderland in 1951 into ive \ndifferent subclassiications. These nerve injury classiications \nare described by the resultant morphophysiologic type of \ninjury, which is based on the time course and amount of \nsensory recovery (Fig. 9.15).\nNeuropraxia, or irst-degree injury, is characterized by a \nconduction block with no degeneration of the axon or visible \ndamage of the epineurium. Usually, this type of injury is \nconsistent with stretching or manipulation (relection of \ntissue) of the nerve ibers, which results in injury to the endo-\nneurial capillaries. The degree of trauma to the endoneurial \ncapillaries will determine the magnitude of intrafascicular \nedema, which results in various degrees of conduction block. \nUsually, resolution of sensation and function will occur \nwithin hours to weeks.\nAxonotmesis (second-, third-, or fourth-degree injury) \nconsists of degeneration or regeneration axonal injuries.

Neuro-\nsensory impairments are classiied from complete numb-\nness to severe pain of the facial soft tissues to the intraoral \nanatomy. Because of these deicits, severe complications \nresult for the patient and the clinician. A thorough under-\nstanding of the associated classiications and deinitions is \nnecessary (Tables 9.1 and 9.2).\nTo standardize the nomenclature concerning nerve inju-\nries, the International Association for the Study of Pain \nreduced sensory impairment into three categories: anesthesia, \nparesthesia, and dysesthesia.40a Anesthesia is characterized \nby the complete lack of “feeling,” which is usually consistent \nwith complete transection of the nerve. This type of altered \nsensation is most severe because anesthesias are the most dif-\nicult and unpredictable to treat with a high incidence of \nneuroma formation. Paresthesia is deined as an altered sensa-\ntion that is not unpleasant. It is usually characterized as a \n“pins and needles” feeling. Within the paraesthesia category, \nThis type of injury involves the endoneurium, with minimum \ndisruption to the perineurium and epineurium. The most \ncommon type of injuries are traction, stretching, and com-\npression, which can lead to severe ischemia, intrafascicular \nedema, or demyelination of the nerve ibers. Initially, \ncomplete anesthesia is most common, which is followed by \nparesthesia as recovery begins. Improvement of the related \nsensory deicits occurs within approximately 2–4 months \nwith complete recovery usually within 12 months. In some \ncases, painful dysesthesias are possible with resulting neuroma \nformation.\nNeurotmesis (ifth-degree injury) is the most severe type of \ninjury, resulting from severe traction, compression, or com-\nplete transection injuries.

The implant clinician must \nirst determine if a neurosensory deicit exists by mapping the \narea of deicit. This diagnostic examination consists of objec-\ntive and subjective indings to determine the extent of impair-\nment, to use as a baseline for future evaluation, and to \ndetermine when referral for surgical intervention is required.\nThe subjective clinical sensory tests involve nociceptive \nand mechanoceptive examinations. Nociceptive tests trigger \na variety of autonomic responses that result in the subjective \nexperience of pain. Mechanoceptive tests utilize mechanical \nstimuli to trigger sensory neurons that elicit various responses \nsuch as touch, position and motion (Table 9.3 and Fig. 9.17).\nClinical examination complications. There exist many \ninherent problems with relying on the credibility of the \npatient’s subjective responses. Because there may exist a high \ndegree of false-positive and false-negative results, clinicians \nshould utilize clear and concise instructions when adminis-\ntering these tests. For instance, when administering the \n“directional movement” test, the clinician should complete \nthis test on the contralateral side irst so the patient under-\nstands the technique and response. The results of the subjec-\ntive clinical examination will depend on good communication \nbetween the implant clinician and the patient, with the \noutcome of the results related to the patient’s perceived inter-\npretation and how to relate their perceptions. Additionally, \nthe tests should be administered with the patient’s eyes closed, \nso as to minimize the possibility of incorrect responses.\nStep 2: Radiographic Evaluation/Removal or Repositioning \nof the Implant. A thorough and comprehensive radiographic \nexamination should be completed including (ideally) a CBCT \nradiograph. If the implant (or bone screw) is in close approxi-\nmation of the nerve bundle, removal or repositioning should \nbe completed. Care should be exercised in “backing” the implant \nout (repositioning farther from the nerve) because trauma to \nthe nerve may still be present from hematoma formation or \npressure from cancellous bone crushed into the neural space. \nAdditionally, backing the implant out may lead to the implant \nbeing positioned undesirably because of lack of interocclusal \nspace for the restoration (i.e., too coronally positioned). In these \ncases, the implant should be removed and the osteotomy site \nirrigated with 4% Dexamethasone (1–2 mL). No graft materials \nshould be added to the osteotomy site because they may inter-\nfere with the reinnervation and repair of the nerve trunk.41\nStep 3: Pharmacologic Intervention. Immediately after the \nnerve is traumatized, the inlammatory process begins with \nthe activation of cytokines and inlammatory mediators. \nThese inlammatory mediators will contribute to the devel-\nopment of nerve trauma by activating the neurons and their \nnociceptors.42\nWith any type of nerve impairment, corticosteroids or \nnonsteroidal antiinlammatory agents should be used imme-\ndiately. Studies have shown that the use of systemic adreno-\ncorticosteroids (e.g., Dexamethasone) minimizes neuropathic \nsymptoms following nerve trauma if administered in high \ndoses within 1 week of injury.43 It has been advocated that a \ntapering dose of a corticosteroid for 5–7 days following tri-\ngeminal nerve injury is beneicial.44 Dexamethasone (∼8 mg)"

Cryotherapy has been shown \nto be beneicial in minimizing secondary nerve injury from \nedema-induced compression, decreasing the metabolic \ndegeneration rate of trigeminal ganglion cells and slowing \npotential neuroma formation.45 Additional physiologic agents \ninclude transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation, acupunc-\nture, and low-level laser therapy.\nStep 4: Possible Referral. In certain situations, patients \nmay need to be referred in a timely manner to a practitioner \nexperienced in nerve injury assessment and repair. The deci-\nsion and timing to refer should be based on the patient’s \nsymptoms and the type of injury, along with the experience \nof the implant dentist in treating nerve injuries. Usually, suf-\nicient time is given for neurosensory recovery. In cases of \ndysesthesia, anesthesia, or known nerve transection, prompt \nsurgical intervention may allow for the best chance of neuro-\nsensory recovery. Early, aggressive treatment has been shown \nto minimize possible transition to chronic refractory neu-\nropathies (Table 9.4).16\nStep 5: Follow-Up Care. Follow-up care should always be a \ncomponent of the treatment of a nerve impairment patient. \nThe interval between appointments is determined by the \nextent and type of nerve injury (see Table 9.4). Usually, after \nthe one week postoperative, patients are seen every 2 weeks \nwith mapping and documentation of the deicits noted.\nSurgical Intervention\nIn some cases of neurosensory impairment, surgical repair is \nindicated. In general, early treatment is crucial to success and \ndecreased morbidity. Microneurosurgical procedures include \ndirect nerve repair via primary anastomoses of the two \nsevered ends for transection injuries. For nerve splits, rees-\ntablishment and proper alignment of nerve stumps will allow \nfor the best chance to correct regeneration of the damaged \nnerves (Fig. 9.18).\nPREVENTION\nIatrogenic injuries to the third division of the trigeminal \nnerve pose a common and complex problem in implant \ndentistry today. Neurosensory impairment in the head and \nneck region may affect the patient’s quality of life and can \npresent potentially signiicant medicolegal problems for the \nclinician. To prevent damage to vital nerve structures, it is \nimperative for the implant dentist to have a comprehensive \nradiographic survey of the region, a thorough knowledge of \nthe normal vs. variant anatomy, and awareness of intra-\noperative surgical techniques to minimize the possibility of \nnerve impairment.\nRadiographic Considerations\nUnderstand Disadvantages and Limitations of Two-\nDimensional Radiography. Today, the sole use of two-\ndimensional radiography is becoming less common for \ntreatment planning of dental implant patients. Two-\ndimensional radiographs, mainly panoramic, have many \ninherent disadvantages in evaluating potential implant sites. \nAll panoramic (2-D) radiographs exhibit some degree of dis-\ntortion, nonuniform magniication, and image superimposi-\ntion, which can potentially lead to incorrect measurement"

In most cases, a three-\ndimensional radiographic modality is recommended for \nevaluation of the mandibular arch and related nerve anatomy. \nTo determine the ideal location and measurement parameters \nassociated with the dental implant placement, the clinician \nmust be able to accurately measure the distance between the \nalveolar crest and the superior border of the mandibular \ncanal, as well as the width of bone in the proposed implant \nsite. Medical slice computed tomography (MSCT) and CBCT \nimages have been shown to be the most accurate radiographic \nmodalities in the assessment of available bone and identiica-\ntion of the inferior alveolar nerve.1,48 A thorough knowledge \nof the relative three-dimensional (3-D) position of the infe-\nrior alveolar nerve is crucial in preventing mandibular nerve \nimpairment prior to implant placement (Fig. 9.20A).\nUse Interactive Treatment Planning Software for Evalua-\ntion of the Posterior Mandible. Because MSCT and CBCT \nhave been proven to be 1 : 1 (no magniication), the implant \ndentist has the ability to place implants, measure available \nbone, evaluate bone density, and order surgical templates \ndirectly from their computerized treatment plan. Interactive \ntreatment planning software programs available today contain \nlibraries of most implants systems, which allow the clinician \nto accurately access the size, type, and ideal placement of the \nimplant in relation to anatomic structures. This virtual treat-\nment plan may then be transferred to the patient’s surgery by \nmeans of a surgical template or computer-assisted navigation \nsystem (Fig. 9.20B–C).\nUse of Bone Models. For implant dentists early on their \nlearning curve, the fabrication of a bone model can be an \ninvaluable preoperative diagnostic tool. Bone models are \nmade directly from the CT Dicom data, which involves a \nthird-party vendor fabrication through some type of 3-D \nprinter, such as stereolithography. The clinician is able to \nevaluate the exact osseous morphology (width of bone, \nundercuts, bony landmarks) and location of vital structures \n(color coded within the model) prior to the actual surgery. \nImplant osteotomies may be performed in a laboratory \nsetting to allow the implant dentist to complete the procedure \nprior to surgery.\nUse of Surgical Templates. Neurosensory impairment \nissues are most frequently an inadvertent sequela of improper \ndiagnosis, treatment planning, or surgical technique. Many of \nthese complications can be overcome by using three-\ndimensional surgical guides for the ideal positioning and \nplacement of implants. Basically, the surgical guide is the \nconduit for transferring the interactive treatment plan from \nthe computer to the patient’s actual surgical procedure. This \nallows the implant dentist to be able to place the implants in \nthe exact location as per the treatment plan. Surgical guides \nFIG 9.19 (A) 2-D panoramic radiographs exhibit many inherent \ninaccuracies and should never be solely relied upon in making \nmeasurements because they provide nonuniform magniica-\ntion.

There is a common \nbelief that the vertical position of the inferior alveolar nerve \nis relatively constant within the mandible. Normally, the IAN \nruns a concave path from posterior to anterior, with anterior \nsegments exiting the mental foramen and a branch that \nascends to the midline of the mandible. However, studies have \nconirmed the inferior-superior (vertical) positions of the \ninferior alveolar nerve are not consistent.50,51 An early classi-\nication of the vertical positions of the course of the alveolar \nnerve was reported by Carter and Keen.52 They described \nthree distinct types: (1) in close approximation to the apices \nof the teeth, (2) a large nerve approximately in the middle of \nthe mandible with individual nerves supplying the mandibu-\nlar teeth, and (3) a nerve trunk close to the inferior cortical \nplate with large plexuses to the mandibular teeth. In type 1 \nnerves, impairment is very common because of the close \nproximity to the nerve bundle. Three percent of patients can \nhave the IAN directly contacting one or both of the roots of \nthe mandibular irst molar.53 It is highly recommended that \na comprehensive radiographic survey be completed to evalu-\nate the IAN in a vertical plane, especially with type 1 and 2 \nnerves (Fig. 9.22).\nThe Position of the IAN is Variable and Not Consistent in \nthe Buccal-Lingual Plane. Studies have shown the buccal-\nlingual location of the IAN as it progresses anteriorly is not \nconstant. The nerve paths have been described in a buccal-\nlingual direction with a high degree of variability and are \ndependent on the amount of bone resorption as well as age \nand race variables.54 Additionally, older and Caucasian patient \ngroups have shown less distance between the buccal aspect of \nthe nerve and the inferior border of the mandible.55 Other \nstudies have shown the most common area for the IAN to be \nin the middle of the buccal and lingual cortical plates is the \nirst molar region.56 Thus, in the buccal-lingual plane, three-\ndimensional cross-sectional images should be utilized to \ndetermine the true position of the nerve (Fig. 9.23).\nUnderstand the Variations of the Mental Foramen Loca-\ntion. Determining the exact location of the mental foramen \nis crucial when placing implants in the posterior mandible. \nAlthough the foramen has been shown to be symmetrical to \nthe contralateral side in most patients, the location has been \nshown to be highly variable.57 The mental nerve passes \nthrough the mental foramen with three nerve branches. One \ninnervates the skin of the mental area, and the other two \nproceed to innervate the skin of the lower lip, mucous \nmembranes, and the gingiva as far posteriorly as the second"

Clinically, there are many dif-\nferent techniques in identifying the foramen with a wide \nvariation of predictability.\nPalpation. In rare cases, the implant dentist may be able \nto palpate the location of the mental foramen. Most notably, \nwhen bone resorption has caused the nerve to be exposed on \nthe residual ridge, the concavity formed by the exposure of \nthe nerve can be determined. In these cases, the location \nof the mental foramen may be marked with a surgical pen. \nWhen the nerve is located on the buccal surface of the man-\ndible, the palpation method of identiication has very low \nutility (Fig. 9.24A).\nAnatomic landmarks. In the literature, many authors have \npostulated that landmarks such as teeth and mandibular \nbony areas may help identify the location of the mental \nforamen. With respect to teeth, the location cannot conclu-\nsively be associated with a particular tooth (e.g., irst premo-\nlar, second premolar, between apices of the premolars) \nbecause studies have shown the location to be dependent on \ngender, age, and race.58 Certain bony landmarks (e.g., alveolar \nridge, mandibular symphysis, infraorbital foramen) have \nbeen associated with a general location of the foramen, \nalthough these measurements are extremely variable and \ndependent on the extent of bone resorption, skeletal relation-\nships, and anatomic variants (Fig. 9.24B–C).\nTwo-dimensional radiographs.

Special care should be extended in \nthis situations because it may contain components of one of \nthe three branches of the mental nerve. Accessory foramina \nare believed to be the result of early branching of the inferior \nalveolar nerve, prior to exiting the mental foramen during the \n12th week of gestation.59 Double foramens are easily seen in \nthe 3-D or the coronal CBCT images (Fig. 9.25).\nEvaluate for Anterior Loops of the Mental Nerve. As the \nmental nerve proceeds anteriorly in the mandible, it some-\ntimes runs below the lower border and the anterior wall of \nthe mental foramen. This anterior and caudal component of \nthe mental nerve will curve cranially back to the mental \nforamen. This anterior and caudal part of the mental nerve \nis termed the anterior loop.59 Recently, studies have shown a \nhigher percentage (70%) prevalence of anterior loops with a \nmean of 1.16 mm distance anteriorly. The anterior loop may \nbe depicted most predictably on axial CBCT images, with 2-D \nradiographs being totally unreliable.\nDetermining the presence of an anterior loop is critical \nwhen placing implants anterior to the mental foramen. \nInability to ascertain the presence of an anterior loop may \nresult in damage to the mental nerve (Fig. 9.26). The anterior \nloop measurement should be added to the safe zone to avoid \ndamaging the mental nerve.\nDo Not Confuse the Incisive Nerve Branch as an Anterior \nLoop. The incisive nerve branch, a continuation and termi-\nnal branch of the IAN, supplies the mandibular canine and \nincisor teeth. Because there is no sensory innervation with \nthis nerve, implants may be placed in proximity to it without \nnerve impairment. Studies have shown incisive canals have a \nmean diameter of 1.8 mm and location 9.7 mm from the \nlower cortical border.60 The incisive nerve has been recog-\nnized as an important anatomic structure that must be taken \ninto consideration when performing surgery in this area.

Care \nshould always be exercised when performing osteotomies \nover vital structures, especially in the posterior mandible. The \nimplant clinician should double-check the marking depth on \nthe burs prior to initiating the osteotomy. The principle of \n“MEASURE TWICE, DRILL ONCE” should be followed to \nprevent iatrogenic overpreparation of the implant site. Addi-\ntionally, the “Y” dimension of the implant system being used \nmust be known. As noted earlier, the depth of the millimeter \nlines inscribed on surgical drills do not always coincide with \nthe actual depth of the drill. Most drills contain a V-shaped \napical portion designed for cutting eficiency (“Y” dimen-\nsion). Usually, the wider the drill, the greater the “Y” dimen-\nsion. The implant clinician should always evaluate the \nmanufacturer’s drill length with respect to the length of the \nimplant prior to performing the osteotomy. If this concept is \nnot adhered to, overpreparation of the site may occur, result-\ning in nerve damage (Fig. 9.29).\nUse Drill Stop Burs to Prevent Overpreparation. An addi-\ntional technique to prevent overpreparation of the osteotomy \nsite is the use of stop drills. These drills have a predetermined \ndepth marking that prevents overpreparation. Stop drills are \nvery beneicial in the mandibular posterior area, especially \nwhen visibility and access is compromised. Generic drill stop \nkits are also available that may be used with most implant \nsurgical systems (Salvin Dental Corp.).

A 2-mm safety zone \nwith osteotomy preparation and inal implant placement is \nparamount in preventing neurosensory impairments.41 \nCompression-related injuries (neuropraxia) can occur by \nencroaching on the IA nerve without actual contact. Nerve \nimpairments have been reported when implants are placed \nless than 2 mm from the canal without invasion of the canal. \nBleeding and resultant hematomas have been shown to cause \nnerve damage because of inal positioning too close to the \nneurovascular canal.62 Additionally, the IAN superior to cor-\ntical bone can be compressed, causing pressure necrosis with \nFIG 9.27 CBCT panoramic image depicting incisive branch \nof IAN (arrow). \nFIG 9.28 (A) Ideal placement >2.0 mm from nerve.

Additionally, some surgical implant \nsystems have speciic depth burs that coincide with the actual \nimplant depth (e.g., Hahn Implants, Glidewell Corp.).\nUnderstand Bony Crest Anatomy. Due to resultant bone \nresorption after extraction, the alveolar ridge becomes compro-\nmised in width (Division B bone) at the expense of the buccal \nplate. When measuring available bone height, special consider-\nation should be given to the inal location of the superior aspect \nof the implant platform, not the crest of the ridge. It will often \nappear that there is adequate vertical height for implant place-\nment; however, when the osteotomy is initiated, the thin crest \nwill be lost and the implant will be placed inferior to where it \nwas originally intended. This can lead to unexpected depth \ndrilling and an implant that is placed too close to the vital \nstructure. The clinician should either augment the ridge to \nmaintain vertical height or reduce the height calculation by the \namount of osteotomy induced osteoplasty (Fig. 9.31).\nMaintain Total Control of the Handpiece. When perform-\ning osteotomies in the posterior mandible, special care should \nbe noted to maintain complete control of the surgical hand-\npiece. Large marrow spaces (i.e., where there is a lack of or \nthin trabecular bone) are often present, which may allow the \nosteotomy site to become deeper than intended. This will \nresult in the implant being placed more apically, leading to \nneurosensory impairment. A MSCT or CBCT comprehensive \nevaluation allows the implant dentist to view the bone quality \nprior to surgery. Many third-party implant-planning pro-\ngrams allow the clinician to ascertain the density in the \nintended site. The implant clinician may also determine the \nbone density by tactile sensation when drilling. Additionally, \nwhen drilling the osteotomy near the mental foramen, care \nshould be exercised not to bend the wrist. This can potentially \nredirect the drill or implant placement in an unwanted direc-\ntion (e.g., near the mental foramen, into a tooth root). Surgi-\ncal templates and guides are beneicial in preventing this \nmalpositioning complication (Fig. 9.32).\nDo Not Place Bone Graft Material in Close Approximation \nto Nerve. After tooth extractions, especially in the mandibu-\nlar premolar areas, care should be exercised in placing bone \ngraft material (autologous, allogenic, xenogenic) in direct \ncontact with an exposed IAN. Whether socket grafting or in \nconjunction with implant placement, case studies have shown \nresultant neurosensory impairment from bone graft material \ncausing compression, crushing, or chemical burn injuries.64 \nWhen socket grafting in this area, excessive pressure should \nbe avoided.\nUse Copious Amounts of Irrigation.

The thickness of the \nnecrotic area is proportional to the amount of heat generated \nduring preparation.65 The implant dentist must be cautious \nto not overheat the bone. This can be minimized by “bone \ndancing,” which involves drilling in short intervals and allow-\ning irrigation to enter the osteotomy, preventing heat genera-\ntion. Additionally, new (sharp) and intermediate-sized drill \nburs may be used to reduce heat generation. This is more \ncrucial with harder bone density (e.g., D1 or D2) or bone \nwith compromised vascularity (Fig. 9.33).\nAvoid Incision-Related Injuries. There should be an aware-\nness when making incisions near the location of the mental \nforamen and associated nerve structures in the posterior \nmandible. In cases of severe bone atrophy, the presence of \nnerve dehiscence may inadvertently result in a transected \nnerve during the initial incision (i.e., making incision on the \ncrest of the ridge). Anatomic landmarks, 3-D models, accu-\nrate measurements from CBCT scan, or palpation of the \nnerves are ways to avoid this complication. Additionally, inci-\nsions in the posterior of the oral cavity should never be made \nover the retromolar pad. This can result in possible injury to \nthe lingual nerve, which in 10% of cases transects this area \n(Fig. 9.34).\nAvoid Flap/Retraction-Related Injuries. Neurosensory \nimpairments may also occur from overzealous use or incor-\nrect placement of retractors. Broad base (not sharp) retrac-\ntors should be used to retract tissue that is not directly over \nthe mental foramen because excessive stretching of the \nnerve trunk may cause irreversible damage. It is imperative \nthat the mental foramen and associated branches of the \nmental nerve be identiied in this area when placing retrac-\ntors. Retractors should always be placed and held on the \nbone to prevent slippage or excessive soft tissue pressure, \nwhich can lead to a neuropraxia type of nerve damage (Fig. \n9.35). Excessive stretching of the tissue may also lead to \nneurosensory impairments. It has been shown the perineu-\nrium protects the fascicles; however, if greater than 30% \nelongation of the nerve occurs, structural damage will occur \nto the nerve ibers.65a\nUse Special Care When Releasing Periosteum Over \nMental Foramen. It is a common procedure during closure \nafter implant placement or bone grafting to stretch the peri-\nosteal tissue to allow primary and “tension-free” closure. \nVarious techniques are used to “release” the tissue to improve \nvascularization of the incision line and adhesion of the \nmargins to prevent incision line opening. The submucosal \ntechnique developed by Misch in 1988 is an effective method \nto expand the tissue. This procedure involves the use of a #15 \nscalpel blade and soft tissue scissors (i.e., Metzenbaum) to \ncreate a blunt dissection. Knowledge of the location of the \nthree mental nerve branches is necessary because inadvertent \nincisions over the mental nerve branches may result in neu-\nrotmesis (transection) type of nerve injuries.\nA\nB\nFIG 9.30 (A) Drill Stop Kit.

When the mental nerve is exposed, care \nshould be exercised to prevent nerve tissue from being \nentrapped within the sutures. The mental nerve emerges from \nthe mental foramen and divides into three branches below the \ndepressor anguli oris muscle. Caution must be exercised to \nprevent any of the mental nerve branches from becoming \nentrapped within in the suture material, potentially causing a \nneuropraxia (compression) type of nerve injury. Additionally, \nnerve ibers may be damaged from the passage of the extremely \nsharp suture needle through the tissue (Fig. 9.36).\nVerify Correct Positioning of CBCT SurgiGuides. Studies \nhave shown that the most precise and accurate surgical tem-\nplates are tooth supported. When using bone- or tissue-\nsupported surgical guides, care must be exercised to correctly \nposition the guide because an error in placement may result \nin direct damage to the IA nerve. Tooth-supported guides \nshould always be the irst choice if possible because they are \nclinically proven to give rise to the fewest positioning errors. \nThe least accurate is the mucosa supported, which are most \nutilized for lapless surgery.66 Studies have shown that lapless \nsurgical guides consistently show deviations of implant \npositions from ideal locations. Perforations of the buccal \nplate can be found in over 50% of the lapless cases.67 A very \nminor discrepancy (anterioposterior) in the placement of the \nguide can lead to impingement on vital structures (Fig. 9.37). \nTherefore, surgical templates should always be ixated and \nideal position veriied.\nMiscellaneous Alternative Surgical Techniques\nAvoid Immediate Implants in the Mandibular Premolar \nArea. Immediate implants have gained overwhelming popu-\nlarity in implant dentistry today. Extreme caution must be \nexhibited when extracting and immediately placing implants \nin the mandibular premolar area. As noted, there are many \nvariables that dictate the position of the mental foramen, \nwith the foramen being highly variable. Studies have shown \nthat 25% to 38% of the time the mental foramen is superior \nto the premolars apex.58 Because most immediate implant \nosteotomy sites involve drilling the osteotomy site deeper for \nstability, chances of nerve trauma are greatly increased. \nBecause of this the implant clinician must be very selective in \ncases involving extraction and immediate implant placement \nin this anatomic area (Fig. 9.38)."

A 2-mm safety zone should always be \nadhered to because research has shown in approximately 28% \nof posterior mandibles, there is no superior cortical plate over \nthe inferior alveolar canal.68 Additionally, studies have shown \nit to be impossible to use tactile sense to ascertain the pres-\nence of superior cortical bone surrounding the mandibular \ncanal.58 Clinical reports have revealed hemorrhage into the \ncanal or bone fragments may cause compression or ischemia \nof the nerve from engaging the superior cortical plate. Depen-\ndence on the ability to “feel” the superior cortical plate \nthrough tactile sense increases the likelihood of nerve com-\nplications (Fig. 9.39).\nIniltration Technique. An alternative technique in placing \nimplants in the posterior mandible is not utilizing mandibu-\nlar nerve block anesthesia. Instead, iniltration is accom-\nplished in the soft tissue surrounding the osteotomy site, and \nthe patient is asked to alert the implant clinician on the prox-\nimity of the drill to the nerve bundle.69\nThis alternative technique results in a very high degree \nof subjectivity concerning patient’s responses due to varying \ndegrees of pain thresholds.

With \nthe success of CBCT radiography in implant dentistry today in \ndetermining the exact location of the inferior alveolar nerve, this \ntechnique should be avoided because of the high degree of false-\nnegative and false-positive results from patients. Etoz et al \nshowed this supraperiosteal iniltartion technique to be safe in \n91% of cases. However, this results in approximately one patient \nin ten ending up with a neurosensory deicit.70\n“Place Implants Buccal or Lingual to the IAN Canal or \nForamen.” Many authors have advocated placing implants \nbuccal or lingual to the neurovascular bundle. (Kumar; \nStellar) As stated previously, the buccal-lingual nerve position \nwithin the mandible is extremely variable along with the inci-\ndence and trajectory of lingual osseous concavities. Attempt-\ning to place implants buccal or lingual to the inferior alveolar \ncanal or mental foramen is associated with a high degree of \nmorbidity, even with the use of CBCT-guided surgery. Addi-\ntionally, perforation of the cortical plate can occur, which \nmay lead to sublingual bleeding or formation of a sublingual \nhematoma (Fig. 9.40).\n“Place Implants at the Depth of the Adjacent Root \nApexes.” Many implant clinicians use the location and \nlength of the adjacent teeth as a guide in determining the size \n(length) implant to be placed. Usually a panorex or periapical \nradiograph is utilized in determination of this length. When \nthis technique is used in anatomic type 2 or 3 (i.e., more api-\ncally positioned in the vertical dimension) nerve courses, \nincidence of nerve impairment is low. However, in mandibles \nthat exhibit a type 1 nerve course (close to root apex), close \napproximation of the implant to the canal is likely leading to \na higher probability of neurosensory impairment. Ideally, the \nimplant clinician should ascertain the available bone above \nthe mandibular canal via three-dimensional radiographic \nanalysis (Fig. 9.41).\n“As Long as There Is Not Excessive Bleeding, the Man-\ndibular Canal Has Not Been Violated.” Another uncon-\nventional technique in avoiding nerve impairment is the \nevaluation of the amount of bleeding from the osteotomy \nsite. Many practitioners correlate the amount of hemorrhage \nwith the proximity of the neurovascular bundle (inferior \nalveolar nerve, artery, vein, and lymphatic vessels). Anatomic"

(C) Although variations exist, multiple smaller veins (blue) \nare usually present superior to the polyfascicular inferior alveolar nerve (brown) with the inferior \nalveolar artery (red) superiorly and lingually positioned. \nA\nB\nC\nB\nL\nFIG 9.43 (A–B) Because of the curvature of the mandible in \nthe ramus area, the mandibular canal is in close approximation \nto the second molar tooth roots in all types of nerve courses. \nA\nB\nstudies have shown the inferior alveolar artery may lie parallel \nto the nerve and lingual as it traverses anteriorly. Its position \nvaries with respect to the inferior alveolar nerve within the \nmandibular canal. Other studies show the inferior alveolar \nartery appears to be solitary and lies superior and lingual to \nthe inferior alveolar nerve, slightly above the horizontal posi-\ntion.12 Additionally, there exists multiple inferior alveolar \nveins positioned superior to the nerve, which may cause \nvenous oozing if directly traumatized.11 A false positive may \noccur if this area is damaged as large marrow spaces, which \ncan cause excessive bleeding, are common in the posterior \nmandible (D4 bone). The degree of bleeding should not be \nused as an indication of nerve proximity or violation of the \nmandibular canal (Fig. 9.42).\n“Replacing Second Molars.” There are many prosthetic \nand surgical disadvantages when evaluating edentulous \nsecond mandibular molar sites for implant placement. Dis-\nadvantages include high incidence of sublingual bony under-\ncuts, which can result in perforation of the lingual plate or \nangulation issues, decreased interocclusal space (especially \nwith supraeruption of the adjacent tooth), dificult access for \nsurgery and prosthetic component insertion, and the fact \nthere is 10% greater occlusal force on the second molar vs. \nthe irst molar. Function is not a primary reason for replace-\nment because 90% of masticatory eficiency is generated \nanterior to the mesial half of the mandibular irst molar, and \ncheek biting is more common in this area because of the \nproximity of the buccinators muscle. One of the most impor-\ntant disadvantages is the close approximation of the man-\ndibular canal in the second molar area, which leads to \ndificulty in placement of implants in this area. When implants \nare placed, usually the available bone present is compromised \nin height. As a result, the second molar is often not replaced \nwhen the only posterior teeth missing are the second and \nthird molars. The primary disadvantage of not replacing the \nsecond molar is extrusion of the opposing maxillary second \nmolar. If extrusion is a signiicant concern, a full-coverage \ncrown on the mandibular irst molar may include an occlusal \ncontact on with the mesial marginal ridge of the maxillary \nsecond molar (Fig. 9.43)."

Patients who exhibit compromised \nalveolar crest height in the posterior mandibular area can be \nvery challenging. Techniques include the use of shorter \nimplants, which become biomechanically compromised, or \nthe use of bone grafting to increase available bone for future \nimplant placement. An alternative technique is to reposition \nthe inferior alveolar nerve laterally, either by nerve lateraliza-\ntion or nerve transposition. In nerve lateralization, the infe-\nrior alveolar nerve is exposed and retracted laterally while the \ndental implants are placed. The transposition technique, irst \npublished in 1987 by Jenson and Nock, includes the mental \nforamen in the osteotomy resulting in the inferior alveolar \nnerve being positioned more posterior.71 The inherent risk \nwith these complex procedures is neurosensory impairment \n(anesthesia, paresthesia, or dysesthesia) to the mental nerve \nbranch. Although this is a valid treatment option in signii-\ncantly atrophied cases, this technique should be reserved for \npractitioners with advanced training and experience with \nthese procedures (Fig. 9.44).\nSUMMARY\nIn implant dentistry today, one of the most serious complica-\ntions is neurosensory impairment associated with implant \nplacement or bone grafting. To avoid nerve damage a thor-\nough understanding of the radiographic anatomy is para-\nmount. If nerve impairment does occur, quick recognition \nand treatment is crucial to decreasing long-term morbidity. \nThe nerves associated with the maxilla and mandible \nare associated with inconsistent anatomic locations. The \nimplant clinician should understand the limitations of two-\ndimensional radiology and the importance of a comprehen-\nsive radiographic evaluation of the neural anatomy of the \nmaxilla and mandible. Additionally, the clinician must under-\nstand the complications that may arise from unconventional \nsurgical techniques that may increase the morbidity of the \nprocedure."

Resnik\n10 \nDental implant surgery comprises many diverse procedures \nthat are considered in dentistry to be relatively safe with a \nhigh success rate. However, implant clinicians must be \naware and take into consideration numerous postoperative \ncomplications that may follow dental implant surgery. \nMost postoperative complications resolve with minimal \nintervention, but some situations may predispose implants to \nfailure or even subject the patient to life-threatening situa-\ntions. Understanding the possibility and magnitude of post-\noperative complications is crucial for today’s clinicians \npracticing implant dentistry. In this chapter a wide range of \npostoperative complications will be discussed according to \nthe etiology, prevention, and management to decrease implant \nand patient morbidity.\nMEDICAL ISSUES\nEDEMA (POSTOPERATIVE)  \nSURGICAL SWELLING\nPostoperative edema is a direct result of tissue injury and is \ndeined as an accumulation of luid in the interstitial tissue. \nTwo variables determine the extent of edema: (1) the amount \nof tissue injury is proportional to the amount of edema; \n(2) the more loose the connective tissue at the surgery site, \nthe more edema is most likely to be present.1 Because \npostoperative swelling can adversely affect the incision line \n(i.e., result in incision line opening), measures should be \ntaken to minimize this condition. Usually, edema will peak at \napproximately 48–72 hours, therefore patients should always \nbe informed. Increased swelling after the fourth day may be \nan indication of infection, rather than postsurgical edema.\nEtiology\nThe mediators of the inlammatory process include cyclooxy-\ngenase and prostaglandins, which play a signiicant role in the \ndevelopment of postoperative inlammation and pain. When \ntissue manipulation or damage occurs, phospholipids are \nconverted into arachidonic acid by way of phospholipase A2. \nArachidonic acid, which is an amino acid, is released into the \ntissue, which produces prostaglandins via enzymatic break-\ndown via cyclooxygenases. The end result is the formation of \nleukotrienes, prostacyclins, prostaglandins, and thromboxane \nA2, which are the mediators for inlammation and pain.\nPrevention\nTo minimize postoperative swelling, good surgical technique \nmust be used with minimal tissue trauma. Additional factors \ninclude patient systemic disorders, excessive retraction, and \nlong surgical duration, which will all contribute to increased \ninlammation after surgery. Postoperative prophylactic medi-\ncations such as ibuprofen (nonsteroidal antiinlammatory \ndrugs [NSAIDs]) and glucocorticosteroids (steroids) are uti-\nlized as prophylactic medications, which counteract the nega-\ntive effects of the edema cascade (Fig. 10.1).\nNonsteroidal Antiinlammatory Drugs. NSAIDs have an \nanalgesic effect as well as an antiinlammatory effect. This \ndrug class reduces inlammation by inhibiting the synthesis \nof prostaglandins from arachidonic acid. Therefore the use \nof the popular analgesic drug ibuprofen has a secondary \nbeneicial antiinlammatory effect. NSAIDs do not have a \nceiling effect for inlammation (i.e., ceiling effect for analgesia \nis 400 mg); however, higher doses to achieve antiinlamma-\ntory qualities are accompanied by serious side effects.\nRecommendation: Ibuprofen 400 mg for Type 1–4 proce-\ndures (see Misch Prophylactic Medication Protocol, Table 10.1).\nGlucocorticosteroids. The adrenal cortex, which uses choles-\nterol as a substrate, synthesizes and secretes two types of steroid \nhormones—the androgens and corticosteroids. The corticoster-\noids are classiied additionally by their major actions: (1) glu-\ncocorticoids, which have effects on carbohydrate metabolism \nand have potent antiinlammatory actions, and (2) mineralo-\ncorticoids, which have sodium-retaining qualities. The use of \nsynthetic glucocorticosteroids has become very popular in the \npostoperative management of inlammation after oral surgical \nprocedures. These synthetic glucocorticoids have greater anti-\ninlammatory potency in comparison to natural steroids with \nvery little sodium and water retention. Most steroids have \nsimilar chemical structures; however, they differ in their mil-\nligram potency.2 The antiinlammatory effects are achieved by \naltering the connective tissue response to injury, causing a \ndecrease in hyperemia, which results in less exudation and cel-\nlular migration along with iniltration at the site of injury.3\nGlucocorticoids bind to glucocorticoid receptors within \ncells and form a glucocorticoid-GR complex. This complex \nalters the synthesis of mRNA from the DNA molecule, affect-\ning the production of different proteins. By suppressing the \nproduction of proteins that are involved in inlammation,"

Special attention must be given to diabetic \npatients because glucocorticoids have an antiinsulin action that \nresults in increased serum glucose and glycosuria.6 Usually, \ncorticosteroids are contraindicated with insulin dependent \ndiabetics. For oral and diet controlled diabetics, a medical \nconsult should be completed prior to any treatment.\nRecommendation: Decadron 4 mg for Type 1–4 procedures \n(see Table 10.1, Misch Prophylactic Medication Protocol).\nCryotherapy. Cryotherapy (application of ice) is one of the \nsimplest and most economical modalities in the management \nof postoperative soft tissue inlammation. The use of ice to \nreduce pain and swelling dates back to the ancient Egyptians, \nover 4000 years ago.7\nThe use of cryotherapy is highly advised in any dental \nimplant procedure in which excessive inlammation is expected. \nThe mechanism of action involves a reduction in luid accumu-\nlation within the body tissues, slowing of metabolism, control \nof hemorrhage, and a decrease in the excitability of peripheral \nnerve ibers leading to an increase in pain threshold.8\nCaution must be taken to limit the application of ice to no \nlonger than 2 days because prolonged use may cause rebound \nswelling and cell destruction. Improper and prolonged use of \nice may result in cell death due to prolonged vasoconstriction, \nischemia, and capillary thrombosis.9\nAfter 2 to 3 days, moist heat may be applied to the region to \nincrease blood and lymph low to help clear the area of the inlam-\nmatory consequences. This also helps reduce any ecchymosis that \nmay have occurred from the tissue relection. Although usually \nsafe, the application of ice is cautioned in patients suffering from \ncold hypersensitivities and intolerances and peripheral vascular \ndiseases. Additionally, ice application may be problematic in \npatients who are elderly or very young because they may have \nimpaired thermal regulation and limited ability to communicate. \nCare should be exercised in using facial bandages because pro-\nlonged ice administration may result in soft tissue injury.\nRecommendation: Cold dressings (ice packs) should be \napplied extraorally (not directly on skin: place a layer of dry \ncloth between ice and skin) over the surgical site for 20 minutes \non/20 minutes off for the irst 24–36 hours (Fig. 10.2).\nDecrease Activities. Patients should be instructed to decrease \nactivities after surgery because this will minimize swelling post-\noperatively. The more active the patient and the more strenuous \nactivity the patient engages in, the greater the extraoral swelling.\nRecommendation: Activities should be limited for the irst \n3 days. Elevation of the head (sitting upright) and sleeping on \nmultiple pillows will minimize the postoperative swelling.\nTreatment\nSwelling is self-limiting and, once it occurs, it is usually dif-\nicult to treat (time-dependent). The above mentioned \nmedications/therapy (Decadron, NSAIDs, cryotherapy) will \nhelp to reduce postoperative inlammation.\nglucocorticoids also activate lipocortins, which have been \nshown to inhibit the action of phospholipase A2 (PLA2). \nPLA2 is a key enzyme involved in the release of arachidonic \nacid from cell membranes.\nArachidonic acid is an omega-6 fatty acid that is incorporated \ninto cell membranes. When a cell is damaged, arachidonic acid \nis released from cell membranes and is converted into inlam-\nmatory and pain prostaglandins by cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 \nenzymes. The release of arachidonic acid requires the activation \nof enzyme PLA2. However, lipocortins, which cause the inhibi-\ntion of PLA2, prevent the release of arachidonic acid, thereby \nreducing the amounts of inlammatory prostaglandins.\nThere is a wide range of glucocorticoid preparations avail-\nable for local, oral, and parenteral administration. In relation \nto the naturally occurring cortisol (hydrocortisone), syn-\nthetic glucocorticoids are longer acting and more potent. The \nmain differences are based on the classiication as short acting \n(<12 hours), intermediate acting (12–36 hours), and long \nacting (>36 hours). A summary of the most common gluco-\ncorticosteroids is shown in Table 10.2.\nThe ideal synthetic glucocorticoid for dental implant surgery \nshould maintain high antiinlammatory potency with minimal \nmineralocorticoid effects. The glucocorticoid that best suits the \nrequirements is the long-acting glucocorticoid dexamethasone \n(Decadron). It is imperative this drug be administered before \nsurgery so that adequate blood levels are obtained. Also, it \nshould be given in the morning in conjunction with the natural \nrelease of cortisol (~8:00 am). This timing will interfere the \nleast with the adrenocortical system. Because inlammation \nusually peaks between 48 and 72 hours, the postoperative \nregimen of dexamethasone should not exceed 3 days after \nsurgery. This high-dose, short-term glucocorticoid therapy \nhas been shown not to signiicantly affect the hypothalamic–\npituitary–adrenal axis (HPA axis), which controls many of the \nbodies processes, including reactions to stress.4\nA signiicant additional beneit of the administration of \ndexamethasone is the potent antiemetic effects for the prophy-\nlactic treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting. This is \nnow an accepted medication for hospital-based outpatient \nsurgery, usually given in doses of 8–10 mg intravenously.5\nFIG 10.1 Mechanism of action for nonsteroidal antiinlamma-\ntory drugs (NSAIDs) and steroids in the reduction of inlamma-\ntion.

Bite blocks, short duration treatment, and sedation \nmay decrease the possibility of trismus complications. When \nusing CBCT surgiguides, lateral access openings should be \nutilized in the guide to prevent extensive opening to accom-\nmodate the guide and surgical bur. This mainly occurs in the \nposterior region of the oral cavity.\nTreatment\nUsually trismus will resolve with time; however, patients \nshould maintain a soft diet and minimize overactivity. Addi-\ntional treatment includes the use of physical therapy, passive \nrange of motion exercises, splint therapy, and medications \nsuch as NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, and steroids (Medrol \nDosepak, Decadron).\nPOSTSURGICAL PAIN\nPain has been documented to be inadequately treated in 50% of \nall surgical procedures.10 Oral surgical studies have shown pain \nimplant surgery, especially after longer, more invasive surger-\nies.

Bilirubin > hemosiderin = golden-brown color\nEcchymosis may appear as bright red, black, blue, purple, \nor a combination of the above colors. It usually consists of \nnonelevated, rounded, and irregular areas that increase in \nintensity over 3–4 days postoperation and will diminish and \nbecome yellow as they disappear. It may take 2–3 weeks for \ncomplete resolution.\nPrevention\nUnfortunately, even with gentle handling of tissues and good \nsurgical technique, ecchymosis may be unavoidable. To mini-\nmize ecchymosis, avoid postoperative aspirin, herbal remedies, \nand food supplements that may increase bleeding. Always \ninform the patient preoperatively (preferably in written post-\noperation instructions) that bruising may occur. Elderly \npatients are more susceptible to ecchymosis because of \ndecreased tissue tone and weaker intracellular attachment.\nTreatment\nEcchymosis is self-limiting and usually resolves without treat-\nment. However, the patient may treat the ecchymosis in the \nfollowing ways:\nRest/avoid strenuous activity: promotes tissue healing and \ndecreases inlammation.\nElevation: helps decrease inlammation, facilitates proper \nvenous return, and improves circulation to the site.\nAnalgesics: helps reduce pain associated with the onset of \necchymosis.\nSun exposure: inform patient to avoid sun exposure to \nthe area of bruising as excessive sunlight may cause perma-\nnent discoloration.\nTRISMUS\nTrismus refers to reduced opening of the jaws, which is caused \nby trauma or spasm to the muscles of mastication. The \nlimited opening may result in an interference with eating, \nspeech, and hygiene and may cause pain.\nEtiology\nTrismus after implant surgery can be due to multiple factors. \nThe most likely etiologic factor is local anesthetic, secondary \nto an inferior alveolar nerve block that penetrates the medial \npterygoid muscle. Also, complicated or prolonged surgical \nprocedures that require full-thickness mucoperiosteal laps \nwith resultant edema can lead to trismus. Normal interincisal \nopening is approximately 35–45 mm, with mild trismus \nbeing classiied as 20–30 mm and severe trismus less than \n10 mm (Fig. 10.4).1\nFIG 10.4 Trismus.

Surgery duration not to exceed patient’s tolerance\n3. Postoperative long-acting anesthetics\n4. Adequate postoperative pain control and instructions\n5. Limitation of patient activities post-operatively.\nTreatment\nThe implant clinician must understand the various aspects of \npain control after dental implant surgery. In most cases: (1) \npain is not severe and mild OTC analgesics can manage the \ndiscomfort, (2) peak pain occurs approximately 12 hours after \nsurgery and diminishes over time, and (3) pain will persist no \nlonger than 2 days. However, this is patient speciic.1\nThe most important principle with pain management \nafter implant surgery is the timing of the medication. Ideally, \nanalgesic medications should be taken before the effects of \nthe local anesthetic subside. With this approach postoperative \npain is easier to control, and the patient is less likely to experi-\nence the acute, severe pain. If the patient takes medication \nafter pain is present, the patient will inevitably have to \ntake more medication to control the pain, increasing the \nlikelihood of analgesic side effects.\nIn implant dentistry, different classiications and mecha-\nnisms of pain suppression may be used. A pain control pro-\ntocol has been established that simpliies and standardizes the \nvarious aspects of pain relief (Table 10.3):\n1. Nonopioid analgesics (nonnarcotics)\n2. Opioid analgesics (narcotics)\n3. Adjuvants\nNonopioid Medications. The nonopioid analgesics used in \nimplant dentistry include acetaminophen, NSAIDs, COX-2 \ninhibitors, and tramadol.\nAcetaminophen. The mode of action of acetaminophen \nis not known; however, it is believed to involve the prosta-\nglandin pathways within the central nervous system with \nin the oral cavity to reach its maximum intensity within the irst \n12 hours after surgery, and 97% of patients reporting postopera-\ntive pain being the greatest during the irst day of surgery.11\nPostsurgical painful experiences predispose the patient to \nampliication of noxious stimuli (hyperalgesia) and cause \ntypically painless sensations to be experienced as pain (allo-\ndynia). Patients who have had painful experiences (surgery) \nmay have increased pain and the need for additional analgesic \nuse in future surgeries. The goal for pain control in oral \nimplantology is to have adequate analgesic levels before the \ncessation of local anesthesia and a well-administrated post-\noperative analgesic regimen for patient comfort.\nEtiology\nThe mechanism of painful stimuli is modulated by the \nperipheral and central nervous systems. Noxious stimuli (e.g., \ntissue damage or bone preparation) cause peripheral noci-\nceptors to transmit signals along nerve ibers lying in the \ndorsal root ganglion. Their axons synapse in the dorsal horn \nof the spinal cord and then travel along the spinothalamic \ntract of the spinal cord to the thalamus and the cortex. Within \nthe cortex and thalamus, signals originating from tissue \ndamage form the subjective interpretation of pain.\nWith repeated noxious stimuli, peripheral nociceptors \nbecome more responsive. The sensitivity to these receptors is \nfurther enhanced by tissue factors and inlammatory media-\ntors released in the course of tissue damage. Numerous inlam-\nmatory mediators are present, including prostaglandins, kinins, \nleukotrienes, substance P, and histamine. These mediators ini-\ntiate and magnify the nociceptive impulses that are transmitted \nto the central nervous system for the perception of pain.\nThe most important mediators, prostaglandins, are \nextremely important in sensitizing peripheral neurons to the \nlocal stimuli. Prostaglandins are also synthesized in the spinal \ncord and brain and enhance pain sensitivity by recruiting \nsecondary neurons to respond to the primary stimulus.12\nOne of most commonly used analgesics, NSAIDs, work at \nthe site of tissue damage, preventing prostaglandin formation \nby inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX). COX is an enzyme that \nbreaks down arachidonic acid for prostaglandin synthesis. In the \ntissue there are two well-identiied cyclooxygenases, COX-1 and \nCOX-2. COX-1 enzymes support hemostasis (platelet degranu-\nlation and adhesion), stomach mucosal integrity, and regulation \nof kidney function. COX-2 enzymes are an inducible form \nwhose synthesis is activated in damaged tissue, which leads to \nthe formation of proinlammatory prostaglandins that play a \nmajor role in inlammation, pain, and fever. A relatively new \nCOX has been described (COX-3) that is found in the brain and \nis thought to be the site of action of acetaminophen.13\nIn contrast to NSAIDs, opioids have a different mecha-\nnism of action to reduce pain. Opioids act on the central \nnervous system by binding to speciic receptors (m-opioid), \nthus preventing transmission of nociceptive pathways while \nalso activating inhibitory pathways that descend to the spinal \ncord. By binding to these m-opioid receptors, substance P is \nprevented from being released, thus preventing painful \nstimuli (Fig. 10.5).14\nFIG 10.5 Pain cascade depicting the breakdown of arachi-\ndonic acid into the various forms of prostaglandins. \nTissue damage\nGI cytoprotection\nPlatelet activity\nProstaglandins\nProstaglandins\nCox-1\nCox-2\n(Cox-3??)\nAcetaminophen??\nNSAIDs\nCox-2\ninhibitors\nArachidonic acid\nPain\nInflammation\nFever"

COX-3 \nenzymes have been described as being fully expressed in the \nbrain, spinal cord, and heart. The primary function is to regu-\nlate pain responses and fever, and COX-3 has been postulated \nto be the site of action of acetaminophen.15\nAcetaminophen is indicated for mild to moderate pain and \nas a safe alternative to NSAIDs. It has excellent analgesic and \nantipyretic properties and is void of side effects that are associ-\nated with NSAIDs. Like NSAIDs, acetaminophen also has a \nceiling dose (4 g/day) for analgesic effects. However, unlike \nNSAIDs, acetaminophen has the drawback of having minimal \nantiinlammatory qualities. The main side effect of acetamino-\nphen is liver damage, which is associated with excessive and \nlong-term use of this drug.\nNonsteroidal antiinlammatory drugs. The NSAIDs are \none of the most commonly used analgesic families in implant \ndentistry today. Clinical trials have shown that NSAIDs are \neffective in all levels of pain (mild, moderate, severe).16 \nThe mechanism of action of NSAIDs is thought to arise \nfrom the inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins from \narachidonic acid. With the inhibition of COX, conversion of \narachidonic acid to the immediate precursors of prostaglan-\ndins is prevented. Thus, with the lack of prostaglandins in the \ntissue, the hyperanalgesia and edema associated with acute \ninlammation is minimized.17\nThe main reasons that NSAIDs are so widely used is the \nfact that they work very well as analgesics and have variable \neffects on inlammation (drug and dose dependent). Inlam-\nmation and pain are two separate entities, with analgesic \ndoses having a ceiling effect18 and antiinlammatory doses not \nhaving a ceiling effect. In regards to the analgesic effect, there \nis no reason to exceed the analgesic ceiling for the treatment \nof acute pain because higher doses give no additional pain \nrelief while increasing the likelihood of side effects.\nThe side effects of NSAIDs are numerous, including \ngastrointestinal (GI) disturbances (dyspepsia, erosions, ulcer-\nations) and liver, renal, and cardiac effects.19 This group of \nmedications is responsible for the largest number of serious \nFrom Misch CE: Contemporary implant dentistry, ed 3, St Louis, 2008, Mosby.\nTABLE 10.3 Analgesic Agents Used to Control Postoperative Surgical Pain\nAnalgesic\nBrand Name\nOnset (hr)\nPeak \n(hr)\nDuration (hr)\nRecommended \nDose\nDosing \nInterval (h)\nMaximum \nDose/Day\nNonopioid\nAcetaminophen\nTylenol\n0.5\n0.5–2\n4–6\n650–1000 mg\n4–6\n4000 mg\nIbuprofen\nMotrin\nAdvil\n0.5\n1–2\n4–6\n400 mg\n4–6\n2400 mg\nNaproxen\nAnaprox\n1\n2–4\n5–7\n275–550 mg\n6–8\n1375 mg\nTramadol\nUltram\n0.5\n1–2\n4–6\n50–100 mg\n4–6\n400 mg\nOpioid\nCodeine\nTylenol with codeine\n0.1–0.3\n0.5–1\n4–6\n60 mg\n3–4\nHydrocodone\nDicodid\n0.25–0.5\n0.5\n4–8\n5–10 mg\n4–6\nOxycodone\nPercocet\n0.25–0.5\n1\n4–6\n5–10 mg\n4–6\nMeperidine\nDemerol\n0.1–0.45\n0.5–1\n2–4\n50–100 mg\n6\nPropoxyphene\nDarvon\n0.5–1\n2–2.5\n4–6\n65–130 mg\n4–6\ndrug-related complications, surpassing all other drugs by a \nwide margin.20 In 2005 GI-related deaths from NSAIDs were \nthe 14th leading cause of death in the United States, ranked \nafter homicides (13th) and before atherosclerosis (15th).21\nNSAIDs have very little effect on platelet aggregation \nbecause bleeding times are not prolonged. With prolonged \nuse of NSAIDs, interference with most classes of antihyper-\ntensives has been noted. If patients take NSAIDs for more \nthan 5 days postoperatively, blood pressure should be \nmonitored.\nIbuprofen. Ibuprofen was irst introduced in 1969 as a \nnew NSAID and has since been the most popular prescribed \nNSAID. Ibuprofen is used to treat mild to moderate pain and \nhas been proven to signiicantly reduce postoperative dental \npain in clinical studies. The analgesic ceiling dose is 400 mg/\ndose and 1200 mg/day.22 At these doses it has been shown to \nbe as safe as acetaminophen, while achieving better analgesia \nwith less nausea and cramping.\nAspirin. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) was the irst proto-\ntypical NSAID. It has analgesic, antiinlammatory, and anti-\npyretic properties. However, at analgesic doses its relative \nrisk for GI complications is high. Acetylsalicylic acid is \nnot a drug of choice in the management of dental implant \nsurgical patients because of its very signiicant antiplatelet \neffects.\nTramadol. Tramadol represents a unique classiication of \nanalgesic because it is a centrally acting analgesic with two \ncomplementary characteristics: opioid and antidepressant. It \nworks by inhibition of norepinephrine and serotonin reup-\ntake within pain pathways of the central nervous system and \nalso by its relatively weak afinity for the m-opioid receptor. \nTramadol is a nonscheduled drug and is associated with fewer \nopioid-like side effects, such as dependence, sedation, respira-\ntory depression, and constipation. Tramadol’s analgesic efi-\ncacy is similar to that of codeine (60 mg) and is indicated for \nmoderate to moderately severe pain management. This drug \nis an appropriate analgesic alternative for the treatment of \npostoperative pain in patients who have NSAID-related GI"

Hydrocodone bitartrate is a semisynthetic \nnarcotic analgesic and antitussive with multiple actions qualita-\ntively similar to codeine. It is usually used as a combination \nanalgesic, being combined with either acetaminophen or ibu-\nprofen. For several years, this narcotic has been the most fre-\nquently dispensed prescription medication in the United States. \nHydrocodone is habit forming, and the most frequent adverse \nreactions are dizziness, sedation, nausea, and vomiting.\nOxycodone. Oxycodone is a semisynthetic opioid with \nanalgesic action similar to morphine. It is recommended for \nmoderate to severe pain with its principal actions being anal-\ngesia and sedation. It has excellent oral bioavailability because \nit retains half of its analgesic activity when administered \norally. Oxycodone has the same adverse effects as most other \nopioids, with an increased potential for abuse and drug \ndependence. Oxycodone is marketed as a combination nar-\ncotic, combined with either acetaminophen (Percocet) or \naspirin (Percodan). A slow-release oxycodone (OxyContin) \nhas been shown to have a high abuse potential.\nCombination Analgesic Therapy for Postoperative Pain. \nA pain management strategy using multiple analgesics with \ndifferent mechanisms of action is termed combination anal-\ngesic therapy. The goal of combining different types of anal-\ngesics is to increase the analgesic effect while decreasing \npossible side effects. When multiple drugs are used in com-\nbination, synergistic and additive effects allow for the use of \nlower doses of each individual drug (Table 10.4).\nWith combination therapy, acetaminophen or NSAIDs are \nused with an opioid. Because of the ceiling effects of acetamino-\nphen and NSAIDs, further increases in dosage will not provide \nany additional analgesia; however, they will increase side effects.\nAnalgesic Agents in Oral Implantology. The selection of an \nanalgesic or analgesic regimen for management of postsurgical \nand opioid intolerance. Tramadol has been shown to be effec-\ntive in the reduction of pain when used in combination with \nacetaminophen. Ultracet (tramadol/acetaminophen) has \ndemonstrated excellent eficacy in pain studies and is sup-\nplied as a combination analgesic containing 37.5 mg trama-\ndol and 325 mg acetaminophen.23\nNarcotics (Opioids). Narcotics (opioids) are the primary \nmedications for analgesia of moderate to severe pain from \ndental origin. They are centrally acting analgesics that act as \nagonists at µ- and κ-opioid receptors. Morphine, which is a \nnaturally occurring opioid, is generally accepted as the pro-\ntotypical narcotic. All other narcotics on the market today are \ncompared in potency to morphine.\nUnlike nonopioids, opioids do not have a ceiling effect for \nanalgesia. As the dose increases, the analgesic effect increases. \nHowever, in addition to relieving pain by m-receptor binding, \neuphoria, nausea, vomiting, and constipation may occur. \nWith high doses, sedation and respiratory depression are pos-\nsible. With chronic use, physical and psychologic dependence \nare common.\nThe following section discusses the most commonly used \nnarcotics in oral implantology. Structurally, these narcotics \nare similar to morphine and provide the same degree of pain \nrelief and unlimited eficacy at equipotent doses.\nCodeine. Codeine is a naturally occurring alkaloid that is \nclassiied as a mild analgesic. Codeine has excellent antitus-\nsive properties; however, it is associated with high degrees of \nnausea and constipation. Orally administered codeine is only \n60% bioavailable, which results in only 10% being demethyl-\nated to morphine. This 10% is the only part responsible for \nanalgesic properties, thus 90% or the drug has no analgesic \neficacy. Because of the side effects and low potency compared \nwith other opioids, codeine is usually not the irst choice of \nnarcotics used in oral implantology.\nFrom Misch CE: Contemporary implant dentistry, ed 3, St Louis, 2008, Mosby.\nTABLE 10.4 Combination Analgesics\nGeneric Name\nBrand Name\nAverage Adult Dose\nSchedule\n5 mg codeine/300 mg acetaminophen\nTylenol #1\n1–2 tablets every 4 h\nIII\n15 mg codeine/300 mg acetaminophen\nTylenol #2\n1–2 tablets every 4 h\nIII\n30 mg codeine/300 mg acetaminophen\nTylenol #3\n1–2 tablets every 4 h\nIII\n60 mg codeine/300 mg acetaminophen\nTylenol #4\n1 tablet every 4 h\nIII\n5 mg hydrocodone/500 mg acetaminophen\nVicodin/Lortab 5/500\n1–2 tablets every 4–6 h (maximum  \n8 tablets/24 h)\nIII\n7.5 mg hydrocodone/750 mg acetaminophen\nVicodin ES\n1 tablet every 4–6 h\nIII\n7.5 mg hydrocodone/650 mg acetaminophen\nLorcet\n1 tablet every 4–6 h\nIII\n10 mg hydrocodone/660 mg acetaminophen\nVicodin\n1 tablet every 4–6 h\nIII\n10 mg hydrocodone/650 mg acetaminophen\nLorcet 10/650\n1 tablet every 4–6 h\nIII\n7.5 mg hydrocodone/200 mg ibuprofen\nVicoprofen\n1–2 tablets every 6 h\nIII\n5 mg oxycodone/325 mg acetaminophen\nPercocet 5/325\n1 tablet every 4–6 h\nII\n7.5 mg oxycodone/500 mg acetaminophen\nPercocet 7.5/500\n1 tablet every 4–6 h/maximum 8/day\nII\n10 mg oxycodone/650 mg acetaminophen\nPercocet 10/650\n1 tablet every 4–6 h\nII\n5 mg oxycodone/400 mg ibuprofen\nCombunox\n1 tablet every 6 h/maximum 4/day\nII"

The \nixed dose of opioids with the NSAIDs provides additive anal-\ngesia. Glucocorticoids and cryotherapy are encouraged.\n3. Moderate to severe pain that is expected or persists should \nbe treated by increasing the dosage of the opioid. Gluco-\ncorticoids and cryotherapy are of particular beneit when \nnot contraindicated.\nWith the guidelines from the World Health Organization, a \npain control protocol was formulated for treatment of pro-\ncedures based on the expected postoperative pain (Box 10.1).\nTREATING EACH PATIENT/PROCEDURE  \nTHE SAME PHARMACOLOGICALLY\nComplication\nMany clinicians treat all dental implant patients with the \nsame prophylactic protocol, irrespective of the patient’s ASA \nclassiication and type of procedure. For example, a sinus \nbone graft has much higher morbidity than a single tooth \nimplant, therefore, a different pharmacologic protocol is indi-\ncated. The complications and morbidity of the surgical pro-\ncedure are proportional and directly related to the medical \nstatus of the patient, surgical procedure, length of surgery, \nand the extent of tissue relection. The authors have devel-\noped a pharmacologic approach that recommends different \nprotocols based the factors mentioned (see Table 10.2).\nPrevention\nClinicians should have a clear understanding of all prophylac-\ntic medications (antibiotics, antiinlammatories, analgesics) \nthat are indicated to minimize postoperative complications \nand decrease morbidity. Additionally, the implant clinician \nmust be aware of all drug interactions and contraindications \nto the use of these agents.\nTreatment\nBecause of the many variables (e.g., local, systemic, surgical) \nthat need to be considered with the use of pharmacologic \nagents in implant dentistry, a protocol has been developed to \nstandardize the prophylactic use of these agents. A four-\ncategory pharmacologic classiication is proposed based on \nthe patient’s ASA status, type of surgical procedure, and inva-\nsiveness of the surgery (see Table 10.2).\nTABLE 10.5 Recommended Pain \nControl Protocol (PCP)\nDrug\nDose\nPCP 1: Mild Pain Expected\nIbuprofen\n400 mg 1 h before\nPCP 2: Mild to Moderate Pain Expected\nIbuprofen + \nhydrocodone \n(Vicodin)\n400 mg 1 h before surgery + continue 4 \ntimes daily for 2 days\n5 mg/300 mg as needed\nPCP 3: Moderate Pain Expected\nIbuprofen + \nhydrocodone \n(Vicodin ES)\n400 mg 1 h before surgery + continue 4 \ntimes daily for 2 days, then as needed\n7.5 mg/300 mg 4 times daily for 2 days, \nthen as needed\nPCP 4: Severe Pain Expected\nIbuprofen + \nhydrocodone \n(Vicodin HP)\n400 mg 1 h before surgery + continue 4 \ntimes daily for 4 days, then as needed\n10 mg/300 mg 4 times daily for 2 days, \nthen as needed\nFrom Misch CE: Contemporary implant dentistry, ed 3, St Louis, \n2008, Mosby.\nBOX 10.1 World Health Organization \nPain Relief Ladder\nThree-Step Conceptual Model\n1.

This may \nbe based on the patient’s medical history, past pain threshold, \ntype of procedure, extent of tissue relection, and duration of \nprocedure. Because of the various agents and numerous \noptions for the treatment of postsurgical pain after dental \nimplant surgery, a pain control protocol was formulated to aid \nin the proper administration of these agents. According to the \nWorld Health Organization guidelines, the procedure and \npatient must be evaluated and classiied as mild, moderate, or \nsevere (Table 10.5).\nMild pain. Mild pain is self-limiting and usually will be \nresolved with normal recommended doses of NSAIDs.\nModerate pain. Moderate pain is more intense pain than \nmild and usually will not be resolved totally by NSAIDs. \nIt will interfere with function and disrupt the activities of \ndaily living.\nSevere pain. Severe pain is deined as pain that interferes \nwith some or all of the activities of daily living.

The patient should be informed that swelling is \nmost likely to occur after implant surgery and will peak at \n48–72 hours. Often, patients will exhibit minimal swelling the \nday of surgery; however, it will most likely increase 2–3 days \npostoperatively. This will prevent the patient from misinter-\npreting the swelling as a postoperative infection. The patient \nshould be instructed to use multiple pillows because sleeping \nwith the head elevated decreases head and neck swelling.\nHygiene. Patients may gently brush their teeth during the \nirst day; however, they should avoid the surgical site. Gentle \nrinsing with chlorhexidine may be initiated the day after \nsurgery. Potent antiseptics (e.g., Listerine) should be avoided \nuntil incision line closure.\nDiet. The patient should be counseled that following dental \nimplant surgery, the body requires adequate luids and nour-\nishment. Ideally, at least 2 liters of luids (milk, water, non-\nacidic juice) should be consumed within the irst 24 hours. \nThe patient should gradually progress to more solid foods. A \nhigh-calorie diet with increased volume of liquid and soft \nfoods for the irst 24 hours is recommended. Soft foods are \nusually tolerated well. These include milkshakes (use a spoon: \nNO straw), ice cream, applesauce, pudding, jello, yogurt, \nmashed potatoes, scrambled eggs, pasta (no tomato sauce). \nHot liquids (coffee, tea, soup, etc.) should be avoided until \nlocal anesthesia has worn off (~4–8 hours).\nIf the patient was administered intravenous sedation, the \npatient should be instructed to have some food intake after \nsurgery because they have been NPO for a minimum of 6 \nhours prior to surgery. This should be in the form of a soft \nfood such as yogurt, jello, soup, or ice cream.\nNo Smoking or Alcohol Use. Patients should have a thorough \nunderstanding of the effects of smoking and alcohol use post-\noperatively on incision line opening and implant/bone grafting \nmorbidity. Smoking cessation should be initiated a minimum \nof 2 weeks prior to surgery and 6 weeks (ideally) postsurgery. \nThe use of alcohol prior to complete incision line healing \nshould be discussed because this may lead to an increased pos-\nsibility of incision line opening and possible infection.\nNerve Impairment. Patients should have an understanding \nof the possible consequences of nerve damage, which may \ninclude paresthesia, dysesthesia, and anesthesia. If this occurs \nand is present after 24 hours, the patient should be instructed \nto inform the doctor to be seen immediately for evaluation \nand treatment (see Chapter 9).\nInfection. Although postoperative infections are rare, the \npatient should be informed of the signs of infection, which \nmay include sudden increase of swelling, pain, elevated tem-\nperature, and lethargy. If any of these should occur, the \npatient should inform the ofice of their symptoms.\nNOT GIVING ADEQUATE POSTOPERATIVE \nINSTRUCTIONS\nPatients should always receive postoperative instructions \nboth verbally and in writing. Failure to do so may increase \nthe possibility of postoperative complications and loss of \nconidence in the doctor and place the doctor at risk for \nmedicolegal issues.\nEtiology\nUnfortunately, many doctors do not have a consistent pro-\ntocol for the administration of pre- and postoperative \ninstructions. This leads to patient misunderstanding about \nexpectations after surgery, after-hours phone calls, and \nincreased stress for the patient. Additionally, many clini-\ncians have one generic or generalized instruction protocol. \nIdeally, there should exist an instruction protocol that is \nspeciic for the type and invasiveness of the procedure.\nPrevention\nDetailed postoperative instructions should be given orally \nand in writing to the patient before and after surgery. The \ninstructions should also be available for the patient on the \nofice website if possible.\nTreatment\nComprehensive review of all postoperative instructions is an \nimportant part of treatment. Some of the more common \ntopics for which instructions should be presented to patients \ninclude the following:\nBruising. The possibility of bruising or ecchymosis should \nalways be explained to the patient, even for shorter-duration \nand less invasive surgeries. It is crucial the patient understand \nthe possibility of bruising because this may lead to embar-\nrassment and esthetic issues for the patient. The patient \nshould be made aware that bruising can appear 3–4 days \npostoperatively and may take up to 10–14 days for complete \nresolution. Additionally, patients should be informed about \nthe possibility of bruising extending into the submandibular \nand neck area (because of fascial planes and gravity) because \nthis will minimize the possibility of patients questioning \neither an aggressive or poor surgical technique by the doctor.\nBleeding. The incidence of bleeding postoperatively is \nextremely high after dental implant surgery. Patients should \nbe cautioned on the potential for bleeding during the irst 24 \nhours and instructed on techniques to decrease the bleeding. \nPatients should always be given gauze (3 × 3 or 4 × 4 gauze \nis recommended because 2 × 2 pads may result in inadvertent \naspiration by the patient) for use as pressure dressings. Rec-\nommendations should be given to minimize wearing an \ninterim prosthesis because this may result in increased bleed-\ning. For signiicant or prolonged bleeding, the patient should \nbe instructed to contact the doctor (see Chapter 7). The \npatient should also be instructed not to use a straw when \ndrinking luids because this may create a negative pressure"

Ideally, the \nprosthesis should not be worn until incision line closure and \ninlammation is not present. If the patient is to wear the \nprosthesis for social esthetic concerns, the doctor should \nadjust the prosthesis to preserve the primary stress-bearing \nareas so the surgical area has no pressure areas.\nPostoperative Follow-Up. Patients should have an under-\nstanding of the importance of postoperative follow care. \nUsually, the patient is seen within 2 weeks of the surgery for \nevaluation and suture removal.\nDiscontinuation of Current Medications. Patients should \nfully understand that they should never discontinue or \nmodify any medication prescribed by their physician. \nThis may result in a serious complication if the patient fails \nto take medication such as antihypertensives, hypoglycemics, \nor anticoagulants.\nNAUSEA AFTER SURGERY\nNausea is not uncommon after dental implant surgery. Post-\noperative nausea is usually brief and resolves within several \nhours. It may be very distressing to the patient, though, espe-\ncially if they have been NPO (nothing by mouth) prior to the \nprocedure.\nEtiology\nThe etiology of nausea after surgery may be a direct result \nfrom prophylactic medications or the swallowing of excessive \namounts of blood, especially after longer procedures. The \nmost common prophylactic medications to cause nausea are \nantibiotics. When patients are NPO for IV sedation, many \nantibiotics have a high incidence of causing nausea (e.g., Aug-\nmentin, clindamycin).\nPrevention\nNarcotic pain medications are the most frequent cause of \nnausea and should be avoided until the nausea subsides. \nNausea can be reduced by preceding each pain pill with a small \namount of soft food, and taking the medication with a large \nvolume of water. The prophylactic steroid recommended for \nmost implant surgeries, Decadron, has been shown to be an \nexcellent medication for prevention of postoperative nausea \nand vomiting (PONV). Additionally, minimizing the swallow-\ning of excessive amounts of blood will reduce the possibility \nthat the blood will irritate the stomach mucosa. The meticu-\nlous removal of blood from the surgery site via suctioning and \nthe use of gauze throat packs will minimize the swallowing of \nblood. Yankauer suctions are especially eficient with remov-\ning blood from the oropharynx area (Fig. 10.6).\nTreatment\nIf nausea is extensive after surgery, OTC antiemetics may be \nused or prescription medications (e.g., ondansetron [Zofran] \n4-mg sublingual tablets) may be prescribed.\nFIG 10.6 (A) Clostridium dificile (C. diff), normal bacteria \npresent in the gut, may cause infection resulting from antibi-\notic use.

The frequency of this complication \nvaries among antibiotics. In most cases, no pathogens are \nidentiied and the diarrhea is caused by alterations in the \ncomposition and function of the intestinal lora. AAD has \nbeen deined as a minimum of three watery stools per day. \nThis diarrhea may occur from a few hours to up to 2 months \nafter antibiotic intake. Studies have shown the incidence of \nAAD after antibiotics is between 5% to 25%.25\nEtiology\nAAD results from an imbalance in the colonic bacteria. The \nalteration in the microbiota will change carbohydrate metab-\nolism and fatty acid absorption resulting is osmotic diarrhea. \nAlmost all groups of antibiotics may cause AAD, but those \nwith broad-spectrum coverage—in particular, cephalospo-\nrins, luoroquinolones, extended-coverage penicillins, and \nclindamycin—are known to have the highest frequency.26\nPrevention\nTaking antibiotics with food helps to minimize AAD. Also, \nmany studies have shown that the use of probiotics decreases \nthe incidence of AAD.27 These techniques are extremely \nhelpful if the dental implant patient presents with a past \nhistory of AAD.\nTreatment\nPatients with mild diarrhea not caused by C. dificile usually \nwill not require any treatment other than antibiotic cessa-\ntion. Lost luids and electrolytes should be substituted and"

If a substitute \nantibiotic is required, consultation with the patient’s physi-\ncian is recommended. If the patient exhibits any signs of \ndehydration they should be referred to their physician or \nemergency room.\nPSEUDOMEMBRANOUS COLITIS\nIn some cases of AAD, colitis (inlammation of the colon) will \nresult. This may lead to a condition called pseudomembranous \ncolitis. Symptoms usually include profuse diarrhea associated \nwith cramps, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever. In \nsevere cases, pseudomembranous colitis may be fatal if not \ntreated aggresively.\nEtiology\nAn additional consequence of antibiotic therapy that causes \ndiarrhea is the overgrowth of the pathogen Clostridium dif-\nicile.28 More commonly known as C. diff, it may account for \nup to 10% to 20% of AAD cases. This occurs when inlam-\nmatory colitis results in the destruction of a signiicant \namount of the normal gut lora. With the decreased amount \nof “healthy” bacteria, C. diff will lourish, causing signs of \npseudomembranous colitis (see Fig. 10.6).\nPrevention\nDental implant patients who present with a past history of \nAAD or C. diff infection should not be administered any \nantibiotics until medical consultation with the patient’s phy-\nsician. Additionally, patients who are predisposed to C. diff \ninfection include the elderly population. Patients older than \n65 have a 10 times greater chance of a C. diff infection than \nyounger age groups. Patients with a past history of a C. diff \ninfection are at a 20% greater risk of contracting C. diff after \nantibiotic administration.29\nTreatment\nDiscontinuation of the antibiotic regimen is highly recom-\nmended along with referral to the patient’s physician for \ntreatment. Severe cases of C. dificile–positive diarrhea require \noral antibiotic treatment of Vancomycin (125 mg four times \ndaily), metronidazole (250 mg three times daily), or bacitra-\ncin (25,000 units four times daily).30 These medications \nshould always be prescribed by the patient’s physician.\nIMPLANT-RELATED COMPLICATIONS\nINJURY TO ADJACENT TEETH\nDamaging adjacent natural teeth during dental implant \nplacement may lead to adverse effects on adjacent tooth \nstructures and can result in dental implant failure. The injury \nto the root structure of adjacent teeth may be direct (damage \nto tooth by the drill or implant) or indirect (thermal damage \nfrom the osteotomy process). Damage may result in bone \nloss, natural tooth or implant loss, infection, internal or exter-\nnal resorption, loss of tooth vitality, or prosthetic failure.\nEtiology\nTrauma to adjacent teeth may occur upon the placement of \ndental implants because of improper angulation, implant sites \nwith insuficient available space or bone quantity, or by place-\nment of implants with an incorrect diameter. Dilacerated \nroots and excessive tilting in the mesiodistal direction may \nimpinge on the implant space and prevent ideal placement. \nAdditionally, available space discrepancies often exist between \nthe coronal space and the apical space. Studies of orthodontic \nmini-implants placed in contact with teeth (<1.0 mm) have \nbeen shown to cause root resorption. However, if the implant \nis removed in a timely fashion, cementum repair will result.31\nPrevention\nThe location of adjacent teeth to the implant site should be \nevaluated prior to implant placement. The angulation should \nalways be evaluated after the initial osteotomy with a direc-\ntion indicator (i.e., radiograph with known diameter and \nlength guide pin in osteotomy) to assess proper positioning. \nCone beam computed tomography (CBCT) surgical tem-\nplates may be used to avoid damaging adjacent root surfaces. \nIdeally, a minimum of 1.5 mm of space between the implant \nand root surface is recommended (Figs. 10.7 and 10.8).\nTreatment\nPerioperative. If the implant is encroaching on the peri-\nodontal ligament (PDL) or tooth structure, ideally it should \nbe removed and repositioned.\nPostoperative/Posthealing. If the implant has been previ-\nously placed and is not encroaching on the PDL/tooth \n(asymptomatic) structure, strict monitoring should be done \nwith regular vitality testing. If the tooth is sensitive to thermal \nstimulation of percussion, the implant should be removed \nimmediately.\nIMPLANT PERIAPICAL LESION\nFollowing implant placement and recall examinations, case \nreports have shown the genesis of periapical lesions (radio-\nlucency), which may suggest a possible precursor to failure \nof the endosseus implant.32 These periapical lesions have \nbeen termed apical peri-implantitis and retrograde peri-\nimplantitis.33 The lesions have been deined as a symptom-\natic or asymptomatic periapical radiolucency developing \nafter implant placement with a normal coronal bone to \nimplant interface.\nEtiology\nAsymptomatic. A clinically asymptomatic periapical radiolu-\ncency is considered to be inactive when radiographically there \nexists evidence of bone destruction with no clinical symp-\ntoms. This may result from placing an implant into a site in \nwhich the osteotomy was prepared deeper than the implant \nlength, resulting in an apical space. Also, when implants are \nplaced adjacent to a tooth with an apical scar, this may result \nin a radiolucency. Inactive lesions may be caused by thermal"

Witt and Swann reported 13 \ncases of failed total hip prostheses and concluded the tissue \nreaction in response to metal-wear debris may have been the \netiology of the failed implants. This process has been termed \nrepassivation and may produce an oxide that surrounds and \nturns the periimplant tissues black.40\nYamauchi et al reported a titanium-implanted pacemaker \ndeveloping an allergic reaction. The patient developed a dis-\ntinct erythema over the implantation site, which resulted in \na generalized eczema. Titanium sensitivity was conirmed by \nintracutaneous and lymphocyte stimulation testing.41\nIn the dental literature, allergic reactions to pure titanium \nare rare. However, many authors have suggested there is a \nhigher incidence of titanium alloy allergy with respect to \ndental implants; and is most likely underreported because of \na poor understanding of failure or allergy.42 Preez et al have \nreported a case of implant failure due to a suspected titanium \nhypersensitivity reaction around a dental implant. Histologic \nresults showed a chronic inlammatory reaction with concom-\nitant ibrosis.43 Egusa et al reported a titanium implant over-\ndenture case that resulted in generalized eczema that fully \nresolved after implant removal.44 Sicilia et al, in a clinical study \nof 1500 consecutive implant patients, reported approximately \nnine implants with a positive reaction to titanium allergy.45\nEtiology\nSensitivity to titanium has been shown to be a result of pres-\nence of macrophages and T lymphocytes with the presence \nof B lymphocytes, which result in a type IV hypersensitivity \nreaction.46 All metals, when in a biologic environment, \nundergo corrosion, which may lead to the formation of"

Harloff used spectral anal-\nysis to investigate various Ti alloy implants. The results \nshowed that all the Ti alloy samples contained small amounts \nof other elements such as beryllium (Be), cobalt (Co), chro-\nmium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), and palla-\ndium. These impurity elements have been shown to be the \netiology of the hypersensitivity reactions.48\nPrevention\nThorough medical history involving any past history of tita-\nnium hypersensitivity.\nTreatment\nWhen titanium hypersensitivity is suspected, the implants \nshould be removed and the patient should be referred to their \nphysician for appropriate testing. Case reports have shown \nthat, after complete removal of the implants, complete resolu-\ntion results.44 Metal sensitivity is usually diagnosed using a \n“patch-test,” which involves placement of titanium (allergen) \nto the skin for approximately 3–4 days. A positive test would \ninclude the appearance of an erythematous reaction. However, \nthere is a possibility of false negatives because the sealing \nqualities of the skin against direct contact may make the test \nunreliable (Fig. 10.10).\nFRACTURED MANDIBLE AFTER  \nIMPLANT PLACEMENT\nMandibular jaw fractures after implant placement, although \nrare, may lead to devastating complications for the patient. The \nfracture may be early (at the time of surgery) or late (during \nthe postoperative period). Most likely, patients will appear \npostoperatively with severe pain, inlammation, and limited \nopening. The incidence of mandibular fractures after implant \nplacement is approximately 0.2%.49 The most common loca-\ntion for fractures to occur after implant placement (late frac-\nture) is near the location of the most distal implant.50\nEtiology\nFractured mandibles most likely occur from attempting to \nplace implants in patients with severely resorbed ridges, espe-\ncially when monocortical grafts and ridge-splitting surgeries \nare completed. Patients who are predisposed to fractures \ninclude those with highly excessive occlusal forces, or with \ndivision C−w and D mandibles. Studies have shown a higher \nincidence of fractures in patients who present with osteoma-\nlacia or osteoporosis. This is due to the brittle bone being \nsubject to loading forces with insuficient support. Additional \ncauses of mandibular fractures include placing implants that \nare too wide or too long, which compromises the host bone \nand requires excessive tightening of implants.50 Late (after \nsurgery) mandibular fractures most likely are caused by an \nincreased stress at the implant site. The implant generates a \nconcentration of tensile stress that weakens the bone. Repeated \nfunctional forces placed on the implant eventually lead to the \nfracture of the bone.51\nPrevention\nThe prevention of mandibular fractures includes proper \ntreatment planning and diagnosis, which involves the con-\ntraindication of implants placed in division D mandibles. \nDivision D patients should be referred for possible iliac crest \ngrafting. When drilling osteotomy sites in severely resorbed \nmandibles, care should be exercised to not overheat the \nbone. This is most easily completed by using intermediate \ndrills, removing less bone with each drill size. Additional \ntechniques include bone plates and simultaneous implant \nplacement.\nTreatment\nThe treatment of a fractured mandible after implant place-\nment is referral to an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for \ndeinitive care and possible removal of the offending \nimplants, along with reduction and stabilization of the man-\ndible. Treatment of mandibular fractures is usually based on \nthe type and location of the fracture as well as the extent of \natrophy. Treatment options include lag screws, wires, and \nplates (Fig. 10.11)."

Vertigo is most often \ncharacterized by the feeling of a spinning or swaying move-\nment when the patient is stationary. Often BPPV is associated \nwith nausea, vomiting, sweating, and dificulties in walking. \nBPPV is an unexpected complication that has been reported \nafter dental implant and bone grafting surgery.\nFIG 10.11 Fractured mandible.

The crystals migrate into the semicircular canal. \nThe crystals are not only sensitive to dislodgement but also \nto prolonged static head positioning. They strike against sen-\nsitive nerve endings (cupula) within the balance apparatus in \nthe semicircular canal (ampulla), which results in position- \nor motion-induced vertigo and disequilibrium.52"

The patient is positioned in an upright sitting posture, legs \nfully extended and the head rotated 45 degrees towards \nthe side.\n2. The patient is then quickly and passively forced down \nbackwards by the clinician performing the treatment into \na supine position with the head held approximately in a \n30-degree neck extension for 1–2 minutes.\n3. The patient’s head is then rotated 90 degrees to the oppo-\nsite direction, while maintaining a 30-degree neck exten-\nsion for 1–2 minutes.\n4. With the head and neck in a ixed position relative to the \nbody, the patient rolls onto the shoulder, rotating the head \nanother 90 degrees in the direction that they are facing. \nThe patient is now looking downwards at a 45-degree \nangle for 1–2 minutes.\n5. The patient is slowly brought up to an upright sitting \nposture while maintaining the 45-degree rotation of the \nhead, and the patient holds the position for 30 seconds.\n6. The entire procedure may be repeated two more times, \nfor a total of three times.53\nPrevention\nDo not allow patients to maintain hyperextension of the neck \nfor an extended amount of time. During maxillary posterior \nsurgery, be conscious of the possibility of dislodgement of the \ncrystals with the use of osteotomes and a mallet.\nTreatment\nThe only successful treatment for BPPV is referral to an oto-\nlaryngologist (ENT) physician or health care provider with \nknowledge of the Epley procedure (canalith repositioning). \nThis treatment consists of several slow head position maneu-\nvers (Box 10.2 and Fig. 10.12). The goal is to move the dis-\nlodged particles from the semicircular canals of the inner ear \nto the vestibule.\nCOVER SCREW NOT FULLY SEATED\nWith two-stage dental implant surgery, localized supericial \ninfections including a istulas tract may occur postopera-\ntively. After implant placement, if the cover screw is not ade-\nquately tightened, postoperative infections may result, leading \nto possible implant morbidity.\nEtiology\nBecause of the micro gap between the implant and cover \nscrew, trapped bacteria will colonize, which results in a pos-\nsible irritation and infection. This may occur from improper \nplacement of the cover screw or excessive force over the sub-\nmerged implant.\nPrevention\nTighten the cover screw at the time of placement so no micro \ngap exists. Care should be noted to remove any tissue or bone \nthat may impinge on the proper seating of the cover screw. \nCaution should be exercised to not overtighten the cover \nscrew in D4 bone (Misch classiication) because this will \nresult in the possibility of reducing the initial ixation of the \nimplant. Additionally, relieve the prosthesis over the surgical \nsite so no force may be transmitted to the top of the implant \n(Fig. 10.13).\nTreatment\nRemove the cover screw and, if tissue impingement is the etio-\nlogic factor, remove with a hand tissue punch, tissue punch bur, \nor laser. If bone is present, use a proiling bur (end cutting) to \nremove the bone. A high-speed handpiece should not be used \nbecause implant damage may result. A healing abutment \nshould be placed to allow for ideal healing of the tissue.\nPARTIAL COVER SCREW EXPOSURE \n(TWO-STAGE)\nWhen the cover screw becomes partially exposed during the \nhealing period (two-stage technique), the implant is suscepti-\nble to premature loading, increased bone loss, and infection.\nEtiology\nWith two-stage implant surgery, the cover screw may become \nexposed because of:\n• Incision line opening\n• Excess tension on the incision line\n• Thin tissue (thin biotype)\n• Interim prosthesis pressure\n• Immediate implant placement\n• Implant design—high surgical cover screw\nPrevention\nTo prevent premature opening, tension should be released \nfrom the incision line. This will allow for tension-free closure \nand minimal pressure on the incision line. The interim pros-\nthesis should be adjusted to have no direct contact on the \nsurgical site.\nTreatment\nA partially exposed cover screw will retain more bacteria and \npredispose the implant to increased bone loss and morbidity. \nThe implant should be uncovered (tissue punch bur) and the \nsmallest permucosal extension (in height) should be used. \nIdeally, the permucosal extension should be 1 mm above the \ntissue height. No attempt should be made to resuture and \nobtain primary closure. The patient should be instructed on \nproper hygiene to include gentle brushing of the abutment \nalong with the use of chlorhexidine (Fig. 10.14).\nTISSUE IMPINGEMENT BETWEEN \nABUTMENT AND IMPLANT\nIn some cases, if the inal abutment becomes loose during the \nhealing period or prosthetic rehabilitation, tissue impinge-\nment may result.

This may even occur from leaving out the \nhealing or prosthetic abutment on the implant for an extended \namount of time.\nPrevention\nPrior to placing any abutment, make sure all tissue is removed \nfrom around the circumference of the implant. After place-\nment of a prosthetic abutment or try-in of the inal prosthesis, \na periapical radiograph is recommended to conirm complete \nseating. If a gap is present on the radiograph between implant \ncomponents, soft tissue impingement should be assumed.\nTreatment\nA tissue removal bur in a rotary handpiece, tissue punch, or \nlaser of the appropriate size should be used to remove any \ntissue from around the implant or abutment. A radiograph \nshould always be taken to verify complete seating.\nBONE IMPINGEMENT BETWEEN THE \nABUTMENT AND IMPLANT\nIn two-stage implant surgery, it is not uncommon for bone \novergrowth to be present over the top of the implant (cover \nscrew). The excess bone must be removed to allow for proper \nseating of a cover screw, healing abutment, impression trans-\nfer, or inal prosthetic abutment (Fig. 10.16).\nEtiology\nBony overgrowth or interference is most likely to occur when \nthe implant is placed slightly below the crest of the bone. In \nsome cases, when the ridge is uneven (higher lingual plate vs. \nbuccal plate), the implant is placed at the level of the buccal \nbone; however, the lingual plate of bone will impinge on the \nabutment or cover screw. This will result in improper seating \nof the implant components.\nPrevention\nThe implant should be placed at the level of the buccal and \nlingual heights of bone. If bone is present above the implant, \nthe circumferential bone should be removed. Care should be \nexercised to avoid damaging the implant."

Addition-\nally, many studies have shown women to be more likely \nto experience chronic pain syndromes, as well as patients \nabove the age of 40, those with smaller-sized mandibles, \nsmokers, diabetics, and those with advanced bone resorption \n(Fig. 10.17).\nPrevention\nTo minimize the possibility of nerve damage during dental \nimplant surgery, the implant dentist must be cautious around \nall vital structures (e.g., mental nerve). CBCT-based radiog-\nraphy should be used to determine the exact amount of avail-\nable bone to avoid damage to nerve tissue.\nAnother complication that may lead to nerve injury is \nthermal damage produced by an implant drill. Signiicant \ncare must be taken to minimize heat generation. The clinician \nshould use minimal pressure, a sharp drill, and “bone \ndancing” when performing osteotomies, as well as copious \nirrigation. Neural tissue has been shown to be easily damaged \nby heat stimuli, reducing the ability of bone tissue to repair \nand regenerate.55\nManagement\nThe treatment of neuropathic pain is complicated and is not \nwell understood. There exist many types of treatment modal-\nities to manage chronic neuropathic pain.\nRemoval of Implant. Renton et al showed that implants \nshould be removed within 24 hours of placement if patients \nexhibit neuropathic pain. The early removal increases the \nprobability of resolution of symptoms. In comparison, \nimplants removed 3 to 90 days after placement showed no \nresolution of the neurosensory complications.56\nPsychologic. The psychologic status of the patient needs to \nbe evaluated, ideally with a consultation by a clinical psy-\nchologist or psychiatrist. Psychologic variables may include \ndepression, distress, ADHD, unrealistic treatment expecta-\ntions, and background environmental factors.\nPharmacologic. In the literature, there are various pharma-\ncologic agents that have been attributed to the treatment of \nneuropathic pain.57\nTricyclic Antidepressants (amitriptyline, desipramine, and \nnortriptyline): The mechanism of action of these drugs is to \ninhibit the reuptake of monoamines and to block sodium \nchannels along with exerting anticholinergic effects.\nSerotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (dulox-\netine, venlafaxine): (SNRIs) are potent inhibitors of the \nreuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, which are neu-\nrotransmitters that play an important role in the mood of the \npatient. They are popular in the treatment of major depres-\nsion disorders and chronic neuropathic pain.\nAnticonvulsants (gabapentin and pregabalin): The main \nmechanism of action is the decrease of central sensitization \nand nociceptive transmission.\nLocal Anesthetics: Although usually used as a diagnostic tool, \nlocal anesthetics have been shown to have therapeutic value in \nsome instances of chronic neuropathic pain because of their \nmembrane stabilization potential. Local anesthetics suppress \nsympathetic sprouting, which has been associated with NP.58\nTopical Medications (lidocaine or benzocaine): Other medi-\ncations, such as amitriptyline, carbamazepine, and ketamine, \ncan be added to the mixture (with lidocaine) by a compound-\ning pharmacy with the local anesthetics.\nOpiates/Analgesics: Opiates have been shown to be ineffec-\ntive in the treatment of neuropathic pain. Because this pain \nis chronic, the use of opiates is not recommended because of \npossible addiction.59\nPain Specialist. Patients with the neuropathic pain that \ncannot be resolved surgically, pharmacologically, or psycho-\nlogically should be encouraged to be evaluated at a chronic \npain clinic or pain specialist.\nFRACTURED IMPLANT\nAlthough rare with today’s dental implants, fractured implant \nbodies may cause signiicant problems for both clinicians and"

(A) Inferior alveolar nerve (arrow). (B) Failing implant that \nmay cause chronic severe pain. \nA\nB\npatients. Dental implant fractures may be one of the major \ncauses of late implant failures and may include possible medi-\ncolegal issues. Studies by Goodacre et al relate the risk of \nimplant body fracture in the early to intermediate period for \nimplants 3.75 mm in diameter to be approximately 1%, the \nabutment screw fracture risk at 2%, and the prosthetic screw \nrisk at 4% (Fig. 10.18).60\nEtiology\nThe incidence of implant body fracture dramatically \nincreases when force conditions are greater. Cantilevers, \nangled loads, and parafunction increase the risk of fracture. \nThe risk of fracture also increases over time. Typical \nmechanical failures are due to either static loads or fatigue \nloads. Static load (i.e., one load cycle) failures cause the \nstress in the material to exceed its ultimate strength after \none load application. Fatigue load failures occur if the mate-\nrial is subjected to lower loads but repeated cycles of that \nload. The endurance limit or fatigue strength is the level of \nhighest stress a material may be repetitively cycled through \nwithout failure. The endurance limit of a material is often \nless than one-half its ultimate tensile strength. Therefore, \nfatigue and ultimate strength values are related, but fatigue \nis a more critical factor, especially for patients with para-\nfunction because they impose higher stress magnitude and \ngreater cycles of load. Different materials have varying \ndegrees of resistance to repeated loading and subsequent \nfatigue-related failures. The fatigue strength of titanium \nalloy (Ti-6Al-4V) is four times greater (and safer) than \ngrade 1 titanium, and almost two times greater than grade 4 \ntitanium. Long-term fracture of implant bodies and compo-\nnents may be dramatically reduced with the use of titanium \nalloy rather than any grade of commercially pure titanium \n(Fig. 10.19 and Table 10.6).\nPrevention\nTo reduce the possibility of implant body fracture, a titanium \nalloy implant should ideally be used. Parafunctional habits \nshould be addressed with occlusal guards, narrow occlusal \ntables, no lateral contacts, and an ideal occlusal scheme.\nTreatment\nThe ideal treatment for a fractured implant includes the \nremoval and possible replacement of the implant.

Additionally, denture \nadhesive may lead to impaired healing with resultant incision \nline opening and possible failure of the implant or bone graft. \nIdeally, no interim prosthesis should be worn. However, this \nis unrealistic in many cases because some patients are more \nsocially active and esthetically conscious.\nEtiology\nIf the interim prosthesis does not have an occlusal stop (rest \nstop on teeth) or is not utilizing the primary stress-bearing \nareas (maxilla: horizontal palate; mandible: buccal shelf), \nnormal occlusal forces will overload the surgical site. This \nmay result in premature loading and implant morbidity \nincluding bone loss or failure of the implant.\nPrevention\nPatient Education. If the patient demands to wear the pros-\nthesis, they should be instructed to wear it as little as possible. \nExplaining to the patient the inherent disadvantages of \nwearing the prosthesis should be addressed. Patients should \nalso be educated on the complications of the use of denture \nadhesive, especially if the adhesive is placed in approximation \nto the incision line.\nProsthesis Modiication.

After the material is placed on the surface of a \nprosthesis and seated intraorally, the material is allowed to \nlow as the patient closes their bite into maximum intercuspa-\ntion or appropriate interocclusal relation. After the material \nsets, excess amounts are trimmed using a sharp, heated knife \nor scalpel.\nPlacing a tissue conditioner in a prosthesis for frequent \nliner replacement is a relatively simple procedure, but a soft \nliner material that is not changed frequently, as per the manu-\nfacturer’s recommendations, can cause excess pressure and \ntissue damage to the surgical site. Plasticizers can leach out, \nwhich will result in a hardened material. Thus the selection \nof tissue-conditioning material used is paramount to mini-\nmize loading of the implant or bone graft site.\nSome of the most common tissue conditioners are \nCoe-Comfort (GC America Inc.), Lynal (DENTSPLY Caulk), \nand Visco-Gel (DENTSPLY International). When there is \ngreater tissue mobility and inlammation (post implant \nplacement or bone grafting), the use of a less viscous material \n(more lowable) is indicated. Thus, Visco-Gel is usually the \ntissue conditioner of choice because it has favorable low \ncharacteristics, resists bacterial invasion, and is usually \nreplaced every 30 days compared with other tissue condition-\ners, which need to be replaced every 2–3 days.\nTreatment\nProsthesis Modiication. The internal surface of the prosthesis \nis aggressively relieved 3–5 mm over the surgical site. A common, \nbut incorrect, method is relieving the entire intaglio surface of \nthe prosthesis. This will result in overloading the surgical site \narea. The langes should also be removed over the surgical site.\nTissue Conditioners. The proper use of tissue conditioners \nshould be adhered to because a thicker viscosity should be \nused to minimize migration of the tissue conditioner material \n(Fig. 10.19, see Box 10.3). Migration of the tissue conditioner \nmaterial may lead to impingement into the incision line, \nwhich may result in impaired healing.\nTRAUMA FROM EXPLANTATION  \nOF IMPLANTS\nIn some situations a failing implant or the position of the \nimplant necessitates removal with reinsertion in an ideal \nposition. The following are possible reasons why dental \nimplants may need to be removed:\n• Mobility of the implant\n• Extensive bone loss\n• Chronic pain\n• Advanced peri-implantitis\n• Fractured implant\n• Malpositioned implant\nFIG 10.19 (A) Modiication of prosthesis to include hollowing \nout implant site areas to maintain primary stress-bearing \nareas. (B) Flange removal and relief made over implant sites \nwhile maintaining primary stress-bearing area. \nA\nB\nSoft reline material. Soft relines have been classiied as \neither acrylic or silicone. Silicone soft liners include heat-\ncured liners similar to Molloplast-B. This is a gamma-\nmethacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane heat-polymerized \nsilicone.61 Soft reline materials may be used; however, \nthey should be relieved over the surgical site. Acrylic soft \nreline materials are usually cold-cured and also should \nbe relieved over the incision area.\nTissue conditioner. Tissue conditioners are soft elasto-\nmers that are classiied as plasticized acrylics, which are com-\nposed of a poly (ethyl methacrylate) mixture of phthalate \nplasticizer and up to 25% ethanol. The enclosed plasticizer \nlowers the glass-transition temperature so the rigid acrylic \nresin becomes rubbery and resilient.\nTissue-conditioning material, when mixed properly, \nresults in a gel of the polymer and monomer with a resilient \nconsistency. The resilient gel provides an excellent cushion for \ntraumatized tissue adjacent to the intaglio surface of the hard, \nprocessed denture-base material. When the tissue-treatment \nliner is replaced frequently, the damaged intraoral supporting \ntissues can return to a state of health. Effective use of any \ntissue-treatment material may require replacement every 3 \ndays for up to 30 days depending on the material. Eventually, \nthese materials will become hard and rough and may harbor \nbacteria and fungus."

Prosthesis preparation: Remove suficient acrylic from the \ntissue surface overlying the surgical site. A minimum of \n1–2 mm is required for bulk of material and the ability for the \nmaterial to low. If a lange exists that may impinge on the \nsurgical site, the lange should be removed.\n2. Mix the tissue conditioner: Follow the manufacturer’s rec-\nommendation for proper powder-to-liquid ratio. Additional \npowder may be added to thicken the mixture, thus reducing \nthe low of the material when the prosthesis is inserted. \nWater-soluble petroleum jelly is applied to facilitate easy \nremoval of the excess material.\n3. Seat the prosthesis in the mouth: Have the patient occlude \nin centric occlusion.\n4. Trim the excess material: After suficient setting time (≈10 \nminutes), the prosthesis is removed from the patient’s \nmouth, and excess material is removed with a sharp knife \nor scalpel.\nComplication\nTaking an aggressive approach to remove an implant may lead \nto further bone loss and jeopardize the future site for reim-\nplantation. Because an implant does not contain a periodon-\ntal ligament, placing too much force and pressure on it may \nlead to buccal or lingual plate failure. Loss of bony plates or \nexcessive bone loss may result in the need for extensive bone \naugmentation in the future.\nTreatment\nThe removal of dental implants is dictated by the location, \namount of bone present, type of implant, and presence of \nmobility.\nMobile Implant. The loss of the bone-implant integration \nnecessitates immediate removal because infection and further \nloss of bone may result. In certain cases, the implant may migrate \nwithin tissue spaces or may be swallowed or aspirated.\nCounter-torque Ratchet: This technique involves placing an \nabutment or an engaging extraction tool into the implant and \nreverse torqueing the implant counterclockwise. This tech-\nnique is usually very atraumatic.\nConvention Extraction Techniques: This method utilizes con-\nventional forceps and elevators and should be used only with \nminimal luxation to prevent possible fracture of the buccal or \nlingual plate. After removal, all soft tissue should be removed \nfrom the implant site prior to grafting or reimplantation.\nNonmobile Implant. A partial or fully integrated implant is \nusually more problematic and can be rather dificult to \nremove. Conventional extraction techniques should never be \nused because they may lead to signiicant bone loss or frac-\nture. If a inal crown and abutment is present, they should be \nremoved to allow for easier access.\nCountertorque Ratchet: This technique involves placing an \nabutment or an engaging extraction tool into the implant and \nreverse torqueing the implant counterclockwise. This should \nbe used only in poorly dense bone (~maxilla). Care should \nbe exercised in higher-density bone because damage or frac-\nture of the adjacent bone may occur with this type of removal \ntechnique. There are many factors affecting the ease of \nimplant removal via the countertorque technique:\nHex (~D1-D2). An internal hex implant is easier to remove \nvia the countertorque method. External hex implants, because \nthey engage coronal to the implant body, are more dificult \nto remove because of lack of leverage. Trilobe internal con-\nnections, especially those with smaller diameters, have been \nshown to fracture when greater than 45 N/cm of torque is \napplied.62 Care should be exercised to prevent fracturing the \nimplant upon removal.\nImplant thread shape. There are four types of implant \nthread designs: buttress, square, V-shaped, and reverse but-\ntress. The square thread shape has the highest bone-implant \ncontact (BIC) and will be the most dificult to remove via the \ncountertorque method.\nImplant body design. A tapered implant design will be \neasier to remove than a square implant design. The thread \ndepth and surface area decreases in the apical area, which \nminimizes the torque force necessary for removal.\nAntirotational design. Some implant designs contain a \nvent or opening, usually at the apical end, that will allow for \nbone growth integration. This will complicate the removal of \na partially or fully integrated implant. A trephine or surgical \nbur technique may be indicated in the removal of these types \nof implants.\nReverse Screw Techniques: A reverse screw removal drill is \nutilized when the internal aspect of the implants (threads) are \ndamaged or when the countertorque method is unsuccessful. \nCaution should be exercised with smaller-diameter internal \nimplants (~3.0 mm) because fracture of the implant body \nmay occur (Fig. 10.20).\nHigh-Speed Burs: The use of a high-speed bur is a fast, \neficient technique to remove an integrated implant. Ideally, \na tapered surgical bur (extra long: 700 XXL) is used to mini-\nmize bone removal. The bur is used 360 degrees around the \nimplant to a depth of one-half to three-fourths the length of \nthe implant to be removed. Copious amounts of saline should \nbe used to minimize thermal damage and the possibility of \nosteomyelitis. This helps to maintain bone and minimize \ndamage to vital structures. After removal, the implant site \nshould be irrigated to remove any particles (Fig. 10.21).\nPiezo Surgical Units: A piezo surgical unit uses piezoelectric \nvibrations to cut bone tissue. By adjusting the ultrasonic fre-\nquency of the unit, it is possible to remove hard tissue while \nleaving soft tissue untouched by the process. Studies have \nshown that piezo units cause less soft tissue damage compared \nwith other extraction techniques (Fig. 10.22).63\nTrephine Burs: Trephine burs are barrel-shaped burs that \nhave various diameters. The bur selected should be slightly"

The \ntiming of implant displacement into the maxillary sinus proper \nhas been shown to range from the time of surgery to 10 years \nafter prosthetic rehabilitation.70 When implants are determined \nto be displaced into the maxillary sinus, immediate evaluation \nand removal should be rendered. If left untreated, the displaced \nimplants may become calciied (antrolith) or migrate into \nadjacent anatomic areas. Case reports in the literature have \ndocumented displaced implants in the maxillary sinus and \nmigrating into the various regions of the head and neck.\nMaxillary Sinus71. All case reports discussing the migration of \nimplants (either early or late migration) ind that they originate \nin the maxillary sinus because of its anatomic location with \nrespect to the maxillary posterior region. After displacement \ninto the maxillary sinus, the dental implants have been reported \nto migrate to various anatomic areas (Fig. 10.24).\nMaxillary Sinus Ostium70. The maxillary ostium is the main \ndrainage location of the maxillary sinus into the nasophar-\nynx. The mucociliary action of the maxillary sinus cilia \npropels any secretions through the ostium, into the infun-\ndibulum, through the hiatus semilunaris, into the middle \nmeatus, and inally into the nasopharynx. The functional \nmaxillary ostium has been documented to be approximately \n2.4 mm in diameter, thus signiicantly smaller than a regular-\nsized dental implant.72 The physiologic action of the maxil-\nlary sinus will transport the dental implant into the ostium \narea, most likely blocking the area and causing nonpatency. \nNonpatency of the maxillary ostium will lead to infection or \ncause the implant to erode through the ostium to other ana-\ntomic areas (see Fig. 10.24).\nNasal Cavity73. Dental implants may migrate from the max-\nillary sinus into the nasal cavity via extrusion through the \nostium or erosion through the medial wall of the sinus (lateral \nwall of the nasal cavity). The medial wall of the maxillary is \ncomposed of a very thin layer of cortical bone (<0.5 mm) \n(Fig. 10.25).\nEthmoid Sinus64. The bilateral ethmoid sinuses arise within \nthe ethmoid bone and form distinct air cells superior to the \nmaxillary sinus (between the orbits). These pyramidal air \ncells are divided by thin septa and bordered by the middle \nturbinate and the roof of the maxillary sinus. Dental implants \nmay migrate to the ethmoid sinus via the ostium or erode \nthrough the superior wall of the sinus (Fig. 10.26A).\nSphenoid Sinus74. The sphenoid sinus originates in the \nsphenoid bone in the center of the skull. The pneumatization \nFIG 10.23 Trephine burs.

In the posterior maxilla it is common \nfor the bone quality to be poor (≈D4), consisting of very ine \ntrabecular and no cortical bone. Because of the poor bone \nquality, the bone lacks density and strength and cannot \nmaintain rigid ixation of the implant. Forces applied to the \narea or negative intrasinus pressure may lead to the migra-\ntion of the dental implant into the maxillary sinus proper \n(Fig. 10.29).\nPoor Surgical Technique. Because of the poor bone quality, \nif the osteotomy is prepared with a conventional drill \nsequence (e.g., routine, standard manufacturer’s protocol), \noverprepa ration of the osteotomy site will result. Because of \nthe overpreparation, there will be insuficient bone at the \ncrestal level to maintain rigid ixation and migration may \noccur. Therefore, underpreparation or the use of osteotomes \nshould be utilized when preparing osteotomies in these com-\npromised areas.\nImplant Placement Without Bone Graft. Treatment planning \nin the posterior maxilla should coincide with the Misch sinus \naugmentation protocol (SA-1–SA-4). For an implant to be \nplaced without bone grafting, a minimum of 8–10 mm is \nrequired. Less than 8 mm of bone will predispose the implant \nto lack of rigid ixation and the possibility of mobility or \nmigration. For the implant to be placed with bone grafting, a \nminimum of 5 mm of host bone is required for initial ixation. \nUnder-preparation of the osteotomy site is recommended to \nmaintain as much bone for initial ixation of the implant.\nGalindo-Moreno et al completed a retrospective study on \nmigrated dental implants. They reported in 73% of the \nmigrated implant cases, no bone grafting was completed in \nconjunction with implant placement. The average bone \nheight for implant placement was approximately 5.2 mm. \nThe mean length of the implants was 13.43 mm, which \nresulted in no bone contact of approximately 8.23 mm of the \nimplant surface. Therefore, the main reason for implant \nmigration was lack of bone grafting with insuficient bone for \ninitial ixation.76a\nImmediate Implant Placement. With the popularity of \nimmediate implants, there is a greater possibility of an implant \nbeing displaced into the maxillary sinus after the extraction of \na multirooted maxillary molar. This is most critical in the irst \nmolar area, where the defect from the extraction results in"

If the dental \nimplant migrates through the ostium, the implant may be \ntransported through normal physiologic channels in the \nparanasal sinuses. Many case reports exist in the literature \nshowing the long-term effects of dental implants not retrieved, \nincluding chronic rhinosinusitis, fungal infections, and neo-\nplastic changes (Fig. 10.30).82,83\nDISPLACEMENT OF IMPLANTS: MANDIBLE\nAlthough uncommon, implants may be displaced and migra-\ntion may occur in the mandible. This may occur from two \nmechanisms: (1) sublingual osseous undercuts and (2) focal \nosteoporotic bone marrow defects (Fig. 10.31A).\nSublingual Undercuts\nBecause of the inherent sublingual undercuts in the posterior \nmandible, dental implants may be placed that result in a lack \nof bone for initial ixation of the implant.

The most common approaches for removal of implants \ninclude the traditional Caldwell-Luc procedure, intraoral \napproach, or a transnasal approach with functional endoscopic \nsinus surgery. Pagella reported the use of an intraoral endo-\nscopic (FESS—functional endoscopic sinus surgery) extraction \nof a metallic foreign body from the maxillary sinus.79 Regev \nreported the use of the Caldwell-Luc operation (anterior max-\nillary wall approach) and also retrieval through an intraoral \npreparation site approach.80 A multicenter study compared \nthese three methods of removing implants from the paranasal \nsinuses.

To prevent the mandibular displacement, the osseous \ncontours of the bone should be evaluated with three-\ndimensional radiography (Fig. 10.31B). Because of these sub-\nlingual undercuts, implants are often contraindicated when \nthese conditions are present.\nFocal Osteoporotic Bone Marrow Defects\nIn middle-aged women, radiolucent lesions may be present, \nusually in the molar area, that are associated with a higher \nrisk of implant displacement. The defects are generally \nasymptomatic and are mainly determined during CBCT \nevaluation of the posterior mandible. They are isolated or \nmultifocal radiolucencies, several millimeters to centimeters \nin diameter, with ill-deined borders. Most cases are seen in \nedentulous sites (Fig. 10.31C).84–86\nMIGRATION OF ALLOGRAFT\nSeok et al reported on a lateral wall sinus graft into a maxil-\nlary sinus with active infection. The allograft was completed \nwith a known membrane perforation and preexisting maxil-\nlary sinus pathology. Shortly after the surgery the patient \nreported a submandibular swelling, which required the \nremoval of the submandibular gland. Upon biopsy the sub-\nmandibular lymphatic vessels contained bone graft material \nthat originated from the maxillary sinus. It was concluded the \ngraft material migrated from the maxillary sinus to the sub-\nmandibular lymph nodes through the lymphatic vessels. The \nmaxillary sinus lymphatic vessels drain through the natural \nostium and via the nasal lymphatic vessels into the subman-\ndibular lymph nodes (Fig. 10.32A).87 Treatment included the \ncomplete removal of the submandibular gland.\nBONE GRAFT TACK MIGRATION\nBone tacks are often used to ixate membranes, usually in \ncombination with bone grafting procedures. In many \ninstances, to minimize tissue trauma in removing the tacks, \nthey are left in place after implant placement. Unfortunately, \ntacks can separate from the bone and migrate within the soft \ntissue and fascial spaces (Fig. 10.32B–C).88 Therefore, it is \nrecommended to remove the ixation tacks after bone healing \nis complete.\nMIGRATION OF DENTAL MATERIALS\nWhen extracting maxillary molar teeth, care should be exer-\ncised to minimize the possibility of extruding material (e.g., \nimpression material, reline material) in the maxillary sinus \nvia an oral-antral communication. When oral-antral com-\nmunication exists, dental materials that may be inadvertently \nextruded into the sinus proper. When this occurs, the material \nwill become calciied within the maxillary sinus from the \ndeposition of salt around the foreign body. The resultant \ncalciied mass is an antrolith, which is a common cause of \nchronic rhinosinusitis (Fig. 10.33).89\nEtiology\nAfter extraction there are two main causes of material being \nintroduced into the maxillary sinus. When an impression is \ntaken or when a prosthesis is relined, if the clinician \nunknowingly places signiicant pressure upon seating the \nimpression tray or prosthesis, the material, especially if it \nhas low viscosity, may low into the sinus via a communica-\ntion. With respect to individual teeth, the irst molar is the \nmost common tooth to have roots in approximation to the \nsinus cavity. Studies have shown the palatal and mesiobuc-\ncal root to be in contact or perforating into the maxillary \nsinus approximately 66% of the time.90 Therefore, after \nremoval of the maxillary irst molar, there is a high proba-\nbility of communication with the maxillary sinus and \nspecial caution should be exercised prior to impression \ncompletion.\nPrevention\nWhen mixing the reline or impression material, an increased \nviscosity should be used as this will decrease the possibility"

The implant clinician who is aware of potential \npostoperative complications in all phases of implant therapy \nwill be ready to treat any situation in a rapid and competent \nmanner. An understanding of the necessity of maintaining \nclose communication with the patient throughout the entire \ntreatment process is crucial. Knowing the potential for these \ncomplications beforehand and communicating them to the \npatient, along with a using a strong follow-up protocol, gives \nthe patient further conidence in the clinician should any \ncircumstance arise. This is beneicial to reduce stress for \nthe implant clinician and the patient, which minimizes the \nchances of medicolegal issues."
