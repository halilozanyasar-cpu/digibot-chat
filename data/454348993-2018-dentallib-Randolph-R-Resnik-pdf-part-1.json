    "content": "F OR EWOR D\nOral Implantology has developed and progressed into a \ncentral core of the art and science of dentistry. This ield, \nover the course of its existence, has transformed from a \nmodality on the fringes of the profession to being embraced \nby virtually every component and aspect of our discipline. \nHowever, as with any clinical dental or medical discipline, \npatient outcomes continue to drive improvement of diagno-\nses, techniques and therapies. Improved management of \npatient clinical variations to treatment and unexpected \nresults fortunately are a product of adverse experiences. \nSimply put, the tough cases and negative clinical situations \nare the best teachers, and we are wise to grow as clinicians \nfrom them.\nThis textbook speciically addresses implant complica-\ntions for doctors on any point of their clinical learning curve, \nfrom novices to veteran clinicians with decades of experience. \nAs our profession continues to grow and share data on clini-\ncal experiences, new complications continue to arise, giving \nus all a chance to beneit in knowledge from said complica-\ntion. Presently, our profession is producing many excellent \nmeetings and publishing textbooks related to new concepts \nin the ield of Oral Implantology. However, very little has \nbeen dedicated to complications in the literature and from \nthe podium. This is understandable, as it is not particularly \nenjoyable to discuss the negative consequences that occur \nduring treatment, sometimes even despite our best efforts. \nThis book will provide the profession with a well-needed, \ncomprehensive textbook on a subject that is most likely to \nincrease in frequency in the future because of the ever- \ngrowing popularity of dental implants.\nThe editors of this text, Professors Randolph R. Resnik and \nCarl E. Misch, collectively bring over a half-century of clinical \neducation and experience to these chapters. Not only have \nthey spent decades as top educators in this ield, they have \nalso spent countless hours mentoring implant clinicians \nacross the world, reviewing cases and helping to provide \ncounsel for the management of complications that occur \nalong the way. Those experiences are what shape the content \nof this text. The information is presented in a logical sequence \nof clinical decision making, yet clearly is literature based on \nscience and peer-reviewed research. The subject matter is \nvery diverse and comprehensively encompasses all facets of \nimplant dentistry; diagnosis and treatment planning, surgical \nintervention, prosthetic rehabilitation, and the post-operative \nand maintenance phases of this discipline. The implant com-\nplications case reports contained in these chapters are well-\ndocumented and well-illustrated to serve as an outstanding \nguide for patient care.\nProfessors Resnik and Misch have assembled a wealth of \ntalent in the ield of Oral Implantology which provides a \nunique blend of clinical, academic, research, and medico-\nlegal experience. These contributors have spent their careers \non the front lines of this ield, encountering many of the situ-\nations that are discussed, either directly or indirectly. Their \ngoal is to reduce the clinical evidence of avoidable and \nunavoidable complication episodes that an implant clinician \nmay encounter in their practice.\nThe authors took a great deal of care to make this text \nextremely comprehensive in scope, and it shows in the deliv-\nery of the content. Through a unique technique of discussing \nthe etiology, prevention, and management of each complica-\ntion, the reader is guided by the authors to a better under-\nstanding of the fundamentals of treatment, making them able \nto obtain a strong foundation for the understanding and \ntreatment of these adverse events.\nOn a personal note, I have had a long relationship with \nProfessors Resnik and Misch, both professionally and person-\nally. I value the clinical and research mentorship provided to \nme by them over the past quarter of a century, and feel for-\ntunate to call these men professional colleagues and friends. \nWe who call ourselves practitioners of Oral Implantology \nhave all been in some way touched by their contributions to \nthe ield at large.\nJon B.

    "content": "PR EFACE\nDental implants have become an accepted therapeutic \napproach to rehabilitate patients with edentulous sites. Vast \namounts of time and resources have been dedicated to \nresearch and development within the discipline, and as a \nconsequence, very high survival rates are reported through-\nout the literature with a wide range of implant types and \nsystems. Despite all of these advances in oral implantology, \ntreatment associated with dental implants is not free of com-\nplications. There is a learning curve necessary to build clinical \ncompetency from both surgical and prosthetic aspects of \ntreatment, and situations occur that lead to less than ideal \noutcomes. Even with a high degree of experience, complica-\ntions can and will arise. These complications can occur intra-\noperatively, post-operatively, or many years after success. \nTherefore, it is inevitable that the implant clinician today will \nbe confronted with some sort of complication during the \nimplant treatment process.\nThe genesis of this complications book comes from over \n25 years of teaching at the Misch International Implant Insti-\ntute. Private practice in oral implantology and teaching \nhands-on surgery to doctors taught me that if you do enough \nprocedures, whether surgical or prosthetic, complications \nwill arise. What sparked my interest was the understanding \nthat even if a clinician is as careful as possible, problems \nassociated with the treatment do occur. Additionally, because \nmore dental implants are being placed and restored today, \nthis obviously will lead to more complications. Unfortu-\nnately, very little exposure is given to the diagnosis, etiology, \nprevention, and management of these complications. Even \nthe most benign procedures may lead to signiicant long-\nlasting devastating complications to the patient.\nThe lecture podium is an area where more often than not, \nsuccesses are discussed. New procedures and protocols are \nintroduced, and examples are given that outline the utility of \nthe presenter’s indings. As an educator that deals with the \nreality of complications with students and practicing clini-\ncians that I mentor, I found that a large opportunity existed \nto aid in the deeper understanding of clinical practice by \ndiscussing how and why things go wrong during implant \ntreatment. The popularity of the Complications seminar over \nthe years and the feedback we received helped solidify the \nconviction that I held – facing the sometimes harsh reality of \nwhat errors may occur and focusing on how to prevent them. \nThis ultimately helps instill a greater sense of conidence \ngoing forward in the pursuit of excellent clinical care.\nBecause of the popularity of dental implants and the ever-\nchanging technological atmosphere, the profession is in need \nof a literature based, comprehensive summary of possible \ncomplications. Technology is a vital component of the dental \nimplant industry. Because technological advances in implant \ndentistry are changing at an alarming rate, procedures \nare often recommended without guidelines for evaluation. In \nthe past, our philosophy would entail no recommendation \non a product or technique without at least ive years of data \nand experience. However, today, dental advertising and \nmanufacturers often give the industry misleading and inac-\ncurate information that may be detrimental and lead to \ncomplications.\nMisch’s Avoiding Complications in Oral Implantology is \ndesigned to be a comprehensive guide to the diagnosis, etiol-\nogy, and management of a wide range of treatment planning, \nsurgical, prosthetic, and maintenance complications. The \nunderlying theme of this book is the idea that the best way \nto treat complications is to “prevent” them from occurring. \nTherefore, this book includes factual information that is lit-\nerature based which allows the implant clinician to have a \nthorough understanding of basic principles and a strong \nfoundation for the recognition of complications.\nThe ive parts of this book discuss diagnosis and treatment \nplanning, surgical, prosthetic, periodontal and maintenance, \nand mediolegal aspects of dental implants;\n• Part 1: The diagnosis and treatment planning chapters \ninclude an understanding of various types of complica-\ntions, radiographic imaging complications associated with \nthe implant patient, factors associated with proper treat-\nment planning, and the medical evaluation of the dental \nimplant patient.\n• Part 2: Surgical complications are discussed, which include \nthe ideal positioning of implants in all planes along with \nthe treatment of malpositioned implants. Additional \nchapters include bone grafting complications, the treat-\nment and prevention of bleeding issues, the prevention \nof nerve injuries along with ideal management, incision \nline opening, intra-operative complications, and post-\noperative problems.\n• Part 3: The Prosthodontic complications chapters include \na detailed summary of ixed and removable complica-\ntions. This encompasses all aspects of treatment plan-\nning, procedural, and post-prosthetic complications. An \nentire chapter is dedicated to dental implant occlusion, \nspeciic for various types of prostheses along with biome-\nchanical factors.\n• Part 4: The periodontal and maintenance chapter includes \na detailed evaluation to the scientiic basis of periodontal \nrelated complications. The etiology, management, and \nprevention of these complications is discussed.\n• Part 5: The last chapter is dedicated to the possible med-\nical-legal aspects of implant dentistry. The entire legal \nprocess from pre-suit to a trial is reviewed with unprece-\ndented recommendations on the most common asked \nquestions concerning the legal process.\nIn summary, Misch’s Avoiding Complications in Oral \nImplantology is comprised of the most comprehensive, in-\ndepth summaries of possible complications the implant clini-\ncian may encounter. This book is not meant to scare the \nimplant clinician, but to educate them on what may possibly \nvii"

First, I would never have had the insight, ambition, and aspiration to \nwrite this book if not for the two mentors in my life, my late father, Dr. Rudolph Resnik and \nDr. Carl Misch.\nMy father was the perfect father, role model, educator, clinician, and a true pioneer in the ield \nof ixed prosthetics. He was my hero and my best friend, and the number one reason I am where \nI am today. His endless support and encouragement gave me the strength and motivation to \nsucceed both personally and professionally. It is through his life-long example that I emulate his \nwork ethic, tenacity, and drive by giving 110% in all that I do.\nDr. Carl Misch was not only my mentor, but also a very close personal friend and fellow col-\nleague for 30 years. His endless energy and enthusiasm inspired me to take on and complete such \na laborious task as writing this book. Carl, the true “pioneer of modern implantology”, allowed \nme to be at the forefront of this challenging profession and carry on his unprecedented principles \nand teachings in the ield of oral implantology.\nThis journey would not have been possible without the support of my wonderful family. First, \nI want to thank my wife Diane, she is my high school sweetheart, my best friend and number \none fan. She has been my rock to lean on and with her unwavering support I have been able to \nbecome the best at what I do. I also want to thank my two wonderful children, Christopher \nand Allison, who have made me so proud of their accomplishments and have driven me to com-\nplete this book. Christopher, who is following in my footsteps, soon to enter a prosthodontic \nresidency and Allison who is pursuing her dream in medical school. And last of all, my two furry \ncompanions, Charlie and Nellie, who sat by my side patiently for endless hours in the writing of \nthis book.\nI am sincerely appreciative to all the additional chapter authors for sharing their expertise \nwith the writing of this book. Their dedication to implant dentistry, and especially their friend-\nship and personal support to me, is greatly appreciated: Dean Jon Suzuki, Steven Caldwell, Robert \nResnik, Glenn Jividen, Joseph Cillo, Jarrett Faust, John Preece and Frank DeLuca.\nA special note of thanks to the staff at Elsevier for their energy, enthusiasm and creativity with \nthe content of this book.

    "content": "I N  M EM OR I A M\nThe world constantly teaches us lessons along the path of life, \nand one of its most bittersweet truths becomes apparent \nwhen we are put in the presence of a genius. Certain individu-\nals enter this world and make such an impact that we are left \nin awe of their accomplishments. They truly make a mark on \nwhat we know of life. The last lesson they bring us regards \nthe frailty of life’s gift. These geniuses, like all beings, leave \nthis life, and we are left to wonder what we will do without \ntheir guiding light.\nRecently, the medical community at large has lost one of \nits true geniuses, Dr. Carl E. Misch. His passion and life-long \ndream was to elevate the standard of care in implant den-\ntistry, and he worked tirelessly in the pursuit of that end. \nThrough the development of various principles and classii-\ncations that have led to the origins of modern implant den-\ntistry, he truly changed the lives of his students, colleagues, \nand patients. Along with his gifts as a highly skilled clinician \nwas an uncanny ability to engage and teach fellow dentists \nwhat he had learned along the way. He unselishly gave others \nthe gift of his knowledge, as his true belief was to always \n“share what you have learned”. Carl Misch was, in the truest \nsense of the words, a pioneer, teacher, clinician, friend, and \ncolleague.\nDuring his dental school years, the inquisitive dental \nstudent became fascinated with the little known ield of oral \nimplantology, which was still considered a discipline on the \nfringes of contemporary dental practice. Regardless, Carl \naggressively pursued is passion and placed his irst implant as \na 4th year dental student. Additionally, he was elected class \npresident by his classmates and was awarded a main podium \nposition as a dental student at an International Congress of \nOral Implantology in Germany. His fascination for knowl-\nedge in oral implantology led him to travel the world, seeking \nknowledge and experience from any of the earlier founders \nof oral implantology. This led to his tenacious pursuit of \nacquiring experience from some of the true pioneers in \nimplant dentistry include the likes of Leonard Linkow, Ken \nJudy, Hilt Tatum, Robert James, P.I. Branemark and Dr. Hans \nGrafelman.\nIn 1984, Dr. Misch founded the “Misch International \nImplant Institute”, which was one of the irst hands-on, one-\nyear continuums for dental implant education. The Institutes \nscientiic based curriculum became world-renowned and \nremains at the forefront today of implant dentistry through \nresearch, education, and its unique clinical applications. The \nMisch philosophy and teachings have evolved and expanded \nover the years, and has been taught in many cities in the \nUnited States, along with locations in Brazil, Canada, France, \nItaly, Japan, Korea, Monaco, Spain, and the United Kingdom. \nThrough the years, six major universities have used the Misch \nInstitute exclusively for the implant dentistry curriculum of \ntheir oral surgery, periodontal, or prosthodontic residencies. \nTo date, over 5000 dentists have been trained by the Misch \nInstitute and is known worldwide as the premier center for \ndental implant training.\nDr. Misch, in his life, was awarded numerous post- \ndoctoral degrees and recognitions. He was bestowed two \nPh.D. degrees (honoris causa) from the University of Yeditepe \nin Istanbul, Turkey, and Carol Davila University of Medicine \nand Pharmacy in Bucharest, Romania. He was awarded an \nhonorary degree and member of Omicron Kappa Upsilon, \nthe national dental honor society. Additionally, he has been \npresented with twelve fellowships in dentistry, including the \nAmerican College of Dentists, International College of Den-\ntists, Royal Society of Medicine, American Association of \nHospital Dentistry and the Academy of Dentistry Inter-\nnational. In 2014, the American Dental Association’s Board \nof Trustees awarded the Distinguished Service Award to Dr. \nMisch. This is the highest honor conferred by the ADA.\nIn the 1990’s, Dr. Misch authored the text, Contemporary \nImplant Dentistry, which is currently in its third edition and \nhas become one of the most popular textbooks in dentistry. \nThis book has been translated into 9 languages, including \nJapanese, Spanish, Portuguese, Turkish, Italian and Korean. \nAdditionally, his prosthetic text, Dental Implant Prosthetics \n(Elsevier) is in its second edition. His books are used in dental \nschools throughout the world for graduate and postgraduate \nprograms. In March 2017, the long-awaited textbook Avoid-\ning Complications in Oral Implantology will be published by \nElsevier, which is co-authored by myself and Dr. Misch. Dr. \nMisch authored over 250 articles and repeatedly lectured in \nevery state in the United States as well 50 different countries \nthroughout the world. Dr. Misch also held 16 patents in den-\ntistry and was the co-inventor of the BioHorizons Maestro \nImplant System.\nDr. Misch held Diplomate status at the American Board \nof Oral Implantology / Implant Dentistry and served as \nBoard President and member of the examining committee. \nHe also served as President of several implant organizations \nincluding the International Congress of Oral Implantologists, \nAmerican Academy of Implant Dentistry, Academy of \nImplants and Transplants and the American College of Oral \nImplantologists. He was a past president and Co-Chairman \nof the Board of Directors of the International Congress of \nOral Implantologists, the largest global implant organization. \nOther accomplishments include being deemed a “Knight” by \nthe King of Sweden and a chevalier of La Confrérie des \nChevaliers du Tastevin, an esteemed French wine society.\nDr. Misch had an unprecedented impact on the ield of \nimplant dentistry, as most techniques and procedures today \nare based on his original principles and classiications. In my \nopinion, one of the truest signs of a genius is the ability to \nforesee the need of technology well before the mainstream of \nsociety even recognizes the concept. He had more to do with \nthe inception, evolution, and current principles used today in \nimplant dentistry than any other practitioner in the ield. Few \nx"

    "content": "1\nClassiication of Dental Implant Complications\nRandolph R. Resnik\n1 \nOne of the main tenets of dentistry is the restoration of a \npatient to optimal form, function, and esthetics. In the history \nof the profession, few advancements have facilitated dentists \nin this pursuit more than the advent of the dental implant. \nThough historical evidence reveals humans were attempting \nto replace missing teeth with foreign materials since ancient \ntimes, the science of fully replacing teeth with biologically \ncompatible materials has been a very recent phenomenon. \nOral implantology, which encompasses the replacement of \nmissing teeth and their supporting structures with biologi-\ncally compatible materials, has drastically improved the \nquality of life for millions of individuals. Patients who were \nonce hopelessly edentulous now have the opportunity to \nachieve a full restoration to full chewing capability. People \nwho were once destined to undergo radical and continuous \nloss of the bone that supports esthetically vital facial muscles \nnow have a chance to maintain a youthful appearance. Young \npatients who were born with congenitally missing teeth now \ncan go through life with a normal esthetic presentation \nwithout having to cope with a removable appliance. Though \nthe study of dental implants is a rather recent phenomenon \ncompared to other medical subjects, the impact that the ield \nhas had on the quality of life for patients around the world \nis staggering.\nDue to the work of the many pioneers in the ield, oral \nimplantology has become a highly successful and viable \noption for the treatment of edentulous areas. High success \nrates for implant treatment have been shown through numer-\nous clinical studies. However, as more implants are being \nplaced, the number of complications are increasing. Even \nwith technologic advances in oral implantology, this type of \ntreatment is not void of complications, even many years after \ncompletion. These complications appear both surgically and \nprosthetically, with varying degrees of severity in conse-\nquence. Prosthetic complications leave patients without the \nrestorations they ultimately desire, due to functional and \nesthetic issues stemming from inadequate implant place-\nment, improper diagnosis, or a lack of understanding about \nthe forces acting upon the prosthetic components. Surgical \ncomplications can lead to implant failure, neurosensory \nimpairments, infections, signiicant bleeding episodes, and \npossibly death. As oral implantology grows as a discipline, the \nield of dentistry will be confronted with these complications, \nand knowledge of how to treat them is pivotal to the long-\nterm success of the treatment.\nCOMPLICATION STUDIES\nIn review of the literature, many studies have evaluated the \nprevalence of complications, both surgically and prostheti-\ncally. McDermott et al., in a retrospective study, evaluated \napproximately 2400 implant cases and determined an overall \ncomplication frequency of 13.9%.1 Jung et al. reported a 39% \ncomplication rate associated with ixed implant-retained res-\ntorations over a 5-year period.2 Serrano et al. in a multi-\ncenter retrospective study found a 50% complications rate \nwith removable implant prostheses.3 Many other studies have \nevaluated the speciic complications (Table 1.1).\nETIOLOGY OF COMPLICATIONS\nIncreased Demand for Dental Implants\nThere is an ever-increasing demand for dental implants in the \nworld’s population today. This increased need and use of \nimplant-related treatments result from the combined effect of \nseveral factors, including (1) an aging population that is living \nlonger and more socially active, (2) tooth loss related to age, \n(3) consequences of ixed prosthesis failure, (4) anatomic \nconsequences of edentulism, (5) poor performance of remov-\nable prostheses, (6) consequences of removable partial den-\ntures, (7) psychologic aspects of tooth loss and needs and \ndesires of aging baby boomers, (8) predictable long-term \nresults of implant-supported prostheses, (9) advantages of \nimplant-supported restorations, and (10) increased public \nawareness.4\nA study by the American Association of Oral and Maxil-\nlofacial Surgeons noted a 69% incidence of at least one \nmissing tooth in the 35- to 44-year demographic group.5 By \nthe age of 75, at least one quarter of adults will be completely \nedentulous. These statistics, when blended in with overall \npopulation studies, begin to paint the picture for implant \ndemand. The percentage of the population over 65 years is \nincreasing, as is the overall human population. The popula-\ntion in 2000 was 282 million and is projected to increase 49% \nto 420 million by 2050. Considering the effect of both a \npopulation increase and a greater percentage of that popula-\ntion being older than age 65, a dramatic overall increase in \npatient numbers can be expected. In 2003, 35 million people \nwere older than age 65. This number is expected to increase \n87% by 2025, resulting in almost 70 million people being \nText continued on p. 6"

These factors are \nleading to explosive growth in the dental implant market.\nStraumann corporation performed a penetration study \nthat discussed the growth of the dental implant market by \n2020. As of 2011, 15% to 20% of the population of patients \nseeking the replacement of a missing tooth or teeth received \nimplant therapy as a restorative modality. This number is \nprojected to increase to around 25% to 30% in just 9 years.6 \nThe implant market is slated to grow 6% to 8% in this short \ntime frame. TechNavio’s analysts forecast the global dental \nimplant market to grow at a compound annual growth rate \n(CAGR) of 8.72% over the period 2014 to 2019.

Straumann reported that approximately \n18% to 20% of US dentists are placing dental implants, with \nan average of 55–60 implants being placed by each clinician \nin a year. This is compared to a 2004 study by the American \nDental Association (ADA) that had this number at 11%.8,9 As \nrecently as 10 years ago, oral implantology was not empha-\nsized in the dental school curriculum, but it is now being \ntaught as a core component of a student’s education. The \nnumber of general practitioners placing implants is growing \nand will continue to grow in the future. Additionally, techno-\nlogical advances are making it easier and more proitable for \nclinicians to treat advanced cases.\nManufacturers Course Training\nIn the 2007 ADA survey, general practitioners were asked \nwhere they received their training in dental implant place-\nment. Approximately 66% of these dentists had received spe-\ncialty training after completing dental school. The bulk of \nthe remaining practitioners had received their training in a \ncourse sponsored by a manufacturer. Due to the lack of expo-\nsure in the past to oral implantology in dental school, dentists \nare seeking quick access into the discipline for a low cost. \nDental implant manufacturers are attempting to ill this void \nby hosting continuums in oral implantology for the dental \npopulation that is seeking an introduction to this discipline. \nThough these short courses are better than the alternative of \nhaving dentists receive no training at all prior to placing \nimplants, there are deinitely inherent drawbacks.\nFirst, there is a lack of foundational didactic training on \ndental implant treatment planning, which is a cornerstone of \nsuccessful treatment outcomes. A irm understanding on \nprosthetic design, force distribution, and site development is \nparamount to achieving consistent successful dental implant \ntreatment outcomes. Secondly, the manufacturers tend to \noversimplify the treatment protocols in an effort to embolden \nclinicians to offer implant placement in their respective prac-\ntices. This places the dentist in a position of not being fully \naware of the potential complications they can encounter \nduring treatment and how to handle them should they arise.\nImplants Being Placed in Compromised Sites\nDue to the lack of formal training in comprehensive oral \nimplantology, dentists may lack a irm appreciation for site \ndevelopment as it pertains to the hard and soft tissues. Many \nedentulous sites and prosthetic designs require modiications \nto the proposed implant site. There is a tendency for dentists \n(early on their learning curve) to develop treatment plans \nthat allow them to avoid procedures they lack knowledge or \ncomfort in, so implants may be placed in suboptimal areas, \nwhich leads to various negative esthetic, prosthetic, and \nsurgical complications. Because of bone loss after tooth \nextraction, many sites are not ideal for implant placement \n(surgically and prosthetically). If the dentist lacks knowledge \nin bone grafting and site development, this may lead to alter-\nnative treatment options such as severely angled implant \nplacement, excessively short implant bodies, or the placement \nof too few implants for the force requirements of the patient’s \nproposed prosthetic design. All of these “shortcut” or “non-\nideal” procedures may lead to an increase in complications, \nlower success rates, and subsequent legal ramiications.\nFinancial motivation may also affect decision making as it \npertains to site development. A dentist may feel the pressure \nto “keep procedures in house,” which may lead to a deviation \nof proper treatment planning, especially if the clinician does \nnot possess the skill or knowledge required to augment hard \nand soft tissue. In areas of the mouth that show a lack of bone \nheight, width, density, or a lack of adequate soft tissue, a \npractitioner will be required to have greater education, expe-\nrience, and skill to navigate a proper treatment plan from the \nsurgical phases to inal prosthetic completion. Cases with \ncompromised tissue volumes typically require augmentation \nprior to implant placement, which requires a separate skill \nset. If a clinician does not possess these skills but proceeds \nwith a modiied treatment plan to work around the inherent \ndificulties that the patient’s anatomy presents, numerous \ncomplications and morbidities can occur in all phases of \ntreatment. This will ultimately lead to embarrassment, \nincreased procedural cost, and possible legal repercussions.\nMedically Compromised Patients\nWith the continued advent of new technologies, medications, \nand treatment options, patients are leading longer lives with \nhigher degrees of social activity. This phenomenon will con-\ntinue to increase as the population grows along with the \nunderstanding of disease prevention and treatment. The \nimpact of this for the modern dentist is the presence of a \npopulation of elderly patients who actively seek comprehen-\nsive dental care, in a search for a return to optimal form, \nfunction, and esthetics.\nAs was previously discussed, oral implantology is becom-\ning a larger part of this patient population’s knowledge base, \nand they are actively seeking this therapy to help enjoy a \nbetter diet, more active social lifestyle, and younger appear-\nance. However, this also places a higher demand on the dentist \nto understand the medical complexities that are inherent in \ntreating these patients. Patients present with numerous \ncomorbidities, take many medications that may affect \nimplant healing, and also pose a signiicant challenge for \nthe clinician during the surgical phases of treatment.10 Addi-\ntionally, signiicant advances in medicine have led to the \nadvent of new medications for many diseases. However, the \ninteraction of these medications on the healing of dental \nimplants can cause many complications and adverse effects \n(i.e., bisphosphonates).\nA survey study was performed showing that with patients \nin the 57- to 85-year range, 81% took at least one prescription \ndrug daily, with 29% taking at least ive medications.11 A"

Medications that are prescribed pre- and \npostoperatively may interact with the patient’s existing drug \nregimen. These factors must all be taken into consideration \nbefore beginning a treatment protocol. A lack of awareness \nof the effects of medication on dental implant treatment may \nlead to numerous unforeseen complications.\nWhen planning to begin treatment on an medically compro-\nmised patient, the clinician must also understand how various \nmedical conditions may affect the inal outcome. Cardiovascu-\nlar and respiratory disease may complicate surgery. Uncon-\ntrolled diabetes has signiicant effects on surgical healing and \nimplant integration. Anticoagulant therapies may pose a signii-\ncant risk for bleeding episodes during treatment. Long-term \nsteroid use can affect healing and infection risk. Each afirma-\ntive check on a medical questionnaire should be investigated \nand evaluated for a risk of possible complications to surgery.\nLack of Medical Clearance Prior to Surgery\nA key to success in treatment for the medically compromised \npatient is an area that is sometimes overlooked by the dental \nprofessional, and that is a strong working relationship with the \npatient’s physician. While performing the medical evaluation \non a patient presenting with a positive health history, the \nimplant dentist should take the time and effort to consult with \nthe treating physician to establish a pre- and postoperative \nplan, including drug protocols, ensuring that the patient expe-\nriences an outcome free from drug interactions and medical \ncomplications. Surgical clearances should also be obtained in \nan effort to minimize the risk that a patient experiences medical \ncomplications or life-threatening emergencies during implant \nsurgery. A failure to obtain such clearances puts the implant \ndentist in a serious medicolegal risk, should complications \noccur. (See the Medical Consultation Form in Chapter 2.)\nImmediate Implant Procedures\nThroughout the history of the discipline of oral implantol-\nogy, research studies have been performed to help practicing \nclinicians understand all aspects of implant dentistry, in \nan effort to provide patients with the best chances of experi-\nencing a successful outcome. These studies have shaped our \nunderstanding of how the body responds to the different \nimplant and graft materials, how the forces of mastication \nact on these materials, and how the microbial environment \naffects the long-term success of implant restorations. As \nthis understanding increased, designs for implants were \nestablished, treatment protocols and healing times were \nauthored, and drug regimens were established to maximize \nthe chance that treatments were successful.\nHowever, as the demand for implant services has increased, \nso has competition in that marketplace. Dental professionals \ncompete for patients, and dental implant manufacturers \ncompete for market share. This has led to the advent of more \nand more dental implant procedures that deviate from the \nestablished clinical guidelines set forth and conirmed by pre-\nvious research. Though many of these procedures and treat-\nment protocols can work and have been shown to be effective \nin the right hands, the skill requirements of these procedures \nmay prove to be too high for some practitioners, especially \nthose early on a learning curve. This leads to numerous surgi-\ncal and prosthetic complications.\nIn an effort to reduce the time in which a patient had to \nwait for a inal restorative outcome, a movement began to \nnot only immediately place an implant at the time of extrac-\ntion but also to load the implants at the same time. In the \nright circumstances (proper bone volume, density for rigid \nixation, and lack of infection), this treatment has been shown \nto be clinically effective. However, with the conirmation that \nthese procedures can indeed work, we have seen an exploita-\ntion of the treatment protocol to encourage this type of pro-\ncedure as a matter of routine. The pressures on implant \ndentists to produce “teeth in a day” may predispose them to \ntaking shortcuts and making surgical compromises that put \nthe patient at great risk for implant/prosthetic failure. The \nimplant dentist must understand that certain clinical criteria \nmust be present for these procedures to work, and that factors \nsuch as medical status, the presence of infection, or inade-\nquate bone volumes contraindicate such shortcuts.\nCatering to a larger population of dentists who may not \npossess the skills to create adequate bone volumes by grafting, \nmanufacturers have also pushed the boundaries in implant \ndesign in an effort to remove barriers to entry into the implant \nield. For example, to avoid the problem of having to build \nposterior maxillary bone volumes to ensure proper vertical \naxis loading of implants, clinicians have invented techniques \ninvolving angled placements of implants with severely angled \nabutment interfaces. Although these techniques have been \nshown to be successful, surgical experience and case selection \nare crucial factors for long-term success.\nOveruse of “Mini” Implants\nRecently, the use of “mini” dental implants to support remov-\nable and ixed prosthesis has dramatically increased in implant \ndentistry. Initially, the intended application of mini implants \nwas for provisional restorations during the healing phase of \nconventional endosseous implants (> 3.3 mm diameter). In \ntime, the use of mini implants was expanded to retain remov-\nable and ixed prostheses, which have become extremely con-\ntroversial. Manufacturers have since modiied the procedure to \ninclude minimally invasive techniques, which include inserting \nthe implant into the bone via lapless surgery. These techniques \nhave been marketed toward faster, easier, and less traumatic \nprocedures. However, this marketing has led to more mini \nimplants being placed in sites that would be more ideally suited \n(surgically and prosthetically) for conventional endosseous \nimplants. This has led to nonideal implant positioning, neuro-\nsensory impairment, atypical implant prosthesis, poor emer-\ngence proiles, biomechanical issues, and implant fractures.\nAt this time, there are very few studies evaluating the \nsuccess of mini implant under functional biting forces and"

Finite element stress analyses of mini \nimplants have been shown to exhibit high levels of risk \nbecause stress transmission to bone and fatigue fracture. \nBulard and Vance evaluated over 1000 implants and reported \na 13.6% failure rate.12 Shatkin reported more failures in the \nmaxilla with a 17% failure under a complete denture.13 Other \nstudies have shown fatigue fracture to be responsible for 5% \nand 20% of all implants lost during function.14 Therefore, \nmini-implants deinitely have a place in implant dentistry \ntreatment planning, however in most cases should not be \nsubstituted for conventional size implants.\nPoor Treatment Planning\nOne of the easiest ways to minimize complications, yet one \nof the most overlooked by implant dentists, is the ability to \naccurately and effectively treatment plan according to sound \nscientiic principles. Each patient presents a different chal-\nlenge for the clinician, which makes detailed knowledge of \ndental anatomy as well as the engineering of prosthetic cases \nso vital to successful outcomes.\nWithout signiicant knowledge of a patient’s maxillofacial \nanatomy, an implant clinician is placed in a potentially dan-\ngerous situation. The implant dentist must know the volume \nof bone in a proposed implant site and be aware of any \nundercuts that may be present. The presence of vital struc-\ntures such as sinuses and nerves must be accurately identiied \nand evaluated. Without this information, the clinician may \nperforate bony structures, causing neurosensory impairment \nthat provides sensation to the face and oral structures or pos-\nsibly severing blood vessels that may cause life-threatening \nbleeding complications.\nExcuses for this lack of detailed knowledge are quickly \nevaporating, as radiographic modalities such as cone beam \ncomputed tomography (CBCT) imaging are quickly becom-\ning the standard of care. Having an accurate 3-D representa-\ntion of the patient’s anatomy along with a irm understanding \nof how to read and interpret the image puts the clinician in \na much better position to avoid signiicant complications.\nUsing a working knowledge and accurate representation of \nthe patient’s anatomy, the clinician must be aware of overall \nsite selection and implant positioning as it pertains to the \ndemands of the restoration. If a clinician does not take into \nconsideration the design and demands of the inal prosthesis, \nthere exists a signiicant potential to place the implant in a \nposition that places destructive forces upon it during loading, \nwhich will cause either prosthetic or implant integrative failure.\nProtocols have been established featuring key implant \npositions to assist the implant dentist in properly selecting \nsites that optimize safe loading during function as well as \nestablishing safe distances between the multiple implants \nand/or adjacent teeth. Following these guidelines can assist \nthe clinician in knowing where the optimal site for an \nimplant lies, which then allows for an evaluation of that \nexact site as it pertains to the need for additional bone \nvolume via grafting. Neglecting these rules can place the \npatient at signiicant risk of implant loss, adjacent tooth loss, \nor prosthetic failure (see Chapter 6).\nPoor Communication With Patients\nThe implant dentist must understand the demands of the \npatient’s existing oral condition and their expectations for \nprosthetic options. Patients who exhibit parafunction require \ngreater implant numbers or implants of greater size dimen-\nsions. A patient who shows more teeth during smiling may \nrequire a different esthetic presentation than one with a low \nlip line. Patients with thin tissue biotypes in an esthetic area \nmay require tissue augmentation prior to implant placement. \nAll of these factors must be known to the practitioner prior \nto beginning treatment to avoid problems.\nArmed with all of the knowledge regarding implant treat-\nment planning, the clinician can and must effectively commu-\nnicate with the patient regarding expectations and demands. \nMany health care providers, including implant dentists, encoun-\nter complications when they acquiesce to the demands of a \npatient to perform questionable procedures. This can be avoided \nby knowing all of the ramiications of each treatment option \nand having the ability to communicate them. The patient must \nbe made aware of all possible options and the strengths/\nlimitations of each. They must understand the inancial impli-\ncations of treatment and know how that affects their treatment \noutcome. An example of this would be the edentulous mandi-\nble, where the number of implants placed dictates the type and \nstability of the inal prosthesis. If a patient is made aware ini-\ntially of their choice of two implants supporting a denture is \nmuch less stable than the alternative of four, the chances of \ndisappointment are reduced. Communicating the treatment \noptions clearly and setting clear expectations can help prevent \nnumerous complications, including medicolegal issues.\nPoor Understanding of Complications and Failure \nto Refer\nNo clinician expects to be faced with complications during \ntreatment. Despite all of the education, experience, and skill they \nmay possess, at some point the implant dentist will be con-\nfronted with a complication. As important as the prevention of \ncomplications is to the discipline of oral implantology, the quick \nidentiication and treatment of these events is equally impor-\ntant. The implant dentist must understand the myriad of risks \nassociated with each procedure and how to react to these issues \nshould they arise. During surgery, the severing of a blood vessel \nrequires a rapid response to ensure the prompt resolution of the \nincident. Failing to recognize or respond to a bleeding incident \nin a quick manner could lead to life-threatening complications. \nIf a complication during surgery was noted, such as the potential \nsevering of a nerve, the clinician does the patient a terrible dis-\nservice by avoiding the situation altogether and “hoping things \nheal on their own.” Prompt referrals for imaging and specialty \ntreatment are necessary and are the responsibility of the practi-\ntioner to allow the patient the best chance of a full recovery.\nEven after a seemingly successful surgery, the patient must \nbe monitored for postoperative complications. Incision line \nopening, one of the most common surgical complications, poses \na risk to a successful outcome, especially with grafting. Serious \npostoperative infections may occur that require prompt antibi-\notic therapy and even possible hospitalization. All of these"

The clinician must know how to recognize each \ncomplication and what avenues to pursue to get the situation \nunder control, even if it means referral to another doctor.\nCOMPLICATION CLASSIFICATION\nAlthough quality assessment is gaining increased attention in \nimplant dentistry, there exists no accepted consensus on how \nto deine and quantify complications. Because of the absence \nof a consensus, there is little continuity in the literature with \nregards to complications. In medicine, Clavien et al proposed \na classiication of complications, which has subsequently been \nused in the medical literature for outcome assessment. \nHowever, this classiication may not be the most practical for \nthe assessment of oral implantology complications.15 \n• Grade 1: Any deviation from the normal postoperative \ncourse that does not require pharmacologic intervention \n(i.e., pain, swelling)\n• Grade 2: Any deviation from the normal postoperative \ncourse that does require pharmacologic intervention (i.e., \ninfection)\n• Grade 3: A deviation that requires surgical intervention \n(i.e., incision and draining)\n• Grade 4: Life-threatening complication requiring hospti-\ntalization (i.e., sublingual hematoma)\nBecause of the wide variation in the ield of oral implan-\ntology, the authors have developed various classiications, \nwhich is dependent on type and phase of treatment. \nMinor vs. Major\nA minor complication is self-limiting and usually of short \nduration, with no permanent or lasting deicits. (e.g., swelling \nand bruising).\nA major complication is a more serious complication that \nis longer lasting, potentially permanent, with associated pos-\nsible morbidities (e.g., infection, nerve impairment).\nUnavoidable vs. Avoidable\nAn avoidable complication is a complication such as a nerve \nimpairment caused by placing an implant in the mandibular \ncanal, without the use of a CBCT scan to give the clinician \nan accurate representation of the proper nerve location.\nAn unavoidable complication is a complication that cannot \nbe avoided or preventable in most instances and is not directly \na result of negligence of the implant clinician. An unavoidable \ncomplication does not negate legal ramiications. However, it \ndoes favor the implant clinician, as it is considered a compli-\ncation that most likely could not have been avoided (e.g., \nnerve impairment secondary to administration of inferior \nalveolar nerve block).\nReversible vs. Irreversible\nReversible complications are complications that usually resolve \non their own and have no associated long-term morbidity \n(e.g., improper angulation upon implant placement after the \nirst drill osteotomy, which may be corrected easily).\nIrreversible complications are complications that are per-\nmanent and cannot be reversed, thus having increased sever-\nity and consequences (e.g., mandible fracture after implant \nplacement).\nLEGAL RAMIFICATIONS\nIn the past, legal issues concerning implant dentistry were \nminimal. In today’s practice, this is becoming an ever-\nincreasing and serious problem. Many years ago, the majority \nof complications were basically thought of as risks of the \nprocedure. Today, such complications are deemed a deviation \nfrom the standard of care by many. It is true that fewer dental \nlawsuits are brought before the court system today as com-\npared to in the past, but the cases that appear before the court \ntoday carry enormous awards if successfully tried for the \nplaintiff. Additionally, many more cases are being settled out \nof court because of the expense of litigation. Today, cases \ninvolving complications such as nerve impairments due to \nnegligence can settle in the six- to seven-igure range.\nFurthermore, with the advent of CBCT technology, the \nield of oral implantology is moving more toward “perfec-\ntion.” For example, if an implant fails, many possible reasons \nmay be given to explain why this has happened. Most doctors \nbelieve an informed consent will minimize these issues; \nhowever, this is usually not true. If negligence is proven \nagainst the clinician, the informed consent is deemed \ninadmissible, as a patient cannot consent to negligence. Most \nlikely, in the future, insurance premiums may become so \nhigh for these procedures that it will limit the use of implants \nby many practitioners. For the clinicians who continue to \nprovide implant services, it will be mandatory that they \nbe vigilant in the prevention and proper handling of \ncomplications.\nCOMPLICATIONS PREVENTION\nIn all aspects of health care, practitioners discuss the virtues of \ndisease prevention with their patients. In the practice of \nimplant dentistry, it is vital that clinicians practice that same \nphilosophy as it pertains to complications. The best way for the \nimplant dentist to treat complications is to “prevent” them.\nIncrease Education\nThe irst method of complication avoidance is the pursuit of \neducation. Implant dentists must have a irm and deep \nunderstanding about a wide spectrum of subjects ranging \nfrom CBCT interpretation and diagnosis, treatment plan-\nning, hard and soft tissue management, prosthetic design, \nesthetic presentation, pharmacology, surgical principles, and \nnumerous other subjects. It is vital that the aspiring or prac-\nticing implant clinician achieve a level of expertise in all \naspects of the discipline. Though the level of time and effort \ndevoted to implant education is increasing in dental schools, \nthe implant dentist must continue to add to his or her"

    "content": "11\nCHAPTER 1 Classiﬁcation of Dental Implant Complications\nknowledge regarding both the prosthetic and surgical facets \nof oral implantology.\nComprehensive \npostgraduate \ncontinuing \neducation \ncourses are available to dentists seeking a deep understanding \nof implantology. These typically consist of a combination of \nintense didactic and laboratory training sessions. The courses \noffer the implant clinician an opportunity to obtain a strong \nfoundation of the diagnostic, surgical, pharmacologic, and \nprosthetic sciences as they pertain to implant treatment. \nSome courses also offer a hands-on component to assist den-\ntists early on their respective learning curves with respect to \nvarious procedures they have never been exposed to.\nSeek Accreditation\nIt is also highly recommended for clinicians to test themselves \nby seeking accreditation with the various implant boards \nand groups. Groups such as the American Board of Oral \nImplantology/Implant Dentistry (ABOI/ID), the Inter-\nnational Congress of Oral Implantologists (ICOI), and the \nAmerican Academy of Implant Dentistry (AAID) offer fel-\nlowship and diplomate status to clinicians who pass various \ndidactic tests, while also presenting their own cases and \nresearch for peer review. This higher level of accreditation is \nvital for the implant dentist to perform because it helps to \nbuild a deeper understanding and greater mastery of the \nvarious aspects of oral implantology. The level of competency \nand credibility, after the many hours of study and preparation \nit takes to complete the accreditation process, cannot help but \nto make a clinician more knowledgeable about the ield, \nwhich is a crucial step toward avoiding complications.\nLiterature Review Updates\nAnother way for the prevention of implant complications is \nto become familiar with the process of literature review. As \nthe advances in the ield of oral implantology increase, more \ncompetition will arise, which will inspire new advances in \nthe ield. While some of these advances will stand the test of \npeer review and clinical success, many new procedures and \nequipment ideas will push boundaries and make unsubstan-\ntiated claims. A good piece of advice for the avoidance of \ncomplications is to “not be the irst, nor the last” to the latest \ntrends or ideas in the ield. Before implementing a new pro-\ncedure or piece of technology, it is wise to extensively \nresearch the subject to evaluate the validity of the advance-\nment. Be skeptical of manufacturer-driven studies because \nthey may show a signiicant bias toward the positives in the \nmethods or materials they intend to take to market. Be hesi-\ntant to accept any claim made by a company or spokesper-\nson until unbiased research has tested and proven its validity \nand the test of time.\nPatient Information\nIn order to prevent complications with the patient relation-\nship, the practitioner should give all possible treatment plans \nand options to the patient. This is absolutely paramount \nbecause it builds a set of expectations and a knowledge base \nfor the patient and provider. An example of this would be the \nrestoration of a missing single, edentulous site. The patient \nshould be given an option of no treatment (which must \nalways be offered), removable prosthetics, ixed prosthetics, \nor implant retained prosthetics. The patient should be \ninformed of the advantages, disadvantages, risks, and poten-\ntial complications regarding each treatment option. Doing so \nnot only gives the patient greater peace of mind because they \nare actively participating in the choice of treatment but it also \ngives the clinician the comfort of knowing that they accu-\nrately prepared the patient for the upcoming therapy. Expec-\ntations of compliance for each treatment option should also \nbe discussed and documented. All medical therapy is a \ntwo-way street between patient and provider, and the patient \nmust be responsible for compliance.\nDo Not Rush Treatment\nDuring treatment, the clinician can avoid substantial compli-\ncations by avoiding the urge to rush through the proper \nsequence and timelines for implant dentistry. Oral implantol-\nogy is unlike other disciplines in dentistry because patients \noften have to cope with the dificulties of transitional remov-\nable prosthetics, perimucosal extensions, sutures, and other \nitems they may ind uncomfortable. The implant dentist may \nfeel some pressure to lessen graft healing, implant integration, \nor progressive loading timelines in an effort to make the \npatient happy. The clinician must explain to the patient that \nthese timelines are necessary for proper therapy to be com-\npleted, and there isn’t much that can be done to lessen the \nwindow and still ensure a favorable outcome.\nTreat for the Long Term, Not the Short Term\nThe implant clinician may also be faced with the dilemma of \na nonideal outcome (e.g., bone loss upon uncover, open \ncontact, ill-itting margin). Though this can be a signiicant \nsource of embarrassment for the clinician and stress for the \npatient, it must be explained that for long-term success, the \nsituation may require modiication. Though the pressure to \ndo so may seem severe, the clinician must NOT alter their \nbest judgment by putting their patients at risk. Most of the \ntime-related problems and pressures from patients in regards \nto comprehensive implant treatment can be handled on the \nfront end of treatment with the aforementioned treatment \npresentation. The patient who is prepared for what is to come \nis much less likely to have problems and try to force the clini-\ncian into rushed procedures.\nFollow-Up Care\nThe last aspect of complication prevention is a policy of \nstrong follow-up care. Keeping communication open with \nthe patient through the phases of treatment is vital to staying \non top of any potential complication issues. The patient \nshould be instructed to inform the clinician of any dificulties \nimmediately as they pertain to incision line opening, neuro-\nsensory issues, or possible infection. Postoperative evalua-\ntions also provide the implant dentist with opportunities to \nevaluate healing, transitional prosthesis it, incision line \nclosure, the presence of infection, and the post-prosthetic"

A good follow-up care protocol builds strong \nbonds with patients and also allows the implant dentist the \nchance to identify and quickly respond to numerous \ncomplications.\nSUMMARY\nOral implantology is a discipline illed with complexity. The \nield demands its practitioners to have a high level of exper-\ntise in a vast array of areas, many of which evolve at a fast \nrate. The oral environment is dynamic, and perfect healing \nconditions are not always possible. Complications will inevi-\ntably happen, but steps can be taken to prevent them. These \ninclude a thorough and comprehensive medical/dental \nhistory; radiographic survey including CBCT; a strong \nworking knowledge of head and neck anatomy as well as \nsurgical, prosthetic, pharmacologic, and follow-up care prin-\nciples; and the ability to identify and treat a wide array of \ncomplications should they occur.\nEvery dentist who places or restores implants should be \naware of these complications and know how to manage \nthem. Some of the issues will require little intervention, while \nothers may require the services of professionals in other areas \nof expertise. It is the duty of the implant dentist to recognize \nall of these situations and know the proper protocols to \nfollow to ensure that the patient’s chances of success are \nmaximized.\nAccording to numerous market research studies, the future \nof dental implants seems to be extremely bright. With no \nother full-tooth replacement therapy on the immediate \nhorizon, the implant dentist enjoys the ability to provide the \nideal solution for the restoration of missing teeth. The clini-\ncians who provide this service can enjoy a good lifestyle while \nproviding patients with a second chance at regaining ideal \nform, function, and esthetics.\nWith the many opportunities that implant dentistry pro-\nvides comes a distinct responsibility and a sobering reality. \nOral implantology is a dificult ield to master, and the con-\nsequences of failure can be catastrophic. Patients may be at \nrisk for life-threatening complications. The stresses of surgery \nduring anesthesia pose a life risk for some patients. The \nvarious types of neurosensory impairments that patients have \nsuffered as a complication of implant treatment are tragic, \nlife changing, and have proven to be costly to the implant \nclinician. The professional and inancial ramiications of \nsome of these complications for the implant dentist are \nstaggering.\nIn the face of these scary realities, groups of well-trained \nand passionate professionals continue to provide this won-\nderful service to thousands of grateful patients every single \nday.

Resnik\n2 \nA comprehensive preoperative medical assessment of patients \nconsidering implant treatment is vital to successful outcomes as \nwell as the avoidance of signiicant complications. Studies have \nshown that the medical status of patients (i.e., medical history, \nAmerican Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] category) has a \ndirect correlation with endosseous implant failure.1 The need for \nimplant-related treatment increases with the age of the patient. As \na result, the implant dentist treats more elderly patients with \nassociated comorbidities than any other specialist in dentistry. An \nestimated 12% of the US population is 65 years of age or older; \nthis number is expected to reach 21% (64.6 million) in the year \n2030.2 The increased life span of the population directly correlates \nwith implant dentistry being one of the fastest growing areas in \nmedicine. Additionally, studies have shown that 15% to 25% of \npatients presenting to dental practices are medically complex, \nwhich encompasses a history of systemic diseases, multiple medi-\ncations, and age-related issues.3 Because the number of medically \ncompromised patients seeking dental implant therapy is increas-\ning, it is paramount the implant clinician understand the effect of \nsystemic diseases and associated medications on the intra-\noperative surgical procedures, which have a direct relationship \nwith the successful osseointegration of dental implants.\nCONTRAINDICATIONS TO TREATMENT\nInitially, when determining if a patient is a potential candidate \nfor implant treatment, a thorough medical and physical evalua-\ntion must be performed. From this information, the existence of \na possible medical contraindication is ascertained. In medicine, \na contraindication is deined as a condition or situation that \npotentially makes the procedure in question inadvisable. There \nexist two types of contraindications, absolute and relative, with \nrespect to dental implant procedures. An absolute contraindica-\ntion is a condition that makes the procedure completely inadvis-\nable. A relative contraindication is a condition that necessitates \ncaution and is acceptable as long as the beneits outweigh the \nrisks. To further clarify the contraindications in the ield of \nimplant dentistry, they may be classiied into three categories.\n• Surgical contraindication: A condition that places the \npatient at risk during the surgical procedure (e.g., advanced \nheart disease) and that potentially could result in a medical \nemergency. However, the condition does not impact mor-\nbidity or success of the implant procedure.\n• Implant contraindication: A condition that places the endos-\nseous implant healing at risk (e.g., IV bisphosphonates), \nresulting in a decreased success rate and increased morbidity. \nHowever, the condition does not impact the intraoperative \nmedical condition of the patient or place the patient as a \nmedical risk.\n• Surgical/implant contraindication: The combination of a \nsurgical procedure risk along with a risk for the success of \nimplant healing or longevity.\nMEDICAL HISTORY\nA comprehensive method of obtaining and documenting a \npatient’s medical history is essential to ascertain an accurate \ndiagnosis in order to determine an effective treatment plan \nalgorithm. A thorough patient evaluation provides the foun-\ndation for determining the patient’s surgical, anesthetic, and \nprosthetic risk, which directly affects morbidity and associ-\nated complications. The review of the patient’s medical history \nis the irst opportunity for the implant clinician to speak \ndirectly with the patient. The practitioner should not under-\nestimate the value of the medical history interview. Asking \nquestions that show an understanding of the listed medical \nconditions, current medications, and related common prob-\nlems is paramount for the safety and well-being of the patient.\nThe two basic categories of information addressed during \nthe review of the medical history include the current review \nof the patient’s systemic health condition and an evaluation \nof recent and current medications. This detailed medical \nhistory should also address possible allergies, family and \nsocial histories, all of which may impact the future dental \nimplant treatment, both surgically and prosthetically. Each \npositive answer on the medical history may have a direct \nimpact on the care of the patient and proposed treatment. \nThe implant clinician must have a strong understanding of \npositive responses associated with the medical history.\nCARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM\n Are you currently being treated for high blood pres-\nsure, or have you been told by a health care professional \nthat you have high blood pressure, or hypertension? \nYes /No?\nHypertension is a highly prevalent cardiovascular disease, \naffecting over 50 million Americans and 1 billion people"

The implant \ndentist and staff must be knowledgeable about the measure-\nment, detection, and treatment of hypertension. The accurate \nmeasurement of blood pressure, along with a review of all \nmedications including herbal and over-the-counter medica-\ntions, should be an integral part of the implant consultation \nand examination. This information must be reviewed in \ndetail with the patient prior to surgery. If an automatic blood \npressure–monitoring system is being utilized, a manual \nsphygmomanometer should be available to manually verify \nabnormal readings. Elevated readings (>160/100) should be \nveriied by manual techniques and the procedure discontin-\nued until the blood pressure returns closer to the patient’s \nbaseline or within a more acceptable range.\nOrthostatic hypotension. Hypertensive patients are more \nsusceptible to orthostatic hypotension when brought from a \nsupine to an upright position. This is caused by an excessive \nfall in blood pressure, which results in faintness, light-\nheadedness, dizziness, confusion, or blurred vision. Resolu-\ntion of this complication will occur rapidly upon placing the \npatient back in a supine position. Allowing patients to sit \nupright slowly will minimize these complications, especially \nafter longer procedures and in susceptible patients. Unless a \npatient has a serious medical contraindication (e.g., conges-\ntive heart failure, renovascular disease, chronic edema), they \nshould be instructed to hydrate prior to the surgical proce-\ndure. This may help reduce the occurrence of orthostatic \nhypotension.\nAntihypertensive medications + NSAIDs. The use of non-\nsteroidal antiinlammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been shown \nto lessen the effectiveness of various antihypertensive medi-\ncations by inhibiting prostaglandin production, leading \nto intraoperative hypertensive episodes. Blood pressure regu-\nlation is highly prostaglandin dependent, especially as it \nrelates to kidney function through the vasodilatory effects. \nNSAIDs possess a higher degree of interaction with diuretics, \nworldwide. An estimated 7.1 million deaths per year are \nattributable to hypertension, along with 62% of cerebrovas-\ncular disease and 49% of ischemic heart disease. Approxi-\nmately 30% of adults with hypertension are unaware they \nhave hypertension, and two thirds of patients treated are not \ncontrolled to blood pressure less than 140/90 mm Hg.4 The \noverall prevalence of hypertension is approximately 30% to \n45% of the general population; however, a steep increase with \naging is present.5 Untreated, undiagnosed, and uncontrolled \nhypertension is a serious problem in society today. Because \nimplant dentists treat a high percentage of elderly patients, \ncoupled with the high prevalence in the general population, \nincidence of treating patients with uncontrolled or undiag-\nnosed hypertension is very high. This places the implant cli-\nnician at risk because intraoperative hypertensive episodes \nmay result in cardiac arrhythmias with possible myocardial \nischemia issues, which may lead to possible cardiovascular \nevents such as myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular \nevents.\nClassiication of Hypertension\nIn February 2014 the members of the eighth Joint National \nCommittee (JNC8) on high blood pressure issued new guide-\nlines for the treatment and management of high blood pres-\nsure in adults (Table 2.1). This report redeined treatment \ngoals and thresholds for initiating treatment as well as a \nreevaluation of many common medications used to treat \nhigh blood pressure.6 For years, medical providers treated \nblood pressure to a goal of 120/80 mm HG based on the \nrecommendations of JNC7. JNC8 examined ive new critical \nblood pressure trials. The most compelling and reproducible \noutcome in all the trials was lowering the diastolic blood \npressure to less than 90, which resulted in fewer cardiac events \nand a reduction in overall mortality.\nAdditionally, JNC8 examined the medications used to \ntreat blood pressure and concluded irst-line treatments \nshould be limited to four classes of medications; angiotension-\nconverting enzyme inhibitor (ACEs), angiotension receptor \nblockers (ARBs), thiazide-type diuretics, and calcium channel \nblockers (CCBs). The implant clinician must have a thorough \nTABLE 2.1 Blood Pressure Treatment Guidelines\nCategory\nSystolic \n(mm Hg)\nDiastolic \n(mm Hg)\nTREATMENT\nPreoperative\nIntraoperative\nIdeal\n<120\n<80\nNone\nNone\nPrehypertension\n120–139\n80–89\nRecheck, possible MD consultation\nRecheck, stress reduction protocol\nGrade 1 hypertension\n140–159\n90–99\nRecheck, possible MD consultation, \n(relative)\nMonitor, stress reduction protocol\nGrade 2 hypertension\n160–179\n100–109\nRecheck, MD consultation, (absolute)\nMonitor, discontinue procedure, possible\nER referral\nHypertensive crisis\n>180\n>110\nRecheck, emergency care, (absolute)\nMonitor, abort immediately, emergency \ncare"

With hypertensive patients the \nblood pressure should be controlled before and during elec-\ntive dental implant treatment. Because blood pressure often \nrises prior to dental and surgical procedures, a preoperative \nstress control protocol is mandatory (Box 2.1).\nMonitoring. Accurate assessment of intraoperative vital \nsign monitoring is extremely crucial to prevent complications. \nIf elevated blood pressure (Stage 2) is present, postponement \nor medical consultation is indicated. When measuring blood \npressure in the ofice, adhere to the following:\n• Allow the patient to sit for 3 to 5 minutes prior to obtain-\ning blood pressure measurements.\n• If blood pressure is elevated, recheck after 5 minutes, \nchanging arms.\n• Automatic blood pressure machines may report inaccu-\nrate readings in patients with a history of cardiac arrhyth-\nmia such as atrial ibrillation, which may also cause an \nerratic heart rate. Multiple measurements of the blood \npressure should be taken, and if a signiicant variation \nexists, the blood pressure should be checked manually \nwith a stethoscope and sphygmomanometer.\n• Position cuff at the patient’s heart level and make sure the \ncuff is snug, approximately 3 cm above the elbow.\nMaintain antihypertensive therapy. Patients under a phy-\nsician’s care with antihypertensive medications should be \ninstructed to comply with their medication protocol, espe-\ncially the morning of surgery. If patients do not maintain \ntheir medication protocol, inherent intraoperative vital sign \nluctuations may result. A patient should never alter any phy-\nsician prescribed medication unless otherwise instructed by \ntheir physician.\nSlow administration of local anesthetics. Control of \npain and anxiety is paramount in patients with hypertension \nbecause endogenous catecholamines (adrenaline and norepi-\nnephrine) are released in response to pain and stress. Cate-\ncholamines increase blood pressure and cardiac output, \nthus placing the patient at risk of a stroke or cardiac arrest. \nSlow administration and aspiration of local anesthetics con-\ntaining epinephrine also will minimize potential complica-\ntions. High blood pressure levels may have direct effects on \ncardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial \nACE inhibitors, ARB inhibitors, and beta blockers, which \nmay modify prostaglandin-dependent pathways more than \ndrugs that alter non–prostaglandin-sensitive pathways such \nas calcium channel blockers and central acting drugs. There-\nfore, the interaction with hypertensive medications and \nNSAIDs result in a higher propensity to increase blood pres-\nsure.7 Studies have related approximately 50 million patients \nare being treated with antihypertensive therapy, and 12 \nmillion use NSAIDs concomitantly. However, the short-term \nuse of NSAIDs has not been shown to have a clinically \nsigniicant effect.8\nBeta blockers. The implant clinician must take into con-\nsideration that beta blockers may potentiate the cardiovascu-\nlar effects of epinephrine used in local anesthetics. The \nnonselective beta-adrenergic drugs, such as propranolol \n(Inderal) and nadolol, pose the greatest risk of adverse inter-\nactions.9 The cardioselective beta blockers (Lopressor, Tenor-\nmin) carry less risk of adverse reactions. However, there is \ncompetitive clearance through the liver between both classes \nof beta blockers and the local anesthetic. This may lead to an \nincrease in serum levels of the local anesthetic.10 To avoid \nintraoperative hypertensive episodes, decreasing the dose and \nincreasing the time interval between epinephrine-containing \ninjections is recommended.11\nCalcium channel blockers. These medications used to \ntreat hypertension or congestive heart failure may lead to \ngingival hyperplasia around natural teeth or implants (similar \nto Dilantin). Additionally, this drug classiication has been \nassociated with erythema multiforme (a benign rash charac-\nterized by patches of red raised skin) and other types of oral \nulceration. Gingival overgrowth can result in pain, gingival \nbleeding, and dificulty in mastication, especially around \nimplant prostheses. The incidence of gingival hyperplasia is \napproximately 1.7% to 3.8% of patients taking calcium \nchannel blockers.12\nMultiple antihypertensive drugs. Patients with dificult-\nto-control blood pressure may be prescribed multiple classes \nof antihypertensive medications. Even though these patients \nare being treated with various antihypertensive medications, \nthey are prone to possible elevation and spikes in blood pres-\nsure. With these patients, the clinician should seek medical \nevaluation and consultation, which may include a postopera-\ntive blood pressure–monitoring plan.\nSusceptibility to other cardiovascular events. Severe \nhypertension or elevation in blood pressure may lead to \nangina pectoris, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarc-\ntion, retinal hemorrhage, or even a cerebrovascular episode. \nThese conditions may be precipitated by a rapid increase in \nblood pressure during a local anesthetic injection or the \ninherent stress associated with the surgical procedure. A \nstress reduction protocol is paramount with hypertensive \npatients.\nImplant healing. Cardiac disease (hypertension) may \ntheoretically affect blood supply to the implant site and hence \nreduce survival or success. However, multiple studies have \nshown no evidence of early or late failure in hypertensive \npatients receiving dental implants.13,14\nBOX 2.1 Stress Reduction Protocol\n• Premedication the night before a procedure (longer-acting \nbenzodiazepine [diazepam 5–10 mg])\n• Early morning appointment\n• Explain entire procedure in detail\n• Sedation (Oral/IV)\n• Minimize waiting-room time\n• Duration of treatment not to exceed patient’s tolerance\n• Profound local anesthesia\n• Slow/aspiration LA administration\n• Suficient postoperative pain management\nIV, intravenous; LA, local anesthetic."

Chest pain at rest or with minimal \nexertional activity can also be classiied as unstable angina. \nUnstable angina or a myocardial infarction in the last 6 \nmonths would be an absolute contraindication to the use of \nlocal anesthetics with vasoconstrictors.\nComplication Implication\nPostnitroglycerin issues. Nitroglycerin is a vasodilator that \nincreases the blood supply to the heart and may lower systemic \nblood pressure. The net effect reduces the workload and oxygen \ndemand of the heart, relieving chest pain. The side effects of \nnitroglycerin are important to recognize because the overall \ndecrease in blood pressure may cause a decreased blood low to \nthe brain. Flushing of the face and shoulders along with severe \nheadache is common. After administration, fainting is possible; \ntherefore the patient should be sitting or lying in a supine posi-\ntion. As the heart attempts to compensate for decreased blood \npressure, the pulse rate may increase to as much as 160 beats/min.\nComplication Prevention\nDecrease dental procedural stress. It is important to \nminimize factors that can increase the heart rate, increase \nblood pressure, and subsequently increase myocardial oxygen \ndemand. Stress reduction is critical to reduce catecholamine \nrelease, which may adversely impact the cardiac contributors \nto angina. It is important to initiate a stress reduction proto-\ncol to help alleviate any cardiac stress factors.\nUse of nitrous oxide sedation. Use of sedation, especially \nnitrous oxide (N2O), will reduce the possibility of angina \nattacks. N2O potentially can decrease coronary blood low; \nhowever, studies have shown no cardiac morbidity.15 Use of \nN2O in patients with both a cardiac and pulmonary history \nsuch as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or \nemphysema should be avoided.\nHypertension treatment summary\n• Mild (relative): May undergo most nonsurgical dental \nprocedures performed with normal protocol. General \ncardiac precautions are advised, such as vital signs moni-\ntoring, and patients are instructed to bring their own \nnitroglycerin to their appointment. Advanced restorative \nprocedures and minor implant surgery are performed \nwith stress reduction protocol and sedation.\n• Moderate (absolute): Medical consultation recommended \nfor any elective implant treatment.\n• Severe (absolute): Medical consultation recommended \nfor any elective implant treatment.\nMyocardial Infarction (MI)\npressure. This may result in lowering of the heart rate (bra-\ndycardia), a decrease in blood pressure, and in extreme condi-\ntions cardiovascular failure resulting in cardiac arrest.\nReduction in the use of vasoconstrictors. Especially in \nelderly patients, the indiscriminate use of local anesthesia \nwith vasoconstrictor should be cautioned. Attention should \nbe exercised with patients having a cardiac history, and the \ndose of vasoconstrictors like epinephrine should be reduced \n(<0.4 mg). This may lead to elevation in vital signs in hyper-\ntensive patients, which may possibly lead to cardiovascular \nevents. A rule of thumb is 50% of the recommended \nmaximum dose of local anesthetics can be given after 1 half-\nlife of the local anesthetic.\nAngina\n Do you have chest pain with exertion or have you \nbeen treated for angina? Yes /No?\nAngina is deined as signiicant, painful chest pain as a conse-\nquence of exertion or stress. Angina pectoris is a form of coro-\nnary heart disease that is usually caused by arteriosclerotic heart \ndisease. However, it may be caused by coronary artery spasm, \nsevere aortic stenosis, aortic insuficiency, anemia, emboli, and \nhereditary connective tissue disease. The cause of angina is a \ndiscrepancy between the myocardial oxygen demand and the \namount of oxygen being delivered through the coronary arter-\nies. The classical symptom of retrosternal pain that often radi-\nates to the shoulders, left arm, or mandible or to the right arm, \nneck, palate, and tongue is usually relieved by rest. Patients with \na history of angina may be taking long-acting nitrates to prevent \nthe occurrence of acute episodes. Sublingual or spray nitroglyc-\nerin is recommended for the treatment of acute episodes. When \nretrosternal pain occurs, myocardial infarction is part of the \ndifferential diagnosis. The pain is similar in region but is more \nintense and usually will not cease within 3 to 5 minutes. Risk \nfactors for angina pectoris are smoking, hypertension, high \ncholesterol, obesity, and diabetes.\nSurgical/Implant Implications\nAcute angina attack. In the event of an acute angina \nattack, immediate discontinuation of the surgical procedure \nshould be completed with the administration of nitroglycerin \ntablets (0.3 to 0.4 mg) or sublingual nitroglycerine spray. \nAdditionally, 100% oxygen should be given to the patient \nalong with repositioning in a semisupine (45-degree) posi-\ntion. Vital signs should be monitored with evaluation for \nirregular heartbeats, which could indicate premature ven-\ntricular contractions as a result of myocardial ischemia. If the \npulse remains irregular, medical assistance should be sought.\nStable vs. unstable angina. The difference between stable \nand unstable angina must be understood. Stable angina \nrelates to chest pain that is similar to past episodes of angina \nand is usually brought on by similar amounts of exertion or \nactivity. It usually resolves within several minutes of rest or \ndiscontinuation of exerted activity. Nitroglycerin will most \noften relieve the chest pain.\n Do you have a history of myocardial infarction or heart \nattack? Yes /No?\nMyocardial infarction (MI) is a prolonged ischemia or lack of \noxygen resulting from a deiciency in coronary arterial blood"

The end result \nis cellular death and necrosis of the heart muscle. An acute MI \nmay be precipitated when the patient undergoes unusual \nstress, either physical (painful stimuli) or emotional (anxiety). \nDuring an MI episode the patient usually will be symptomatic \nwith severe chest pain in the substernal or left precordial area \nthat may radiate to the left arm or mandible. Cyanosis, cold \nsweat, weakness, nausea or vomiting, and irregular and \nincreased pulse rate are all signs and symptoms of MI.\nSurgical/Implant Implications\nCardiovascular issues. The intraoperative complications \nof past MI patients include arrhythmias and congestive heart \nfailure (CHF). The larger the ischemic area, the greater the risk \nof heart failure or life-threatening arrhythmias. Any history of \nMI indicates damage to the coronary blood vessels. Therefore, \nrecent infarctions correspond to higher morbidity and death \nrates, even with simple elective surgery. Approximately 18% to \n20% of patients with a recent history of MI will have an \nincrease in complications, which have a high mortality rate of \n40% to 70%.16\nComplication Prevention\nMedical consultation. A medical consultation should \nprecede any extensive restorative or surgical procedure. Even \nthough there are recommendations based solely on the length \nof time after an MI, the deciding factor on elective dental \nimplant treatment is not only time but also the amount of \nmyocardial damage. The implant clinician should follow the \nrecommendation of the physician concerning treatment \noptions, modiications, or contraindications.\nStress reduction protocol. Dental implant surgery after \nMI may induce arrhythmias or aggravate cardiac ischemia. \nAn increased blood pressure is not uncommon in the dental \nofice setting because stress associated with treatment (i.e., \nwhite coat syndrome) leads to increased levels of cate-\ncholamine, which causes an increase in blood pressure and \nheart rate. The most important step in decreasing stress in \nthe dental ofice is to integrate a comprehensive stress reduc-\ntion protocol.\nReduction in the use of vasoconstrictors. Epinephrine \nand other vasoconstrictors have several properties that can \npotentially result in adverse outcomes in patients that have \nnot fully recovered from a recent myocardial infarction. Epi-\nnephrine is chronotropic, which results in an increased heart \nrate and force of contraction. Both of these result in an \nincreased oxygen demand and could potentiate ischemia. \nEpinephrine does have some arrhythmogenic properties that \ncould provoke ventricular ibrillation or tachycardia in recov-\nering myocardial muscle. It is best to minimize complications \nby consulting the patient’s treating physician and closely \nmonitoring vital signs when vasoconstrictors are used.\nMI treatment summary. The patient’s physician should be \nconsulted prior to elective dental implant treatment to verify \nthe patient’s current cardiac status.\n• Absolute (surgical): Recent MI (depending on MD \nrecommendation)\n Do you have a history of cerebrovascular accident \n(stroke)? Yes /No?\nA stroke is a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) characterized by \na sudden interruption of blood low to the brain, causing \noxygen deprivation. It is most frequently seen in patients with \ncurrent cardiovascular diseases and is the fourth leading cause \nof death in the United States and a major cause of adult dis-\nability. The majority of strokes are ischemic resulting from \nnarrowing or blocking of the blood supply to the brain. The \netiology of ischemic strokes is embolic and thrombotic. \nThrombotic strokes are the result of clots that form inside one \nof the brain’s arteries. The clot blocks blood low to the brain \ncausing cell death. Usually, these result from plaque or other \nfatty deposits from atherosclerosis, which break off and become \nlodged in the blood vessel. Embolic strokes are the results of \nclots that form in other parts of the body and travel to the \nbrain via the bloodstream. The clot eventually will lodge in a \nblood vessel and block low of blood to the brain. It is impor-\ntant to ask patients if they have ever been diagnosed or treated \nfor ministrokes or TIAs (transient ischemic attacks). These \nattacks are the result of brief (usually less than 24 hours) inter-\nruptions in blood low causing strokelike symptoms.\nSurgical/Implant Implications\nBleeding. Although it is important to control blood pres-\nsure and treat elevated cholesterol in the management of \nindividuals with a history of strokes, caution should be taken \nbecause most are on blood-thinning medication. Antiplatelet \nagents such as aspirin or clopidogrel may be used as single \nagents or in combination as part of stroke prevention treat-\nment. Both of these medications irreversibly impact platelets’ \nclotting ability and have been shown to cause increased \nbleeding. In some cases warfarin (Coumadin) may also be \nused, which directly interferes with the body’s clotting mech-\nanisms. Evaluation and bleeding control are essential in these \ntypes of patients.\nLimited dexterity. Patients who have suffered a compro-\nmise in dexterity as the result of a stroke require alternative \ntreatment planning for their inal prostheses. A ixed prosthesis \nis usually the best solution for these patients because an implant \nretained prosthesis may lead to the inability to remove for \nroutine hygiene. Additionally, poor oral hygiene when com-\nbined with xerostomia causes additional oral problems such as \ncandidiasis, dental caries, periodontal issues, and mucositis \nlesions, which increase implant prostheses morbidity.\nComplication Prevention\nCurrent anticoagulant medications. The goal of antico-\nagulation medication is to keep the blood thinned so clotting \nis more dificult. However, it is important to understand these \nmedications work by various pathways and can impact"

CHF patients are very sus-\nceptible to intraoperative cardiovascular morbidity issues. \nStress reduction protocol and strict monitoring should be \nfollowed. It is advisable to discuss the current condition of \nthe patient with their treating physician (Box 2.2). Patients \nwith CHF can be classiied as compensated or uncompen-\nsated. In uncompensated heart failure, the pulmonary circu-\nlation is expanded and congested because the heart is unable \nto fully compensate. The classic symptoms are seen including \nshortness of breath especially with exertion, fatigue, or lying \nsupine. When the CHF patient is treated for heart failure \nthrough medical management and the symptoms are con-\ntrolled, the patient is referred to as compensated.\nComplication Prevention\nRecognize CHF symptoms. Although the treatment of \nCHF should be left up to the patient’s physician, it is impor-\ntant to realize that CHF can worsen without warning or \nslowly over time. It is important to evaluate the patient’s \nbreathing at rest and with minimal exertion upon walking, as \nwell as to determine if breathing has worsened when the \npatient is lying down. Changes in any of these patterns of \nbreathing could indicate a decompensation of their conges-\ntive heart failure.

Usually, the more upright the patient, \nthe easier it is for the patient to breathe.\nOxygen supplementation. Oxygen supplementation (≈2 L/\nmin) during implant procedures is highly recommended to \nminimize the possibility of hypoxia.

In patients with \nmechanical heart valves, the upper limit of the therapeutic \nrange can reach 3.5 to 4.0. In patients with artiicial valves, \nthe INR may be checked 24 hours prior to the implant \nsurgery. Under no circumstances should a patient with a \nmechanical valve on Coumadin be instructed to stop or hold \na dose without input from the patient’s treating physician.\nHemostatic agents/surgical technique. Ideal surgical \ntechnique should be followed which consists of nontraumatic \nincision and relection of tissue. The surgical procedures \nshould be minimized with a decreased surgical duration.

Yes\n/No?\nCongestive heart failure (CHF) is a pathophysiologic state in \nwhich an abnormality in cardiac function is responsible for \nfailure of the heart to pump blood in adequate volume to \nmeet the needs of the metabolizing tissues. More than 3 \nmillion people in the United States suffer from CHF, with \napproximately 400,000 new patients being diagnosed each \nyear. Every year 30% to 40% of patients with CHF are hospi-\ntalized, which accounts for the leading diagnosis-related \ngroup of hospitalized patients older than age 65.18\nThe heart pumps approximately 2000 gallons of blood \nper day to other organs and body tissues. It coordinates the \nfunction of two pumps simultaneously: the left side, the \nlarger of the two sides, pushes the blood out into the body; \nthe right side sends the blood to the lungs for oxygenation. \nWhen the heart has been damaged, the blood begins to back \nup in the lungs or body. The heart will attempt to compen-\nsate by increasing the rate of contraction and stretching the \nmuscle to accommodate a larger volume of blood to con-\ntract with a greater force and eject more blood (Frank-\nStarling law). Both of these compensation attempts of the \nheart maintain circulatory needs in the short term; however, \nlong term they may be problematic. Less blood is circulated \nbecause, in beating faster, the heart is left with less time to \nreill, while the extra effort increases the heart muscle’s \ndemand for oxygen. When this need is not met, the heart \nrhythms can become dangerously abnormal (arrhythmic) \nand may lead to death.\n Are you predisposed to infectious endocarditis?

These bacteria \nmay enter the bloodstream and can infect the heart valves. In \ntime the bacteria can destroy heart valves resulting in life-\nthreatening cardiac conditions. For this reason, antibiotic \ncoverage is recommended in high-risk individuals undergo-\ning procedures that may cause these types of bacteremia. The \nguidelines issued in 1997 for endocarditis antibiotic prophy-\nlaxis were very broad.

Yes /No?\nDiabetes mellitus is a major endocrine disorder that affects \napproximately 7% of the population with another 2% to 3% \nundiagnosed. In patients age 60 years or older, 20.9% of all \npeople in this age group suffer from diabetes (approximately \n1 in 5). Approximately 20.8 million children and adults suffer \nfrom diabetes, which contributes to 225,000 deaths per year. \nDiabetes ranks as the sixth leading cause of death in the \nUnited States.21\nThe most current classiication of diabetes includes three \ngeneral clinical categories: type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, \nand gestational diabetes (pregnancy). In type 1 diabetes, \ninsulin is not produced from the pancreas. This type of dia-\nbetes develops most frequently in children. However, the inci-\ndence in the older population is increasing. Type 2 diabetes \nis much more common and accounts for approximately 95% \nof the diabetic cases. This type of diabetes almost always \noccurs in adults and results from the body’s inability to \nrespond properly to the action of insulin, which is produced \nfrom the pancreas. The incidence of type 2 diabetes is esti-\nmated to double by the year 2025 because of aging, unhealthy \ndiets, and obesity.22,23 A recent study revealed a much higher \npercentage of patients with undiagnosed diabetes visiting \ndental clinics than was previously reported.24 An increased \nbody mass index (BMI) and advanced age can be predictors \nof undiagnosed diabetes.

Neuropathy and impaired nerve regeneration may be \naltered as well as angiogenesis.29\nImplant failure. Human clinical studies have indicated \nthat no contraindications exist for patients who are well con-\ntrolled by diet and oral hypoglycemic. However, for insulin-\ncontrolled patients, a contraindication for implants may exist \ndepending on the state of control. Researchers have con-\ncluded that implants have a high success rate provided the \ndiabetes is controlled (monitor to ensure that glycosylated \nhemoglobin [HbA1c] <7.0). An increased failure rate of dental \nimplants has been associated with poor metabolic control.30 \nIt is imperative that uncontrolled or patients exhibiting an \nelevated HbA1c be treated prior to and during the implant \nsurgery healing period.\nComplications Prevention\nUnderstand symptoms of diabetes. Because of the high \nincidence of undiagnosed diabetes, the implant dentist must \nbe aware of the major symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, \npolyphagia, and weight loss. Therefore, undiagnosed diabetic \npatients may predispose the implant procedure with an \nincreased morbidity. In the future, type 2 diabetes will con-\ntinue to grow at rates that may reach epidemic proportions.\nDetermine glycemic control. The glycemic control should \nbe evaluated via HbA1c test, (hemoglobin A1c, glycated hemo-\nglobin, A1c, or HbA1c,) in conjunction with a consultation \nwith the patient’s physician. Ideally, the A1c should be main-\ntained at less than 7% when appropriate. The HbA1c test is \nideal for evaluation of glycemic control because it will show \nthe glycemic control over the past 3 months. The HbA1c \nmeasures the glucose bound to hemoglobin within the red \nblood cells. The test is a weighted average of blood glucose \nlevels during the life of the red blood cells (120 days). This \ntest is more accurate in the assessment of diabetic control in \ncomparison to a fasting blood glucose, which can give a false \npositive or negative results (Table 2.3).\nMedication prophylaxis. Because of the reciprocal rela-\ntionship between infection and glycemic control, the use of \nantibiotic prophylaxis is highly recommended. Ideally, a beta-\nlactam antibiotic should be used pre- and postoperatively. \nWhen antibiotic prophylaxis is administered to diabetic \npatients, studies have shown a 10.5% reduction in failure rate. \nFurther reduction is achieved by maintaining a strict aseptic \ntechnique in combination with good surgical technique. \nAdditionally, it has been reported that the use of a chloro-\nhexidine gluconate (0.12%) rinse at the time of implant \nplacement reduced the failure rate from 13.5% to a remark-\nable 4.4% in type 2 diabetic patients.31 A pre- and postopera-\ntive chlorohexidine regimen will decrease morbidity with \nimplants in diabetics. These patients must practice meticu-\nlous oral hygiene and be recalled at regular intervals to mini-\nmize the possibility of peri-implantitis.\nCorticosteroids use. Even though corticosteroids (e.g., \ndexamethasone) have been shown to minimize edema and \nshould be determined. These symptoms have a higher cor-\nrelation with diabetes and may require additional workup. \nAdditionally, diabetics tend to have a higher prevalence of \nperiodontal disease, caries, and other dental problems such \nas oral candidiasis, recurrent stomatitis, and parotid gland \ndysfunction.25\nSurgical/Implant Treatment Implications\nHypoglycemia. The most serious intraoperative compli-\ncation for diabetic patients is hypoglycemia, which usually \noccurs as a result of excessive insulin level, hypoglycemic \ndrugs, or inadequate food intake. Weakness, nervousness, \ntremor, palpitations, or sweating are all signs of acute hypo-\nglycemia. Mild symptoms can be treated with sugar in the \nform of orange juice or candy. If the symptoms are not \naddressed, they may evolve from minor symptoms to seizure, \ncoma, and in rare cases death. In these severe cases, patients \nmay become unconscious or barely arousable. For these \nsymptoms the emergency administration of 50% IV dextrose \nshould be completed. Additionally, glucagon should be avail-\nable because this hormone may raise blood sugar through a \ndirect effect on the liver. Glucagon may also be administered \nintramuscularly in a dose of 1 mg for adults over 20 kg. \nPatients taking sulfonylurea medications for diabetes (includ-\ning glyburide, glipizide, and glimepiride) who do not have \nadequate carbohydrate intake prior to their procedure are at \nan increased risk of hypoglycemia. It is important that \npatients on these medications follow their regularly pre-\nscribed diet prior to the dental procedure.\nHyperglycemia. The stress of surgery may provoke the \nrelease of counterregulatory hormones that will impair \ninsulin regulation and may result in hyperglycemia and a \ncatabolic state. The cause of hyperglycemia is multifactorial \nand may include any of several medications such as \ncorticosteroids, beta blockers, epinephrine, diuretics, and \nsome antipsychotic drugs. Hyperglycemia is usually slower to \ndevelop and may not necessarily demonstrate any physical \nsymptoms. Patients should be instructed to monitor their \nblood sugars in the postsurgical period and contact their \nphysician if their readings remain elevated from their normal \nbaseline. In the acute setting, hyperglycemia can be treated \nwith insulin or by increasing luids in noncardiac patients. \nEmergency services should be called for patients who experi-\nence erratic breathing and/or luctuating levels of conscious-\nness associated with high blood sugar levels.\nBone formation. Studies have shown hyperglycemia has a \nnegative effect on bone metabolism, reducing bone mineral \ndensity, affecting bone mechanical properties, and impairing \nbone formation leading to poor bone microarchitecture.26 \nThere is a direct correlation between implant osseointegra-\ntion and glycemic control.27 It has been shown that osseoin-\ntegration is more predictable in anatomic areas with abundant \ncortical bone, which is why the mandible has shown a greater \nbone formation than the maxilla.28\nInfection.

Yes /No?\nThyroid disorders are the second most common endocrine \nproblem, affecting approximately 1% of the general popula-\ntion, principally women. The thyroid gland is one of the \nlarger endocrine glands in the body and is situated at the level \nof C5 and T1 vertebral bodies, just below the laryngeal prom-\ninence. The main function of the thyroid gland is to produce \nhormones, the most common being thyroxine (T4) and tri-\niodothyronine (T3). Thyroxine is responsible for the regula-\ntion of carbohydrate, protein, and lipid metabolism. In \naddition, the hormone potentiates the action of other hor-\nmones such as catecholamines and growth hormones. Abnor-\nmalities in the thyroid gland can result in disorders of \nthyroxine production. Excessive production of thyroxine \nresults in hyperthyroidism. Symptoms of this disorder include \nincreased pulse rate, nervousness, intolerance to heat, exces-\nsive sweating, weakness of muscles, diarrhea, increased appe-\ntite, increased metabolism, and weight loss. Excessive \nthyroxine may also cause atrial ibrillation, angina, and CHF. \nPalpation of the patient’s neck often reveals an enlarged \nthyroid gland (goiter) between the cricoid cartilage and the \nsuprasternal notch.\nSurgical/Implant Implications\nHyperthyroidism. High levels of circulating free levels of \nT4 or T3 result in a very low TSH level indicating hyperthy-\nroidism. These patients may also complain of fatigue, and \nusually have excess sweating or feeling of being hot despite \nthe temperature, restlessness, loose stools, palpitations or \nelevated heart rate, weight loss, increased blood pressure, \ntremor, and feeling of nervousness or irritability.\nHyperthyroid: catecholamine sensitivity. Patients with \nhyperthyroidism are especially sensitive to catecholamines \nsuch as epinephrine in local anesthetics. When exposure to \ncatecholamines is coupled with stress (often related to dental \nprocedures) and tissue damage (dental implant surgery), an \nexacerbation of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism may occur. \nThis can result in a condition termed thyrotoxicosis or thyroid \nstorm, which is an acute, life-threatening hypermetabolic \nstate clinically presenting with symptoms of fever, tachycar-\ndia, hypertension, and neurologic and gastrointestinal abnor-\nmalities. Treatment of thyroid storm in the dental setting \nincludes immediate medical attention. If left untreated, these \nsymptoms may result in CHF and life-threatening cardiac \narrhythmias.\nBleeding. The increased blood pressure and heart rate that \naccompany hyperthyroidism may increase bleeding at the sur-\ngical site and require additional hemostatic techniques. It is \nalso important to note that PTU or propylthiouracil is used to \ntreat hyperthyroidism. This drug is an antagonist of vitamin K \nthat has an adverse impact on the clotting cascade and may \nresult in signiicant bleeding or postoperative hemorrhage.\nAspirin/NSAID use. Use of aspirin or NSAIDs requires \nextreme caution in the hyperthyroid patient. Aspirin can \nincrease free levels of the T4 hormone because of an interac-\ntion with protein binding. Additionally, many hyperthyroid \npatients are on beta blockers for heart rate and blood pressure \ncontrol, and the use of NSAIDs can decrease the eficacy of \nbeta blockers. Alternative pain medications should be consid-\nered in patients with hyperthyroidism (e.g., Ultram)."

Cortisol is the main \nsteroid in the body and is involved in metabolic processes, \ninlammatory responses, and the control of responses to \nstresses. Secretion of cortisol is regulated via the hypothalamus-\npituitary adrenal axis (HPA) feedback axis; however, for \npatients who are taking exogenous steroids, the feedback \nresponse may not occur. In these situations, the patient may \nbe predisposed to acute adrenal insuficiency (adrenal crisis).\nSurgical/Implant Implications\nAdrenal insuficiency. Long-term corticosteroid use may \ndecrease a patient’s ability to cope with the stresses of exten-\nsive surgical procedures. This may precipitate an acute adrenal \ncrisis. Patients who are susceptible to adrenal crisis include \nthose who:\n• are currently on daily systemic corticosteroids of 10-mg \nequivalent;\n• are currently on daily systemic corticosteroids of 5-mg \nprednisone equivalent;\n• have been taking corticosteroids regularly during the pre-\nvious 30 days;\n• have been taking corticosteroids for more than 1 month \nduring the past year.33\nSigns of acute adrenal insuficiency include hypotension, \naltered mental status, pallor, and a rapid but steady weak \npulse. Emergency treatment includes terminating the proce-\ndure, summoning medical assistance, administering supple-\nmental oxygen, and monitoring vital signs. Place the patient \nin a supine position and raise the patient’s legs, if possible, to \ncounteract the low blood pressure. If available, administer \n100 mg of hydrocortisone sodium succinate (Solu-Cortef) \nwhen it is clear that the patient’s current symptoms are due \nto adrenal crisis rather than to cardiac, pulmonary, or other \nmedical etiology.\nImplant failure. Long-term corticosteroid therapy has \nshown adverse effects such as reduced bone density, increased \nepithelial fragility, delayed healing (decreased protein synthe-\nsis), and immunosuppression. Animal studies have shown \nosseointegration to be compromised; however, no studies to \ndate have shown increased morbidity or implant failure in \npatients under systemic corticosteroids.34\nComplication Prevention\nSupplemental steroid coverage. For patients who have \nreceived supraphysiologic doses of corticosteroids, their HPA \nmay be suppressed, placing them at risk (adrenal crisis) \nduring dental implant surgery and requiring supplemental \ndoses of corticosteroids. Various regimens have been pro-\nposed; however, the most accepted protocol involves dou-\nbling the normal daily oral dose on the day of the procedure.35 \nModiication of systemic steroid use should only be com-\npleted after physician consultation.\nSusceptibility to infection. Systemic corticosteroids (long \nterm) may compromise the patient’s ability to ight infection. \nBy decreasing leukocytosis, the patient is more susceptible to \ninfection after dental implant procedures. Patients should \nalways receive a prophylactic administration of systemic \nHypothyroidism. Underactive or low thyroid production \nresults in hypothyroidism. This disorder can be caused by the \nthyroid gland not producing suficient thyroid hormone. The \nrelated symptoms are a result of a decrease in metabolic rate, \nwhich cause symptoms such as tiredness, cold intolerance, \nand weight gain. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism or hyper-\nthyroidism can be conirmed with blood tests measuring \nthyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free levels of T4 \nor T3. Low levels of circulating T4 and/or T3 will result in \nthe TSH being elevated, indicating hypothyroidism. These \npatients usually have symptoms of fatigue, dry skin, hair loss, \nconstipation, feeling cold, irregular menstrual cycles, weight \ngain, and they can have an enlarged thyroid gland (goiter).\nHypothyroid: CNS depressants use. The hypothyroid \npatient is particularly sensitive to central nervous system \n(CNS)–depressant drugs, especially narcotics and sedative \ndrugs such as diazepam or barbiturates. The risk of respira-\ntory depression, cardiovascular depression, or collapse must \nbe considered. Patients with longstanding hypothyroidism \nmay have prolonged bleeding requiring hemostatic control \nfor excessive bleeding. Additionally, hypothyroid patients \nmay exhibit delayed wound healing and predisposition to \npostoperative infection.\nHypothyroid: bone healing. T4 affects bone metabolism \nby decreasing recruitment and maturation of bone cells and \nreducing the bone growth factor of insulin-like growth factor. \nStudies have shown that medically treated hypothyroid \npatients exhibit greater bone loss and a less favorable soft \ntissue response after stage I surgery but with no signiicant \nincreased risk of failure.32\nComplications Prevention\nIdeal thyroid control (hypothyroid and hyperthyroid). To \nminimize any possible detrimental effects related to implant \ntreatment, the implant clinician should monitor the patient \nfor ideal thyroid control. Reducing stress in thyroid patients \nalong with patient education on the importance of medica-\ntion control is paramount to decrease procedural morbidity. \nAdditionally, hypothyroid patients should be well informed \nof a possible decreased complication and success rate.\nCorticosteroid Treatment\n Do you have a history of taking corticosteroids? Yes\n/No?\nCorticosteroids are used in medicine today to treat a host of \ndiseases. They are responsible for many actions including \ncarbohydrate, protein, and lipid metabolism, the immune \nresponse, and the body’s response to stress. Corticosteroids \nare highly effective in suppressing or minimizing inlamma-\ntion while their pharmacologic and physiologic mechanisms \nare potentially detrimental to several metabolic, hormonal, \nand immunologic functions in the body. Although corticoster-\noids are routinely used prophylactically in the ield of dental \nimplantology, long-term use for treatment of various diseases \ndoes pose many possible complications for the patient"

Addi-\ntionally, cortical bone loss at the angle of the mandible has \nbeen noted in this disorder.\nXerostomia\nantibiotics (pre- and postoperatively) and an antimicrobial \nmouth rinse (chlorhexidine gluconate) to reduce the possibil-\nity of infection.\nHyperparathyroidism\n Do you have hyperparathyroidsim? Yes /No?\nHyperparathyroidism is an excess of parathyroid hormone \n(PTH) in the bloodstream due to overactivity of one or more \nof the parathyroid glands that maintain calcium balance. The \nclinical manifestations of this disease vary widely depending \non the severity. Mild forms may be asymptomatic, whereas \nsevere hyperparathyroidism can cause bone, renal, and gastric \ndisturbance. It has been noted that skeletal depletion occurs \nas a result of stimulation by the parathyroid gland, which \nresults in alveolar bone being affected prior to bones such as \nthe ribs, vertebrae, or long bones. In the oral and maxillofacial \nregions, altered trabecular bone patterns may be present that \nresult in mobility of the teeth and compromised bone density.\nHyperparathyroidism falls into three categories: primary, \nsecondary, and tertiary. Primary hyperparathyroidism \ninvolves one of the parathyroid glands becoming overactive \nand releasing excess parathyroid hormone. This results in \nhigh levels of calcium being released into the bloodstream \nfrom the bone, which leads to osteoporotic bones.\nSecondary hyperparathyroidism is a chronic condition \nwhere the parathyroid glands release excess amount of para-\nthyroid hormone because of chronically low blood calcium \nlevels. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is usually due to \nconditions such as chronic kidney disease, vitamin D \ndeiciency, and some gastrointestinal issues that impact \ncalcium absorption.\nTertiary hyperparathyroidism can occur when the condi-\ntion causing secondary hyperparathyroidism is treated. This \nis similar to vitamin D deiciency; however, the parathyroid \nglands continue to produce excess parathyroid hormone.\nSurgical/Implant Implications\nBone involvement. Dental implants are contraindicated \n(absolute) in areas of active bony lesions. However, implant \nplacement may be initiated after treatment and healing of the \naffected areas. Altered trabecular bone pattern with the \nappearance of ground glass may also occur. In animal studies, \nsecondary hyperparathyroidism affects alveolar bone more \nthan any other bone of the skeleton, and central or peripheral \ngiant cell tumors may be present in active lesion areas.36\nComplication Prevention\nParathyroid control. When the PTH is elevated, a serum \ncalcium level is obtained to determine if the hyperparathy-\nroidism is primary or secondary, and the condition is usually \ntreated with surgery or medication. In advanced disease, there \nare certain oral changes that can be present to suggest hyper-\nparathyroidism. These patients have an increased risk for tori, \nand reduction in the radicular lamina dura is evident on \ndental radiographs. Many patients with higher levels of \n Do you have xerostomia? Yes /No?\nXerostomia (dry mouth) may directly or indirectly have \neffects on dental implants. A decrease in salivary low is also \naccompanied by a change in its composition. An increase in \nmucin and a decrease in ptyalin result in a more viscous and \nropy saliva. Plaque formation is increased, and the reduced \nantibacterial action of the saliva results in a favorable envi-\nronment for bacteria growth.\nSurgical/Implant Implications\nOral complications. Dental implants are not contraindi-\ncated in patients suffering from xerostomia. Case reports have \nbeen documented with successful implant placement with no \nincrease in failure rate.37 However, with the lack of saliva, \nimplant patients may be susceptible to more oral lesions and \nthe possibility of irritation from tissue-borne implant pros-\ntheses. Additionally, patients are at higher risk for incision \nline opening.\nComplication Prevention\nOral bacterial infections. Patients with xerostomia are at \na higher risk for oral infections such as periodontitis, caries, \nand fungal infections. A comprehensive oral and periodontal \nexamination must be completed with emphasis on a low \nperiodontal pathogen bacterial count to reduce possible post-\noperative complications.\nIncrease saliva low. Stimulation of salivary low may be \nachieved either by physiologic or pharmacologic means. \nMouth rinses, chewing gum, or salivary substitutes may be \nused (Box 2.4).\nBOX 2.4 Xerostomia Treatment Regimens\n• Drink water frequently: helps moisten mucosa and loosen \nmucus.\n• Gum/candy: the use of sugarless gum or candy helps \nstimulate saliva low.\n• Avoid commercial mouth rinses containing alcohol or per-\noxide: further desiccate the mucosa.\n• Avoid salty foods, dry foods (for example, crackers, toast, \ncookies, dry breads, dry meats/poultry/ish, dried fruit, \nbananas) and foods and beverages with high sugar content.\n• Avoid drinks containing alcohol or caffeine.

Emphysema occurs when the alveoli in the bron-\nchioles of the lungs become damaged or destroyed creating \nsymptoms of dyspnea (shortness of breath) that may worsen \nwith mild activity.\nPatients with COPD may have a combination of both \nconditions. These patients usually present with fatigue, \nhistory of recurrent respiratory infections, wheezing, and \nshortness of breath. In advanced disease states, patients may \nbecome oxygen dependent with tachypnea being present with \nsome audible wheezing and shortness of breath even at rest. \nThe various levels of COPD are classiied via GOLD (Global \nInitiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease), which clas-\nsiies patients on their degree of airlow limitation. The \nairlow limitation is measured during pulmonary function \ntests (PFTs) measured as forced expiratory volume (FEV1) \n(Table 2.5).\nSurgical/Implant Implications\nAnesthetic selection. In rare instances, patients with COPD \nreceiving local anesthetics have had adverse reactions. Increased \ndoses of anesthetic solutions that contain sulites may increase \nthe risk of bronchospasm or allergic reactions. Most local anes-\nthetics that are vasopressor anesthetics (e.g., epinephrine, levo-\nnordefrin), will contain the antioxidant sodium (meta) bisulite. \nFor COPD patients with a known allergy to bisulites a local \nanesthetic without a vasopressor (e.g., mepivacaine HCL 3%, \nprilocaine HCL 4%) should be used.\nAdrenal suppression. Adrenal suppression may occur \nwith long-term corticosteroid treatment, which is common \nwith more advanced COPD patients.\nCardiovascular event. For patients who have had a car-\ndiovascular event, the patient’s functional capacity should be \nascertained (physician consultation) and a stress reduction \nprotocol implemented.

Patients should always be instructed \nto bring their rescue inhaler (usually albuterol) to the proce-\ndure or, for more advanced COPD patients, their nebulizer \nand albuterol solution in case of an emergency.\nComplication Prevention\nMinimize elective procedures. Dental implant manage-\nment of patients with COPD is staged according to the sever-\nity of the disease. It is important to understand the severity \nof the lung disease before initiating any dental procedure. \nMore advanced COPD patients have a higher propensity to \nretain carbon dioxide, which may directly lead to adverse \nintraoperative outcomes.\nUse of sedation. Sedation should be carefully evaluated \nin patients with COPD, and discussion with their treating \nphysician is recommended. Potent sedatives such as narcotics \nand barbiturates should be avoided unless approved by the \ntreating physician. These drugs can further depress the respi-\nratory drive in more advanced COPD patients. Antihista-\nmines may desiccate respiratory secretions, which may lead \nto compromised air low. Additionally, nitrous oxide should \nnot be used in COPD patients as it may lead to further respi-\nratory depression (Table 2.6).\nTABLE 2.6 Additional Pulmonary Issues and Treatment Implications\nPositive Response\nTreatment Implications\nAsthma\nInlammatory process in lung is IgE/allergen mediated\nDetermination of trigger: asthma or bronchospasm, including anxiety\nAlbuterol on hand for surgery\nApproximation of severity determined by number of medications and frequency of use \nof albuterol rescue inhaler\nShortness of breath (dyspnea)\nAsthma, COPD, heart disease, cardiomyopathy, CHF, arrhythmias, anemia, obesity, \nheart valve disease\nWheezing\nAllergies, asthma, bronchitis, GERD, vocal cord dysfunction\nHemoptysis (blood in sputum)\nBronchitis, pulmonary embolism, CHF, lung cancer, blood thinners, TB\nCough\nPostnasal drainage, asthma, GERD, ACE/ARB blood pressure meds, chronic bronchitis \nin COPD, other respiratory like bronchiectasis\nChange in exercise tolerance\nAny changes walking up stairs or walking more than 50 yards\nCardiovascular, pulmonary, poor conditioning\nWeight loss\nPoorly controlled COPD, malignancy, TB, hyperthyroid, ethyl alcohol abuse\nDysphagia from stroke or other \nneuromuscular diseases\nRisk of aspiration during dental procedure\nACE, angiotensin-converting enzyme; ARB, angiotensin-receptor blocker; CHF, congestive heart failure; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease; GERD, gastroesophageal relux disease; IgE, immunoglobulin E.\n Do you have a bleeding/blood disorder?

The health concerns associated with polycythemia \nare a direct result of thicker blood due to an increased red \nblood cell count, placing the patient at a surgical risk. Primary \npolycythemia is relatively rare and caused by overproduction \nof red blood cells by the bone marrow. Secondary polycythe-\nmia is caused by chronic hypoxemia or an erythropoietin-\nsecreting tumor. Conditions like COPD, CHF, pulmonary \nhypertension, testosterone replacement therapy, and sleep \napnea may cause secondary polycythemia.\nSurgical/Implant Implications\nThrombus formation. Because of the higher viscosity of the \nblood in polycythemia patients, an increased possibility of \nstroke, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism may occur.\nBleeding. Excessive bleeding and clotting issues are \ncommon with polycythemia patients; good surgical tech-\nnique and strict hemostatic control measures must be adhered \nto in order to minimize intraoperative and postoperative \nbleeding episodes.\nTreatment summary.

    "content": "26\nCHAPTER 2 Medical/Medication Complications in Oral Implantology\nErythrocytic Disorders: Anemia\nAnemia, the most common hematologic disorder, is deined \nas a deiciency in red blood cells, resulting in low hemoglobin. \nThe etiology of anemia is either underproduction of red \nblood cells or an increased destruction or loss (usually gastro-\nintestinal or menstrual) of red blood cells. Iron deiciency \nanemia results from a lack of iron in the body or excessive \nloss of red blood cells. Various other anemias exist that \nare associated with vitamin deiciencies such as B12 or folate. \nSome anemias are the result of destruction of red blood \ncells. These are known as hemolytic anemias with sickle cell \nanemia as an example. Bone marrow dysfunction may also \nlead to anemia.\nThe general symptoms and signs are all a consequence of \neither a reduction of amount of oxygen reaching the tissues \nor alterations of the red blood cell count. The symptoms of \nmild anemia include fatigue, anxiety, and sleeplessness. \nChronic anemia is characterized by shortness of breath, \nabdominal pain, bone pain, tingling of extremities, muscular \nweakness, headaches, fainting, change in heart rhythm, and \nnausea. The general signs of anemia may include jaundice, \npallor, spooning or cracking of the nails, hepatomegaly and \nsplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy.\nSurgical/Implant Implications\nBleeding. Some anemias are associated with abnormal \nbleeding. During extensive surgery, the increased bleeding \nmay cause a decreased ield of view for the clinician and pos-\nsible postoperative issues. Most often iron deiciency anemia \nand other vitamin-dependent anemias are associated with \nincreased bleeding.\nEdema. Increased edema and subsequent increased dis-\ncomfort postsurgically are common consequences. In addi-\ntion, the excess edema increases the risk of postoperative \ninfection and morbidity. Not only are anemic patients prone \nto more immediate infection from surgery, they are also more \nsensitive to chronic infection throughout their lives. This may \naffect the long-term maintenance of the proposed implant or \nabutment teeth.\nOral soft tissue issues. The oral signs of anemia affect the \ntongue. Symptoms include a sore, painful, smooth tongue, \nloss of papillae, redness, loss of taste sensation, and paresthe-\nsia of the oral tissues.\nBone healing. Bone maturation and development are \noften impaired in the long-term anemic patient. A faint, large \ntrabecular pattern of bone may even appear radiographically, \nwhich indicates a 25% to 40% loss in trabecular pattern. \nTherefore, the initial quality of the bone required to support \nthe implant can be affected signiicantly. The decreased bone \ndensity affects the initial placement and may inluence \nthe initial amount of mature lamellar bone forming at the \ninterface of an osseointegrated implant. The time needed \nfor a proper interface formation is longer in poor-density \nbone.38 However, after the implant is loaded successfully, \nthe local strain environment will improve the bone density at \nthe interface.\nComplication Prevention\nMD consultation/lab tests. Lab tests for anemia include \nthe hematocrit and hemoglobin. The hematocrit indicates the \npercentage of a given volume of whole blood composed of \nerythrocytes. An abnormal hemoglobin may result from its \ncombination with substances other than oxygen (e.g., carbon \nmonoxide) or genetic diseases (e.g., sickle cell diseases). \nNormal values for men are 13.5 to 18 g/dL; those for women \nare 12 to 16 g/dL. The minimum baseline recommended for \nsurgery is 10 mg/dL, especially for elective implant surgery. \nFor the majority of anemic patients, implant procedures are \nnot contraindicated.\nMedications. Preoperative and postoperative antibiotics \nshould be administered and the risk of bleeding in anemic \npatients should not be potentiated by the prescription/use \nof aspirin. Hygiene appointments should be scheduled \nmore frequently for these patients to decrease possible \nperiodontal issues.\nLeukocytic (WBC) Disorders\nLeukocyte disorders are an important consideration in hema-\ntologic diseases. The WBC count normally ranges from 4500 \nto 13,500/mm3 in the adult. Leukocytosis is an increase \nin circulating WBCs with various etiologies. There are mul-\ntiple components of the white blood cell that can be increased: \n(1) neutrophils—main defense against bacterial infections; \n(2) lymphocytes—main defense against viral infections; \n(3) monocytes—largest type of leucocyte (white blood cell), \nwhich differentiates into phagocytes; (4) eosinophils—\ncombat parasites and associated with allergies; (5) basophils—\ntype of white blood cell; (6) blast cells—immature cells. \nLeukocytosis is deined as an increase in circulating WBCs in \nexcess of 13,500/mm3. The most common cause of leukocy-\ntosis is infection. Leukemia, neoplasms, acute hemorrhage, \nand diseases associated with acute inlammation or necrosis \n(e.g., infarction, collagen diseases) are more serious causes of \nleukocytosis. Physiologic conditions such as exercise, preg-\nnancy, and emotional stress can also lead to leukocytosis in \naddition to chronic steroid use.\nLeukopenia is a reduction in the number of circulating \nWBCs to less than 4500/mm3. A decreased leukocyte count \nmay accompany certain infections (e.g., infectious hepatitis), \nbone marrow damage (from radiation therapy), nutritional \ndeiciency (e.g., vitamin B12, folic acid), and blood diseases \n(e.g., anemia).9\nSurgical/Implant Implications\nInfection. With patients suffering from leukocytosis or \nleukopenia, many complications can compromise the success \nof the implants and prosthesis. The most common is infec-\ntion, not only during the initial healing phase but also long \nterm, which may compromise the longevity of the implants \nand the inal prosthesis.\nBleeding. Thrombocytopenia is caused by decreased pro-\nduction, increased destruction, or sequestration of platelets \nin the spleen, which results in potential bleeding complica-\ntions during surgery.

The two \nmajor forms of IBD are ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease. \nPatients will usually have symptoms of chronic or severe diar-\nrhea, fatigue, rectal bleeding, and anemia. Ulcerative colitis is \ncharacterized as an inlammatory disease of the rectum and \nlarge intestine mainly affecting the mucosal lining. Crohn \ndisease is an inlammatory disease of the entire digestive tract \nfrom mouth to anus, resulting in lesions of healthy tissue in \nbetween areas of inlammation.

Care should be taken to minimize bleeding.\nOral lesions. There are many differences in the oral \nlesions and that manifest in patients with Crohn disease and \nthose with ulcerative colitis. Many of these patients present \nwith a glossitis, aphthous ulcerations, or a more classic \nmarker of ulcerative colitis, pyostomatitis vegetans. This \ncondition is characterized by pustules with thickened oral \nmucosa and surrounding erythema with some erosions.40 \nUlcerative colitis has extragastrointestinal manifestations \nthat have been associated with erosive temporomandibular \njoint disease.41 Crohn disease has been shown to have \noral symptoms such as cobblestoning of the oral mucosa \naccompanied by ulcerations usually in a linear pattern \nalong with hyperplastic folds of the buccal vestibules \n(mucosal tags).42\nComplication Prevention\nMD consultation. A physician consultation is recom-\nmended to determine the extent of the patient’s digestive \ndisorder along with the current immune status. Most notably, \nan evaluation of delayed wound healing and postoperative \ninfection susceptibility should be ascertained.\nAntibiotics usage. Antibiotics that have a high incidence \nof antibiotic-associated diarrhea or pseudomembranous \ncolitis should be avoided (e.g., amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, \nerythromycin, clindamycin).\nUse of probiotics. Patients with IBD, especially those with \nulcerative colitis, may beneit from the use of probiotics, espe-\ncially when antibiotics are prescribed. Probiotics are live \nmicroorganisms that are added to food to change the intes-\ntinal microbial balance. The mechanism of action is contro-\nversial; however, theories include strengthening of the gut \nbarrier, pathogen growth inhibition, and enhancement of \nmucosal and systemic immune responses.\nPain management. Most NSAIDs may precipitate these \ndisease states and should be avoided unless authorized by a \nphysician.\nStomach Ulcers\n Do you have stomach ulcers? Yes /No?\nApproximately 1 in 10 Americans will suffer from a version of \ngastritis or ulcer disease during their lifetime. Ulcers form when \nthere is a break or breach of the lining of the stomach or intes-\ntine. Peptic ulcers form in the duodenum of the small intestine \nfrom being in contact with stomach acids. Duodenal ulcers are \nthe most common type of ulcer. Ulcers that occur in the \nstomach are referred to as gastric ulcers. In rare cases, esopha-\ngeal relux can cause esophageal ulcers. There are several main \ncauses for ulcer disease including excessive alcohol intake, stress, \nmedications (NSAIDs, aspirin), and a bacterium (H. Pylori).\nComplication Prevention\nMedications. While there are no direct contraindications \nto the use of prophylactic antibiotics in patients with ulcer \n Do you have liver problems? Yes /No?\nCirrhosis of the liver is characterized by irreversible scarring \nand is usually caused by excessive alcohol intake, viral hepa-\ntitis B and C, and certain medications. Although patients \nwith advanced disease can present with jaundice and itching, \nthe diagnosis is usually conirmed by liver biopsy and blood \ntests. Cirrhosis may cause excessive bleeding, mental confu-\nsion, kidney failure, and accumulation of luid in the \nabdomen (ascites). Cirrhosis is irreversible, and transplanta-\ntion is becoming the most successful treatment for advanced \ndisease states.\nThese patients may be predisposed to issues including the \nsynthesis of clotting factors and the inability to detoxify \ndrugs. Hemostatic defects of liver disease are not only the \nreduced synthesis of clotting factors, but also an abnormal \nsynthesis of ibrinogen and clotting proteins, vitamin K dei-\nciency, enhanced ibrinolytic activity, and quantitative and \nqualitative platelet defects. Of patients with liver disease, 50% \nhave a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and possible sig-\nniicant clinical bleeding. The inability to detoxify drugs may \nresult in oversedation or respiratory depression. The labora-\ntory evaluation of the implant candidate gives much insight \ninto hepatic function. A basic panel of liver function tests \n(LFTs) or a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) can \nprovide the needed information. In most patients with liver \ndisease, it is recommended that a complete blood count \n(CBC), LFT, basic metabolic panel (BMP), bleeding time, and \nan international normalized ratio (INR)/PT test should be \nperformed.\nSurgery/Implant Implications\nBleeding. Patients with no abnormal laboratory values \nfor CMP, CBC, partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and PT \nare at low risk. A normal protocol is indicated for all surgical \nimplant procedures. Ideally, INR values should be below 3.0. \nPatients with an elevated PT of less than 1.5 times the control \nvalue or bilirubin slightly affected are at moderate risk. \nChronic severe liver disease may increase INR.\nMedications. Many drugs such as local anesthetics (lido-\ncaine, prilocaine, mepivacaine, bupivacaine), sedatives (loraz-\nepam, valium, alprazolam), and antibiotics (erythromycin, \nclindamycin) are metabolized primarily in the liver. There-\nfore, in some patients a dosage reduction may be warranted \nbased on the current liver functioning.\nNSAIDs. NSAIDs should be avoided because they can be \nassociated with renal failure.

Osteoporosis affects the trabecular \nbone mass loss to a greater extent than it does cortical bone.47\nSurgical/Implant Implications\nSurgical technique. Underpreparation of the osteotomy \nsite (or use of osteotomes) will result in the implant having \nmore bone at the implant interface. Although not contrain-\ndicated, immediate stabilization of dental implants is a \ncommon concern because of decreased trabecular bone mass. \nHealing periods and implant surface characteristics should be \nselected for poorer-quality bone.\nBisphosphonates use. Oral/IV bisphosphonates are com-\nmon medications for osteoporosis. Studies have suggested there \nare different guidelines that should be observed in patients \nreceiving intravenous bisphosphonate treatments in compari-\nson to those patients on oral formulations of these medications. \nWith oral bisphosphonates, a low probability of adverse effects \non the success of dental implants. However, it is advised that a \ndetailed medication history for patients treated for osteoporosis \nbe completed.

For those patients \nreceiving treatment for more than 3 years, additional testing \nmay be considered (C-telopeptide [CTx] test).48 IV forms of \nbisphosphonate medications have been shown to have the most \ndevastating effects within the oral cavity (osteonecrosis), despite \nsimilar mechanisms of action for both the oral and IV formula-\ntions. It is advised that all patients currently treated with \nbisphosphonates be advised of the possibility of bony necrosis \nof the jaw and be part of their informed consent. Intravenous \nadministration of bisphosphonates has been considered an \nabsolute contraindication for placement of dental implants \nwith the concern for the increase risk of developing osteonecro-\nsis of the jaw. This association has been based on patients who \nwere receiving the IV form in treatment of metastatic cancer \nthought is that codeine and opioids should not be used or, if \nso, at very infrequent and lower dosages to avoid hepatic \nencephalopathy.43 Additionally, tetracycline, erythromycin, \nand metronidazole should never be used in patients with \nadvanced liver disease.\nComplication Prevention\nHigh risk (absolute). Patients with a PT greater than 1.5 \ntimes the control value, mild to severe thrombocytopenia (plate-\nlets lower than 50,000/mL), or several liver-related enzymes or \nchemicals affected (bilirubin, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, \nserum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, and serum glutamic \npyruvic transaminase) are at high risk. If there are any concerns, \nconsultation with the patient’s physician should be completed.\nStrict attention to hemostasis. Hemostatic agents should \nbe used, such as bovine collagen or topical thrombin, in addi-\ntion to good surgical technique and placement of additional \nsutures.\nBONE DISEASES\nOsteoporosis\n Do you have osteoporosis? Yes /No?\nThe most common disease of bone metabolism the implant \nclinician will encounter is osteoporosis, an age-related disorder \ncharacterized by a decrease in bone mass, increased microarchi-\ntectural deterioration, and susceptibility to fractures. The World \nHealth Organization deines osteoporosis as bone mineral \ndensity levels more than 2.5 standard deviations below the \nmean of normal young women.44 Forty percent of postmeno-\npausal women in the United States have bone mineral density \nlevels denoting osteopenia, and 7% have scores correlated with \nosteoporosis.45 As the population ages, the incidence of osteo-\nporosis will continue to increase in both women and men.\nThe osteoporotic changes in the jaws are similar to those \nin other bones in the body.

The radiographic appearance is a \npoorly deined, radiolucent area with isolated fragments of \nbone (sequestra) that can exfoliate or become surrounded by \nbone (involucrum). This disorder can be caused by odonto-\ngenic and periodontal infections, trauma, dental implants, \nimmunocompromised states, and hypovascularized bone. The \ntreatment includes aggressive surgical drainage, with possible \nintravenous antibiotic intervention. Osteomyelitis usually \noccurs in the mandible and is rarely seen in the maxilla, most \nlikely due to the increased vascularization of this area.\nSurgery/Implants Implications\nImplant placement. Implant placement in surgical sites \nthat have been previously affected with osteomyelitis leads to \nan increased morbidity. Because of the lack of vascularity, \nendosseous implants have a greater chance of bone loss, \ninfection, and failure.\nTreatment summary. Osteomyelitis is usually an absolute \ncontraindication unless the etiologic factors are corrected and \n Do you have ibrous dysplasia? Yes /No?\nFibrous dysplasia (FD) is a rare, nonheritable, genetic disor-\nder characterized by normal bone being replaced by imma-\nture, haphazardly distributed bone and ibrous tissues. The \netiology of this bone disease is a gene mutation that prevents \nthe differentiation of cells within the osteoblastic formation. \nFD can be further classiied to involve one site (monostotic \nibrous dysplasia [MFD]), multiple sites (polyostotic ibrous \ndysplasia [PFD]), or multiple locations (craniofacial ibrous \ndysplasia [CFD]). CFD lesions are usually unilateral and \noccurs twice as often in the maxilla vs. mandible. The diag-\nnosis of CFD should be determined from the clinical evi-\ndence, histopathologic analysis of the biopsy specimen, and \nradiologic indings.51 Most individuals with this disorder are \ndiagnosed early in childhood.\nSurgical/Implant Implications\nPostoperative healing. Healing after trauma in patients \nwith FD is much different than for those with normal \nbone. The tissue is hypocellular, which leads to slow healing \nand an increased infection rate. These local infections may \nspread through the bone and result in more advanced \ncomplications.\nComplication Prevention\nProper diagnosis. The radiographic appearance is highly \nvariable because of the disproportionately mineralized tissue \nand ibrous tissue in the lesion. This variability results with \nradiographic images depicting the typical “ground glass” \nappearance to early-stage radiolucencies and late-stage radi-\nopacities.52 Additionally, severe malocclusion, dental abnor-\nmalities, and facial asymmetry have been shown to be highly \nprevalent in CFD patients, which further complicates the \nprosthetic rehabilitation of these patients.53\nInformed consent. Because of the lack of research and \nstudies, the patient needs to be well informed of possible \nmorbidity and complications.\nTreatment summary\n• Active lesion areas: Absolute contraindication\n• Nonlesion areas: Relative contraindication\nPaget Disease\n Do you have a history of Paget disease?

However, autoimmune diseases are \namong the most poorly understood diseases, with symptoms \nextremely variable among individuals.\nSjögren Syndrome\nSjögren syndrome is an autoimmune disease in which \nimmune cells attack and destroy exocrine glands that produce \nsaliva and tears. This disorder affects an estimated 4 million \npeople in the United States, with a gender distribution of 90% \nfemale. The average age of onset for the disease is in the late \n40s. The classic symptoms of Sjögren syndrome are xerosto-\nmia and xerophthalmia (dry eyes). Sjögren syndrome often \naccompanies other immune diseases including rheumatoid \narthritis and lupus.\nSystemic Lupus Erythematosus\nSystemic lupus erythematous is a chronic, potentially fatal \nautoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks \ncells and tissue in almost any part of the body. This disease \nusually affects women, and approximately 5 million people \nare aflicted with this disorder. Lupus presents and progresses \nwith such variability that every case is different. Lupus can \naffect almost any part of the body including the kidneys, \nbrain, blood vessels, heart, lungs, and skin.\nThe hallmark sign of lupus is a butterly-shaped rash that \noften appears around the nose and extends to the cheeks. \nSome patients only develop the rash and this is termed discoid \nlupus. Oral ulcerations may be found in patients with lupus \nas well as silvery white (honeycomb) and raised keratotic \nplaques referred to as verrucous lupus erythematous. There \nis no cure for lupus, and most patients are treated with \ncorticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs.\nScleroderma\nScleroderma is a rare, chronic disease characterized by exces-\nsive deposits of collagen that cause musculoskeletal, pulmo-\nnary, and gastrointestinal involvement. The most common \nsymptom is the hardening of the skin in which scarring can \ntake place. Scleroderma can be localized or systemic. The local-\nized version only impacts the skin, whereas the systemic version \naffects the skin, blood vessels, and major organs. Many patients \nalso have concurrent symptoms of Raynaud phenomenon, \nwhich involves ingers and toes and results in vasoconstriction \nof blood vessels in response to cold. Esophageal motility issues \nare also common in the more systemic version. There is no cure \nfor scleroderma, and various stages of the disease are treated \nwith NSAIDs and immunosuppressant drugs.54\nRheumatoid Arthritis\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, inlammatory auto-\nimmune disease that causes the patient’s immune system to \nattack the muscles and joints of the body. This disorder is \nknown for its painful and disabling inlammation, which \nleads to substantial loss of mobility and dexterity. Rheuma-\ntoid arthritis is treated with a wide range of medications \nincluding disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, antiin-\nlammatory drugs, and analgesic medications.55 Rheumatoid \nresorption and deposition of bone. This disease is usually \nseen in Caucasian men older than 40 years. The etiology is \nunknown and usually affects the maxillary alveolar ridge \ntwice as frequently as the mandibular ridge. Because of the \nenlargement of the middle one third of the face, the appear-\nance of a “lionlike” deformity is often noted. Diastemas, tooth \nmobility, and bone pain are additional characteristics. Radio-\ngraphically, a decreased radiodensity, large circumscribed \nradiolucencies, patchy areas of coalesced sclerotic bone \n(cotton-wool appearance), and marrow spaces that are \nreplaced by ibrous tissue are observed. This disease has a \nwide spectrum of treatment ranging from no treatment or \nthe use of bisphosphonates. For patients who are symptom-\natic, IV bisphosphonates are usually the preferred treatments. \nThese drugs help decrease further bone breakdown, forma-\ntion, and remodeling.\nSurgical/Implant Implications\nBleeding. During the active phases of this disease, bone \nis highly vascular with the possibility of arteriovenous shunts, \nwhich may cause hemorrhagic complications.\nInfection. Bone areas that are affected by this disorder \nare predisposed to develop osteosarcoma and possible \nosteomyelitis.\nTreatment summary. Oral implants are contraindicated in \nthe regions affected by this disorder or in patients on IV \nbisphosphonates for the treatment of their Paget symptoms. \nFor additional bone disease responses and treatment implica-\ntion see Table 2.9.\nAUTOIMMUNE DISEASE\nTABLE 2.9 Additional Bone Disease \nResponses and Treatment Implications\nPositive Response\nTreatment Implications\nOrthopedic \nprosthetic device\nAntibiotic prophylaxis\nEctodermal dysplasia\nMany studies completed showing \nsuccessful treatment in \nectodermal dysplasia patients\nCemento-osseous \ndysplasia (periapical \ncemental dysplasia)\nBone quality is questionable \nbecause of avascular \ncementum–like lesions (relative \ncontraindication)\nOsteomalacia\nHypomineralized bone, \nquestionable bone quality \n(relative contraindication)\n Do you have an autoimmune disorder?

In tissues, \ncarbon monoxide displaces oxygen from hemoglobin mol-\necules because of its stronger afinity.59 Hydrogen cyanide has \nbeen shown to cause hypoxia in tissues. The adverse effects \nthat smoking has on successful outcomes in implant surgery \nare well documented. Multiple retrospective studies have \nshown that smokers experienced almost twice as many \nimplant failures compared with nonsmokers.60\nSurgical/Implant Implications\nIncreased incision opening. Studies have shown that \nsmoking is directly related to increased incision line opening. \nPossible mechanisms for poor wound healing include the \nvasoconstrictive nature of nicotine; increased levels of ibrin-\nogen, hemoglobin, and blood viscosity; increased platelet \naggregation; and impaired polymorphonuclear neutrophil \nleukocyte function.61 Therefore, added sutures along with \ntension-free closure is recommended.\nInfection. Tobacco smoke decreases polymorphonuclear \nleukocyte activity, resulting in lower motility, a lower rate of \nchemotactic migration, and reduced phagocytic activity. \nThese conditions contribute to a decreased resistance to \ninlammation and infection.62\nImplant/bone grafting failure. Metaanalysis studies have \nshown a deinite correlation between smoking and failure \nrates of implants and bone grafts.\nPeri-implantitis. Studies have shown in smokers a strong \ncorrelation between peri-implantitis and dental implants.\nComplication Prevention\nInformed consent. With the possible detrimental effects \nof smoking on implants, it is recommended that patients be \ninformed in detail about the risks of smoking. These possible \nconsequences include increased marginal bone loss after \nimplant placement and the presence of peri-implantitis. \nAdditionally, there is a direct impact on the success rates of \nbone grafts, with almost double the failure rate in implants \nplaced in grafted maxillary sinuses.\nSmoking cessation. A strong recommendation on \nsmoking cessation before implant surgery is recommended \nbecause smoking cessation after implant surgery has been \nshown to improve implant survival.63 Ideally, the patient is \ninstructed to cease smoking for 2 weeks before surgery to \nallow for reversal of increased blood viscosity and platelet \nadhesion. Smoking cessation is continued for 8 weeks after \nimplant surgery, which coincides with the osteoblastic phase \nof bone healing.64 This has been shown to increase wound \nhealing capabilities and reverse subgingival microlora.65\nIdeally, smoking cessation should be a gradual process \nbecause withdrawal symptoms are less severe in patients who \narthritis patients in general are immunocompromised by \nassociated medication treatments.\nSurgical/Implant Implications\nImplant surgery. Certain medications may contraindicate \nimplant surgery (steroids, immunosuppressive medications). \nSpecial care should be taken to inquire about the amount of \nNSAIDs the patient utilizes for daily pain control prior to \nsurgical treatment because bleeding complications could \noccur. In patients with RA is important to get a comprehen-\nsive history of medications they are taking. Most current \ntreatment regimens for rheumatoid arthritis involve the use \nof immunosuppressive medications.\nBone resorption and bleeding. There appears to be a dif-\nference in patients who have isolated RA and those with RA \nassociated with other connective tissue diseases. In patients \nwith RA and other connective tissue diseases there is some \nevidence leading to increased bone resorption and higher \nbleeding rates.\nXerostomia. RA patients are more susceptible to decay \nand having the mucous membranes become atrophic and \nfriable. Because of the lack of salivary secretions, complica-\ntions may arise with the use of a tissue-borne prosthesis. A \nixed prosthesis is highly recommended.\nTreatment summary. In contrast to isolated RA, in RA \npatients with concomitant connective tissue disease (CTD), \ndifferences in the periimplant parameters such as pronounced \nmarginal bone resorption and bleeding may be anticipated \nand appear to be signiicantly inluenced by the patients’ \nunderlying disease.56 Medical consult and evaluation should \nbe conducted prior to any treatment.\nComplication Prevention\nFinal prosthesis. Because of the high incidence of xero-\nstomia with autoimmune diseases, the inal prosthesis should \nbe non–tissue-borne (FP-1, FP-2, FP-3) to minimize any soft \ntissue coverage. In patients with limited dexterity, an over-\ndenture (RP-4, RP-5) is contraindicated because of inability \nto remove attachment-secured overdenture.\nMD clearance/informed consent.

Yes /No?\nEthyl alcohol is one of the most widely used mood-altering \ndrugs in the world. Approximately 17 million adults aged 18 \nand older have an alcohol use disorder. This is more common \nin men than women. Many with alcohol dependence disor-\nders go undiagnosed. Because of the adverse impact of alcohol \non dental implants, screening for undiagnosed alcohol-\nrelated disorders is beneicial. Excessive alcohol intake has \nbeen associated with surgical and dental implant-related \nissues such as liver and metabolic dysfunction, bone marrow \nsuppression resulting in bleeding complications, predisposi-\ntion to infection, and delayed soft tissue healing.67\nSurgical/Implant Implications\nBleeding problems. Alcohol interferes with coagulation on \nmultiple levels leading to decreased platelet production \n(thrombocytopenia), impaired platelet function (thrombocy-\ntopathy), and diminished ibrinolysis. Patients who abuse \nalcohol are more susceptible to intra- and postoperative bleed-\ning complications associated with dental implant surgery.\nInfection. Alcohol use leads to signiicant alterations of \ncell-mediated immune systems. Alcohol-induced immuno-\nsuppression results in a decrease in delayed-type hyper-\nsensitivity (DTH), which is a preoperative indicator for \npostoperative infectious complications.68 Therefore, patients \nconsuming alcohol (especially those who consume it imme-\ndiately after surgery) are more susceptible to incision line \nopening and infection.\nIncreased bone loss. Alcohol use also leads to decreased \nbone formation, increased resorption, and decreased osteo-\nblast function, resulting in decreased bone density and inte-\ngration issues. The use of alcohol has a direct effect on \ndental implant healing as studies have shown greater mar-\nginal bone loss and implant failure associated with alcohol \nconsumption.\nComplication Prevention\nInformed consent/decrease comorbidities.

Because of this lower energy radiation and associated \nhigher destructive radiotherapy, progressive endarteritis has \nbeen shown to take place, which increases over time.72\nAmount of radiation exposure. The presently available \nliterature states that implant placement surgery may be com-\npleted on patients who have been irradiated at doses lower \nthan 50 Gy.73 Unfortunately, very few patients receiving doses \nabove 50 Gy have been rehabilitated with implants.\nStudies have shown that implants placed in patients with \na cumulative radiation effect of 18 to 20 (approximately 48 \nto 65 Gy standard fractionation) have a rather high success \nrate. Other reports have shown that doses above a cumulative \nradiation effect of 40 (approximately 120 Gy standard frac-\ntionation) exhibit a high degree of failure.74\nHyperbaric oxygen. One treatment proposed to mini-\nmize the possibility of ORN is the use of hyperbaric oxygen. \nProphylactic hyperbaric oxygen has been advocated to \nincrease oxygen tension in irradiated bone, which will \npromote capillary angiogenesis and bone formation.75 Recent \ndata show that oxygen under hyperbaric conditions acts syn-\nergistically with growth factors, which stimulates bone growth \nand turnover and also may act as a growth factor itself. \nHyperbaric oxygen has also been shown to act as a stimulator \nof osseointegration by increasing new bone formation, \nincreasing bone turnover, and increasing the vascular supply \nto irradiated bone.76\nAGE RELATED FACTORS\nAdolescents\nRadiation Therapy\naMedical consultation, hyperbaric oxygen, informed consent, \naseptic technique (<20 Gy cumulative, approximately <50 Gy \ntechnique fractionation).\nbRadiation therapy medical consultation, possible >20 years ago \nreferral to cancer institution or hospital treatments, for 90 minutes \nbefore placement followed by 10 minutes after placement.\nBOX 2.5 Treatment Protocol for Implant \nPlacement in Radiation Sites\n• For sites that have been previously treated with radio-\ntherapy, the authors recommend referral to a dental school, \nhospital, or clinic that has experience in treating radio-\ntherapy patients.\n• If the clinician has experience or can treat the associated \ncomplications, the following is recommended:\nIdeal Implant Placement:\n• Preradiation: more than 14 days before radiation\n• During radiation: absolute contraindicationb\n• Postradiation: <6 month or >24 months—relative/abso-\nlute contraindication\n• 6–24 months: relative contraindicationa\n Have you ever received radiation therapy? Yes /No?\nAlthough the survival rate of patients with head and neck \ncancer has increased over the last 20 years, it still remains one \nof the deadliest forms of cancer. Aggressive treatment includes \nsurgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or a combination therapy \nthat inevitably leaves the patient with compromised anatomy \nand physiologic functioning. Patients are left with many dei-\ncits including oral mucositis, xerostomia, compromised \nhealing, and reduced angiogenesis. This is a direct result of \nchanges in the vascularity and cellularity of hard and soft \ntissue, damage to the salivary glands, and increased collagen \nsynthesis that results in ibrosis. Because of these detrimental \neffects on the bone, wound repair and healing are signii-\ncantly reduced after surgical procedures. When exposed to \nhigh levels of radiation, bone undergoes irreversible physio-\nlogic changes that include narrowing of the vascular channels \n(endarteritis), diminished blood low, and loss of osteocytes. \nIn time the bone becomes nonvital, which leads to limited \nremodeling and healing potential.\nSurgical/Implant Implications\nOsteoradionecrosis. The most signiicant risk in placing \nimplants into irradiated bone is osteoradionecrosis (ORN), \nwhich is an irreversible devitalization of irradiated bone that \nis characterized by necrotic, soft bone that fails to heal prop-\nerly. The pathophysiologic mechanism is an imbalance in \noxygen demand and oxygen availability, which is caused by \nendarteritis of the blood vessels. Clinical symptoms include \npain, exposed necrotic bone, pathologic fractures, and sup-\npuration. Studies have shown the overall incidence of ORN \nafter radiotherapy to be from 3% to 22%.69\nRadiotherapy to previously placed implants. There are \nvery few studies on the effects of radiotherapy on preexisting \ndental implants. Short-term data show very minimal compli-\ncations and failures. However, in longer-term studies, failure \nrates seem to be higher.70 At this time, more studies need to \nbe conducted for conclusive results.\nImplant placement after radiotherapy. The time between \nradiotherapy to implant placement seems to have effects on \nthe prognosis of implants. Most studies have shown that the \nlonger the period for implant placement after radiotherapy, \nthe higher the success rate and the lower the risk of osteora-\ndionecrosis (Box 2.5).71\nIrradiation patient prosthetics. Because of the oral \neffects of radiotherapy (mucositis, xerostomia), an implant-\nsupported prosthesis (FP-1, FP-2, FP-3) is recommended over \na soft tissue prosthesis (RP-4, RP-5). This will reduce the \npossibility of soft tissue irritation that is associated with \npostradiotherapy patients wearing removable prostheses.\nComplication Prevention\nPast radiation treatment.

No age-related surgical issues exist unless sys-\ntemic contraindications or psychologic issues.\nImplant. If placement is completed before craniofacial \ngrowth is complete, possible interruption of facial growth \nand esthetic (infraocclusion or labioversion) issues can result.\nComplication Prevention\nEarly consultation. In determining the ideal time for \nimplant placement, the patient/family must be educated on \ncraniofacial growth in comparison to chronologic age. \nChronologic age is a poor indicator of dental development/\nfacial growth; timing of implant placement should coincide \nwith growth cessation.\nDetermination of growth cessation. In the literature, there \nexist many methods of determining completion of craniofacial/\nskeletal growth: chronologic age, complete dental develop-\nment, voice changes, hand-wrist radiographs, cervical verte-\nbral maturation, and superimposition of lateral cephalometric \nradiographs. The most reliable method and safest (no radia-\ntion exposure) has been shown to be when the patient begins \nto exhibit a lack of growth in stature (<0.5 cm/year).\nCone beam computed tomography evaluation. A compre-\nhensive radiographic evaluation should be completed as close \nto growth cessation as possible. This is most important in the \nmaxillary anterior region and congenitally missing edentu-\nlous sites to determine the ideal implant position for pros-\nthetic longevity. Most likely these edentulous sites will be \ncompromised in bone volume in the vertical and anteropos-\nterior dimensions, thus requiring osseous augmentation \nprior to implant placement. Additionally, intraroot distances \nshould be evaluated via axial cone beam computed tomogra-\nphy (CBCT) slices at the coronal, midroot, and apical areas. \nFor longevity and esthetic requirements, implants should be \nno closer than 1.5 mm from any tooth structure. The impor-\ntance of this evaluation cannot be overstated, including \npatients who have received adjunct orthodontic care. A \npatient may appear to have adequate space for implant place-\nment in the coronal aspect of the edentulous site, only to have \ninsuficient room in the apical segment due to orthodontic \nmovement.\nTreatment summary. When implants are treatment \nplanned in adolescents, clinicians must take into consider-\nation the timing, site development, esthetics, and possible \nprosthetic limitations including malposition that may develop \nwith age. Most importantly, the determination of growth ces-\nsation should be determined by the lack of growth in stature. \nThis method involves no radiographs (decreased radiation \nexposure) and is the most benign method. The patient’s \n Are you 65 years old or older? Yes /No?\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), most \ndeveloped countries have accepted the chronologic age of 65 \nyears as the deinition of an “elderly” or “older” person.77 The \ntreatment of elderly patients is deinitely challenging, and \nbecause more patients are living longer and are socially active, \nelderly patients will continue to be a signiicant part of the \nimplant dentist’s practice. Studies have shown that elderly \npatients are more prone to systemic diseases, more medically \ncompromised, have potentially longer healing periods, chal-\nlenging bone conditions (quality and quantity), increased \nsusceptibility to drug interactions, and increased dental \nimplant morbidity.\nSurgical/Implant Implications\nDecreased renal function. There is an age-related decline \nin renal functions that is accelerated by comorbid conditions \nlike hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes. The age-related \ndecline is more physiologic while the pathologic decline is \nassociated with many medical conditions. In elderly patients, \nthe glomerular iltration rate (GFR) and creatine will give \ninsight into the patient’s kidney function. As kidney function \ndeclines especially in Stage 3 (GFR 30–59) and above, \nthere is a decreased metabolism and excretion of drugs \n(Table 2.11). Therefore, the intervals between drug adminis-\ntration should be longer and dosages should be decreased, \nexcept for liposoluble drugs and antibiotics, to compensate \nfor the increase in body fat and the reduced immune response. \nIn the presence of signiicant kidney disease (Stage 4 or \nabove), antivirals (acyclovir), beta-lactams (amoxicillin), and \ncephalosporins should be reduced. Nonsteroidal analgesics \nshould not be prescribed in those with Stage 3 or greater \nimpairment without consultation with the patient’s physi-\ncian.

Clinicians must be aware of drug-drug and drug-\ndisease interactions with respect to the patient’s medical \nhistory. Most interactions are related to the potentiation of \nthe sedative and anticholinergic actions of the psychothera-\npeutic drugs. It is important to identify patients taking \nmonamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants. \nAlthough these are no longer the mainstay of treatment for \npsychiatric illness, many patients will be placed on these \nmedications to potentiate the effect of other medications. \nCommon examples include amitriptyline, doxepin, nortrip-\ntyline, and imipramine. These medications are also being \nused to treat nonpsychiatric illnesses and can be used to treat \nchronic pain and sleep disorders. The main concern is the \ninteraction of tricyclic medications and epinephrine because \nthey produce anticholinergic effects on the heart. There is no \ncontraindication to using them together, but patients should \nbe followed more closely for adverse interactions. A physician \nconsult as well as the implementation of a stress reduction \nprotocol are recommended steps to follow when initiating \ntreatment with these patients.\nClenching/Bruxism\nProsthetic treatment. Elderly patients have been shown to \nhave increased dificulty in adapting to inal implant prosthe-\nses. Postinsertion issues such as general adaptation, muscle \ncontrol, hygiene dificulty, tissue inlammation, and overden-\nture seating were signiicant in the older population study. \nPatient education and inal expectations should be discussed \nin detail prior to initiation of treatment.83\nComplication Prevention\nIntraoperative modiications. A strict stress reduction \nprotocol should be adhered to with elderly patients due to the \npotential frailty of their cardiovascular systems. Medication \nmodiications including sedatives and CNS depressants are \nmost important. Because of less competent immune systems, \nbroad coverage with antibiotics is indicated and the use of \nprobiotics should be considered. Elderly patients are less sen-\nsitive to pain, thus less analgesic medication is recommended, \nespecially because gastric motility is reduced in these patients. \nShorter surgical appointments are necessary to minimize \nexceeding patient tolerances.\nTreatment summary. The implant clinician must under-\nstand the physical, metabolic, and endocrine changes and the \neffects associated with the elderly patient before initiating \nimplant treatment. Age is most certainly a prognostic factor \nin implant failure and morbidity. However, increased age is \nnot an absolute contraindication to implant therapy. It is \nimperative the clinician obtain a detailed medical history and \nlist of medications before devising the dental treatment plan. \nPatient education along with modiication in medication use, \nsurgical technique, soft and hard tissue healing times, and \ncareful assessment of postoperative complications must be \nstrictly enforced.\nPSYCHOSOCIAL/STRESS RELATED FACTORS\nPsychological\n Have you had any psychological problems? Yes /No?\nProviding dental implant care to patients with psychologic prob-\nlems is very challenging for clinicians. This group of patients is \nprone to oral health issues because of poor oral hygiene, compli-\nance, and medication effects. Providing comprehensive dental \nimplant care to patients requires good communication skills, \nperseverance, and lexibility in both the surgical and prosthetic \nphases of treatment. Additionally, many patients are on tricyclic \nantidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), \nand monoamine oxidase inhibitors, which are associated with \nmany interactions (see drug interactions). Oral manifestations \nof these diseases and medications include an increase in caries \nand periodontal disease, increased smoking, xerostomia, chronic \nfacial pain, parafunction (bruxism/clenching), and temporo-\nmandibular joint dysfunction.\nSurgical/Implant Implications\nMedications. Many psychotherapeutic drugs interact \nwith medications that are commonly prescribed in implant \n Have you had any issues with clenching or bruxism? \nYes /No?\nParafunctional forces on teeth or implants are characterized by \nrepeated or sustained occlusion and have long been recognized \nas harmful to the stomatognathic system. There are two differ-\nent types of parafunctional phenomena, bruxism and clench-\ning. Bruxism primarily concerns the horizontal, nonfunctional \ngrinding of teeth. The forces involved are in signiicant excess \nof normal physiologic masticatory loads. Clenching is a habit \nthat generates a constant force exerted from one occlusal \nsurface to the other without any lateral movement. The clench \nposition most often is the same and rarely changes from one \nperiod to another. The direction of load may be vertical or \nhorizontal. The forces involved are in signiicant excess of \nnormal physiologic loads and are similar to bruxism in amount \nand duration. A positive feedback loop occurs with patients \nexhibiting parafunction because their muscles of mastication \noften hypertrophy, increasing the magnitude of force that they \ncan produce during function. This leads to an overall musculo-\nskeletal situation that must be closely monitored when initiat-\ning implant treatment with a patient.\nSurgical/Implant Implications\nImplant healing. The most common cause of both early \nand late implant failure after successful surgical ixation is \nparafunction. Such complications occur with greater fre-\nquency in the maxilla because of a decrease in bone density \nand an increase in the moment of force. The lack of rigid \nixation during healing is often a result of parafunction on \nsoft tissue–borne prostheses overlying the submerged implant.\nImplant prosthesis. Parafunctional forces are most dam-\naging when applied to implant prostheses, with lateral (shear) \nforces being the most catastrophic to the components of the"

This will most likely result in screw loosening, \nscrew fracture, or prosthesis fracture.\nComplication Prevention\nOverengineering treatment. When a patient is diagnosed \nas having parafunction, the treatment planning should \ninclude more implants, larger diameter implants, and the \nconcept of progressive bone loading should be adhered to.\nProsthetic design. In an effort to minimize the effects of \nlateral (shear) loads on the implant system, especially in the \nposterior teeth, the clinician should seek restorations with \nnarrow occlusal tables and minimal cusp heights. Further-\nmore, by splinting individual posterior implant units together, \nthe impact of these forces is reduced.\nOcclusal guards. For any patient exhibiting signs or symp-\ntoms of parafunction, a hard, processed acrylic nightguard to \ndissipate the forces to the implant prostheses is paramount to \nprotect the prostheses for long-term success (Table 2.12).\nMEDICATIONS\nOsteoporosis Medications\nTABLE 2.12 Miscellaneous Patient \nResponses and Treatment Implications\nPositive Response\nTreatment Implications\nSinus disease\nPossible sinus pathology leading \nto postoperative morbidity\nFrequent headaches\nAnxiety, migraine sinusitis, \ntemporomandibular joint \ndisorder, anemia\nIntolerance to heat/\nwarm rooms\nHypertension, hyperthyroidism\nSeasonal allergies\nPossible maxillary sinus disease\nPregnancy\nElective treatment (absolute \ncontraindication)\n Have you ever taken bisphosphonates or osteoporosis \ndrugs? Yes /No?\nBisphosphonates\nBisphosphonates are mainly used for the treatment of osteo-\nporosis (oral form) and metastatic cancer (IV form) by induc-\ning osteoclastic death or apoptosis at the cellular level. As an \nosteoporosis drug, they reduce bone resorption via a direct \neffect on the osteoclast. In osteoporotic patients undergoing \nbisphosphonate treatment, old bone is retained because bone \nturnover is suppressed, preventing normal remodeling in this \narea, which results in the formation of brittle bone. Addition-\nally, bisphosphonates kill functionally resorbing osteoclasts not \nonly at the peripheral sites but also in the bone marrow.\nMonoclonal Antibodies\nMonoclonal antibodies work by inhibiting RANKL (receptor \nactivator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand), which is a type II \nmembrane protein that acts as a primary signal for bone \nremoval. They have a direct effect on the immune system and \ncontrol bone regeneration and remodeling. These drug mol-\necules irreversibly bind to mineral matrix in bone and have \na half-life of approximately 26 days, which is much shorter \nthan bisphosphonates (11 years).\nTyrosine Kinase Inhibitors\nTyrosine kinase inhibitors directly inhibit tyrosine kinase \nreceptors such as PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor) and \nTABLE 2.13 Medications Linked to DIONJ\nDrug\nClassiication\nUse\nDose\nRoute\nAlendronate (Fosamax)\nBisphosphonate\nOsteoporosis\n70 mg/week\nOral\nRisedronate (Actonel)\nBisphosphonate\nOsteoporosis\n35 mg/week\nOral\nIbandronate (Boniva)\nBisphosphonate\nOsteoporosis\n150 mg/month\nOral\nZoledronate (Reclast)\nBisphosphonate\nOsteoporosis\n5 mg/year\nIV\nZoledronate (Zometa)\nBisphosphonate\nOsteoporosis\n4 mg/month\nIV\nPamidronate (Aredia)\nBisphosphonate\nOsteoporosis\n90 mg/month\nIV\nDenosumab (Prolia, Xgeva)\nMonoclonal antibody\nOsteoporosis, Cancer\n60 mg/6 months\nSubcutaneous\nBevacizumab (Avastin)\nMonoclonal antibody\nMetastatic cancer\n100–400 mg/14 days\nIV\nSunitinib (Sutent)\nTyrosine kinase inhibitor\nCancer\n5 mg/year\nIV\nEtidronate (Didronel)\nBisphosphonate\nPaget disease\n300–750 mg/6 months\nOral\nTiludronate (Skelid)\nBisphosphonate\nPaget disease\n400 mg daily/3 months\nOral\nSince the irst reported cases of necrotic, exposed bone in \npatients taking bisphosphonates, there has been much \ndebate over treatment implications with regards to dental \nimplants. Bisphosphonates are a group of drugs that are \nwidely used for several bone disorders and have been \napproved by the US Food and Drug Administration for \ntreatment of osteoporosis, metastatic bone cancer, and Paget \ndisease. However, what was once termed bisphosphonate \nosteonecrosis has now been renamed drug-induced osteone-\ncrosis of the jaws (DIONJ) by the American Medical Associa-\ntion. The reason for this is the incidence of osteonecrosis \ncases involving additional drug classiications such as mono-\nclonal antibody drugs, antiangiogenic drugs, and tyrosine \nkinase inhibitors (Table 2.13)."

A comprehensive medical history is \nessential before any elective treatment is initiated. The \nmost important history of bisphosphonates is the use of \nintravenous nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates such as \npamidronate (Aredia) and zoledronic acid (Zometa) and \nnew osteoporotic drugs, which have very limited data on the \nassociation with DIONJ.\nBisphosphonate drugs. In the dental setting, the most \ncommon bisphosphonates that implant dentists are exposed \nto will most likely belong to the family of oral nitrogen-\ncontaining bisphosphonates such as risedronate, ibandro-\nnate, and alendronate. The latest studies show that oral \nbisphosphonates has a very low probability of causing osteo-\nnecrosis.86 However, because of the long half-life and short \nduration of the studies (3 years), future long-term complica-\ntions may be less evident. With this in mind, the implant \ndentist should be cautioned regarding the possibility of devel-\noping osteonecrosis side effects. The risks vs. beneits of \ndental treatment must be discussed with the patient in detail. \nA well-documented consent form is recommended with pos-\nsible medical consultation if the patient has been on this \nmedication for more than 3 years.\nReclast. As stated, most drugs used to treat osteoporosis \nare oral, nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate drugs. Recently, \nReclast (IV: Zoledronate) is given in 5-mg intravenous doses \nonce a year. Studies have shown that a signiicant risk occurs \nafter the fourth yearly dose. This is due to the accumulation \nof the medication and its 11-year half-life. Elective dental \nimplant surgery or bone graft surgery are best scheduled 9 \nmonths after the most recent Reclast dose and 3 months \nbefore the next planned dose. However, at this time, very little \nresearch has been conducted on the relationship between \nReclast and DIONJ.\nComorbidities. Comorbidities are systemic diseases, \nmedical conditions, medications, gender, and age, all of which \ncan predispose the patient to a greater chance of developing \nDIONJ. Many chemotherapeutic drugs, diabetes, immune \ndiseases, anemia, smoking, obesity, female gender and renal \ndialysis have been noted as comorbidities for DIONJ. Addi-\ntionally, the use of glucocorticosteroids may be contraindi-\ncated in patients taking the DIONJ medications discussed \nabove because these drugs have been associated with an \nincreased occurrence of osteonecrosis.\nNew therapies for osteoporosis. One of the newest thera-\npies for osteoporosis is a biyearly subcutaneous injection of \ndenosumab (Prolia). This is a human monoclonal antibody \nthat functions as a RANK ligand inhibitor. Inhibition of the \nRANK ligand results in diminished osteoclast functional and \nbone resorption. Denosumab recognizes the speciic protein \nthat normally activates osteoclasts, thus inhibiting their acti-\nvation and preventing them from breaking down bone. \nDenosumab has also been used to treat metastatic bone \ndisease. These inhibitors do not bind to bone, and their \nVEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), which regulate \ncellular replication in both tumor angiogenesis and tumor \ncell proliferation. Inhibiting these receptors reduces tumor \nvascularization, leading to tumor shrinkage and death.\nSurgical/Implant Implications\nDiagnosis of DIONJ. Marx has deined characteristics of \npatients who are diagnosed as having DIONJ. These include: (1) \ncurrent or previous treatment with a systemic drug that affects \nbone homeostasis, (2) exposed alveolar bone in the jaws that \npersists for more than 8 weeks, (3) no history of radiotherapy \nto the jaws, and (4) no known diagnosis of osteopetrosis or \ncemento-osseous dysplasia. The deinitive symptom of DIONJ \nis bone exposure in the mandible or maxilla that does not heal. \nPain and inlammation is present with possible secondary infec-\ntion of the soft tissue. In severe cases, drainage and progressive \nextension of bone involvement or sequestration results.84\nActive lesions. Osteonecrosis may remain asymptomatic \nfor weeks and possibly months. Lesions usually develop \naround sharp, bony areas and previous surgical sites, \nincluding extractions, retrograde apicoectomies, periodontal \nsurgery, and dental implant surgery. Symptoms include pain, \nsoft tissue swelling, infection, loosening of teeth, and drain-\nage. Radiographically, osteolytic changes are seen, and tissue \nbiopsy has shown the presence of actinomyces, which is pos-\nsibly caused by secondary infection.\nComplication Prevention\nCTx test. It has been proposed that assays to monitor \nmarkers of bone turnover may help in the diagnosis and risk \nassessment of developing bisphosphonate-associated osteo-\nnecrosis. CTx are fragments of collagen that are released \nduring bone remodeling and turnover. Because bisphospho-\nnates reduce CTx levels, it is believed that serum CTx levels \ncan be a reliable indicator of risk level. The CTx test (also \ncalled C-terminal telopeptide and collagen type 1 C telopeptide) \nis a serum blood test obtained by laboratories or hospitals \n(ICD9 diagnostic code 733.40). However, today, the use of the \nCTx test to determine the possibility of osteonecrosis is \ncontroversial.85,85a\nCTx Value\nRisk for DIONJ\n300 to 600 pg/ml (normal)\nNone\n150 to 299 pg/ml\nNone to minimal\n101 to 149 pg/ml\nModerate\nLess than 100 pg/ml\nHigh\nDrug holiday. Marx has suggested a preoperative protocol \nfor administering possible DIONJ drugs to patients who are \nundergoing oral surgical procedures. This protocol takes into \nconsideration the type and duration of drug use as well as \nradiographic and clinical risk factors. Depending upon the \nlaboratory values obtained, a “drug holiday” may be indi-\ncated, which includes temporary interruption of bisphospho-\nnate treatment. However, improvement of bisphosphonate \nlevels may not be observed because measurable levels have \nbeen shown to persist in bone for up to 12 years after cessa-\ntion of therapy.84"

A brief periprocedural inter-\nruption of warfarin therapy is associated with a low risk of \nthromboembolism (0.7%) and risk of clinically signiicant \nbleeding (1.7%); however, the risk vs. beneit of interruption \nis not warranted in most cases.87\nComplication Prevention\nMD consultation. Practitioners should consult with the \npatient’s physician to determine the most recent INR before \nthe surgery (ideally 24–48 hours before surgery). If the INR \nvalues are within the therapeutic range (2 to 3.5), there is no \nneed to discontinue use of the anticoagulant. If the INR value \nis above the therapeutic range (especially higher than 4.0), \nthe physician should take appropriate steps to lower the INR \nto a safer level or possibly discontinue the warfarin and sup-\nplement with heparin therapy or vitamin D. It is important \nto remember with all anticoagulant patients, special attention \nshould be given to good surgical technique and use of appro-\npriate local measures to control bleeding (hemostatic agents).\nAspirin\nAspirin or salicylic acid has been used as an antiinlamma-\ntory, analgesic, and antipyretic medication. However, in the \n1980s it was discovered that aspirin also had an antiplatelet \neffect at very low doses (0.5 to 1 mg/kg) vs. higher doses \nneeded for an antipyretic effect (5 to 10 mg/kg) and antiin-\nlammatory response (30 mg/kg). Because of this research, \nlow-dose aspirin has become a secondary preventive drug for \npatients who have cardiovascular and peripheral vascular \ndisease. Aspirin works by inhibiting the formation of prosta-\nglandin thromboxane A2 within the platelet, thus affecting \nthrombus formation by irreversibly decreasing platelet \naggregation.\nSurgical/Implant Implications\nBleeding. With aspirin there is a risk of potential bleeding \nfrom low platelet count. Studies have shown that this risk is \nminimal unless a 325-mg aspirin is being used. In a study of \ntooth extractions, 36 patients were randomized to 325 mg of \naspirin or placebo for 2 days before and 2 days after. There \nwas no signiicant association between those that took the \naspirin and peri- or postoperative bleeding.88\nComplication Prevention\nLow dose (81 mg). There exists no study supporting the \nrecommendation of low-dose (<100 mg) aspirin discontinu-\nation for routine dental implant procedures. In most patients, \ninterruption is not warranted because it may expose the \npatient to the risk of developing thromboembolism, myocar-\ndial infarction, or cerebrovascular accident.\nHigh dose (325 mg). When patients are advised by their \nphysician to take 325-mg aspirin or doses higher than 100 mg, \na physician consultation is recommended. This is especially \ntrue of patients on aspirin (any dose) with other anticoagu-\nlants such as clopidogrel or dipyridamole. Bleeding times \nmay be appropriate in these patients in combination with \nphysician consultation.\nimpact on bone remodeling decreases after treatment is \nstopped. Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been observed in \npatients receiving denosumab, and all patients should receive \nan oral exam prior to therapy. The risk of developing osteo-\nnecrosis of the jaw is less studied in denosumab.\nTreatment summary\n• Oral bisphosphonates: Relative contraindication (informed \nconsent, good surgical technique, CTx test, drug holiday)\n• IV bisphosphonates: Absolute contraindication; Reclast: \nrelative contraindication\n Have you ever taken anticoagulants? Yes /No?\nOral antithrombotic medications have been used successfully \nto treat a variety of thrombotic diseases such as myocardial \ninfarction, stroke, and deep venous thrombosis, while also \nhaving frequent use in the prevention of cardiovascular dis-\neases. For decades, clinicians and patients have been con-\nscious of the adverse side effects of these medications, \nprimarily spontaneous or perioperative bleeding. Many have \nadvocated for years to temporarily discontinue these medica-\ntions prior to invasive dental treatments such as dental \nimplant surgery. However, because discontinuation of these \ndrugs may result in serious thrombus complications, a thor-\nough knowledge of the mechanism of action needs to be \nunderstood (Table 2.14).\nWarfarin Sodium\nWarfarin sodium (Coumadin) is used as an anticoagulant in \na wide range of conditions such as ischemic heart disease, \ndeep venous thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, and artiicial \nheart valves. Warfarin sodium has a half-life of 40 hours, \nwhich has been known to vary among individuals from 20 to \n60 hours. The mode of action of warfarin sodium is the inter-\nference of the synthesis of vitamin K, which is a cofactor in \nmany reactions within the coagulation cascade. Coumadin \nhas been the mainstay of anticoagulant treatment options; \nhowever, in the past 3 years there has been a shift to a new class \nof blood thinners in the treatment of nonvalvular atrial ibril-\nlation and deep venous thrombosis. With an aging population \nthe number of individuals diagnosed with nonvalvular atrial \nibrillation continues to climb with over 2 million Americans \nnow undergoing treatment. The major concern of atrial ibril-\nlation is the formation of blood clots, so most of these patients \nwill be maintained on blood-thinning medications.\nSurgical/Implant Implications\nMedication modiication. Until recently most medical \npractitioners have believed that anticoagulants should be dis-\ncontinued before dental surgery to prevent possible bleeding \nproblems. However, there exist many documented cases of \nembolic complications in patients who discontinue the use \nof warfarin sodium and develop thrombosis from rebound \nhypercoagulability. In addition, studies have shown that \ndental surgery may be performed safely on patients receiving \nanticoagulant therapy as long as their INR values are within"

The literature does not support the \nroutine discontinuation of this medication in relation to \ndental implant treatment, but it is important to remember \nthat many patients treated with clopidogrel will be on \naspirin or another antiplatelet medication, especially those \nwith cardiac stents. This regimen should never be discon-\ntinued unless under the recommendation of a physician.\n• Pradaxa, Xarelto, Eliquis: Orally administered anticoagu-\nlants have recently been developed to eliminate the disad-\nvantages associated with warfarin. Dabigatran etexilate \n(Pradaxa) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto) have been shown to \nhave a more favorable (wider) therapeutic index, fewer \ndrug-drug and drug-food interactions, and a predictable \nanticoagulant response without the need for anticoagulants. \nDabigatran reversibly inhibits thrombin, so the duration of \naction is predictable and correlates well with plasma drug \nconcentrations. Rivaroxaban is a factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor \nthat produces reversible inhibition of FXa activity.89\nSurgical/Implant Implications\nBleeding. In contrast to the many studies on oral surgery \nand the use of warfarin, no clinical trials have been completed \nto offer recommendations on the management of patients on \nthese newer anticoagulants with relation to dental implant \nsurgery. However, there exist several case studies suggesting \nthat, with physician consultation, these drugs can be tempo-\nrarily discontinued 24 hours prior to elective oral surgery and \nrestarted the following day, resulting in minimal complica-\ntions. Because of these drugs have a short half-life, brief inter-\nruption is usually acceptable. It is imperative that physician \nconsultation be obtained prior any of these medications \nbeing temporarily discontinued. Good surgical technique and \nthe use of hemostatic agents should be adhered to.\nTreatment summary. Currently, there is no accepted \nreduction protocol for these medications. Based on the infor-\nmation available, the clinician should consult the patient’s \nphysician concerning the proposed implant procedure and \nthe invasiveness of the surgery, anticipated hemostasis com-\nplications, and amount of bleeding to be expected. If physi-\ncian recommendation is for the temporary discontinuation \nof these drugs, the typical discontinuation recommendation \nis for 24 hours prior to surgery, and the drug should not be \nrestarted until the risk of postoperative bleeding is minimal \n(usually within 24 hours of surgery).90\nHerbal Supplements\nOver-the-counter herbal and dietary supplements are being \nconsumed at a record pace for general health improvement \nand treatment of chronic conditions.

Therefore, \npatients are susceptible to increased infectious episodes, \nintraoperative bleeding, and compromised bone healing.\nComplication Prevention\nMedical consultation. A medical consult and evaluation is \nhighly recommended prior to any proposed implant treatment. \nFor most chemotherapeutic medications, concurrent use and \nthe placement of implants is an absolute contraindication. Addi-\ntionally, patients on long-term corticosteroid use should be \nevaluated for possible adrenal insuficiency symptoms.\nTreatment summary\n• Past chemotherapy: Relative contraindication after MD \nconsultation\n• Concurrent chemotherapy + implant therapy: Absolute \ncontraindication\nTitanium Allergies\nare usually used to minimize rejection of transplanted organs \nand tissues and also for treatment of autoimmune diseases. \nThese drugs have many side effects, with the majority of them \nacting nonselectively (acting on normal cells also). There are \nfour classes of immunosuppressive drugs: glucocorticoids \n(prednisone), cytostatics (chemotherapeutic agents), antibodies \n(polyclonal antibodies), and immunophilins (cyclosporine).\nGlucocorticoids\nGlucocorticoids have potent antiinlammatory and immuno-\nsuppressive properties. Because these drugs are widely used \nin the treatment of inlammatory and autoimmune diseases, \nspecial attention must be given to patients who are on long-\nterm, high doses of glucocorticoids. These drugs impair many \nhealthy anabolic processes in the body and suppress the \nimmune system, which can lead to severe complications in \ndental implant patients.\nCytostatics\nCytostatics are common medications in the treatment of \nmalignant disease. These drugs cannot discriminate between \nmalignant and normal tissues and become cytoxic to normal \ntissue. Most chemotherapeutic agents are known to have \ncytoxic effects on bone, especially on grafted bone where the \nblood supply is compromised.92 Because chemotherapeutic \nagents have a high afinity for cells that have a high turnover \nrate, the oral mucosa is often affected. These mucosal ulcer-\nations have been known to become secondarily infected.\nSeveral studies have shown that cyclosporine may nega-\ntively inluence bone healing around dental implants and \nmay even impair the mechanical retention of dental implants \npreviously integrated in bone.93\nTamoxifen\nTamoxifen is a standard treatment for hormone receptor–\npositive breast cancer in premenopausal women. Because \ntamoxifen mimics the effects of estrogen, it has a very benei-\ncial side effect that preserves bone mass and prevents bone \nloss. However, there exist drug-induced osteonecrosis con-\ncerns with the administration of this drug. However, studies \nshow a very low prevalence.94\nAromatase Inhibitors\nIn postmenopausal women diagnosed with estrogen receptor–\npositive breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors are the mainstay \nof adjuvant therapy. These medications inhibit the conver-\nsion of androgens to estrogens, which results in estrogen \ndeiciency and may accelerate bone loss. There has been an \nassociation with an increase in drug-related osteonecrosis of \nthe jaws with this class of medications.95 However, in patients \non aromatase inhibitors the incidence of osteonecrosis is still \nsigniicant, and consultation with the treating physician \nshould be considered in these patients.\nSurgery/Implant Implications\nAdverse effects. Some of the most frequent side effects \nof chemotherapeutic drugs are bone marrow suppression, \n Do you have a titanium allergy? Yes /No?\nTitanium has been regarded as a biocompatible and inert \nmaterial, though some studies have shown the material may \nencourage hematologic and metabolic toxicity.96 Titanium \nalloys are commonly used in oral implantology because of \ntheir high strength, biocompatibility, and corrosion resis-\ntance. The most common titanium alloy, TiAl6V4, usually \nwill contain many traces of other elements such as beryllium, \ncobalt, chromium, copper, iron, nickel, and palladium. These \nimpurities are thought to potentially initiate type IV hyper-\nsensitivity allergic reactions.\nMany case reports have shown dental implant–related \nallergic reactions that have resulted in dermal inlammatory \nreactions such as facial eczema, dermatitis, and rashes, along \nwith localized erythema.97 Sensitivity to titanium alloy has \nbeen characterized by the presence of macrophages and T \nlymphocytes, with the absence of B lymphocytes.98 Studies \nhave shown the incidence of this phenomenon to be approx-\nimately 0.6%.99 Other reports have conirmed titanium aller-\ngies associated with pacemakers, surgical clips, and hip \nprostheses.100 It is also important to note allergies to other \nmetals because there has been some suggestion that allergy \nto other metals may increase the risk of a titanium allergy. \nThis would also be of concern in patients who may have had \na reaction to metals in jewelry. In these patients it may be \nadvisable to consider additional testing. Unless a patient has \ndirect exposure to titanium through an orthopedic proce-\ndure like hip or knee replacement or through the use of \nscrews or plates to repair fractures, it is unlikely they would \nbe aware of a titanium allergy. One study estimated the \noverall prevalence of titanium allergies to be very low \nat 0.6%.101\nComplication Prevention\nEvaluation of metal allergies. A list of allergies must be \nexamined as part of a thorough medical history evaluation."

Some of the \nmore common interactions involve NSAIDs because these med-\nications reduce the effectiveness of many blood pressure medica-\ntions. The use of NSAIDs with anticoagulants can increase the \nanticoagulant effect and result in gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. \nNSAIDs may increase the GI toxicity of bisphosphonates and \nSSRIs prescribed for patients with mental illness. SSRIs also \ninterfere with the metabolism of codeine and hydrocodone, so \nthe overall analgesic effect may be reduced (Table 2.16).103,104\nMEDICAL CONSULTATION AND CLEARANCE\nOral implantology is a complex specialty with many factors that \nmust be taken into consideration to decrease morbidity and \nincrease the probability of successful treatment. Medical clear-\nance is a necessity with respect to patients who present with \ncomplicated systemic conditions, medications, and predispos-\ning factors that may lead to complications. The implant clinician \nmust relay to the physician all necessary information, including: \n(1) a detailed summary of what the patient related as their \nmedical history, (2) list of all current and recent medications, \n(3) allergies, (4) any medications that will be prescribed by the \nimplant dentist, and (5) the invasiveness of the intended proce-\ndure (Fig. 2.2). The physician will provide answers to;\n1. Most Recent Physical Exam: to determine if the patient is \ncompliant with keeping up with their medical health.\nIf an allergy to titanium is discovered, the treatment plan \nshould be modiied to test for titanium allergy or possible use \nof zirconia implants. Early study on ceramic implants shows \npromise because they possess good mechanical strength and \nexcellent tissue compatibility and exhibit osseointegration \ncomparable to that of titanium.102\nDRUG INTERACTIONS\n Have you every had a drug interaction? Yes /No?\nIn contrast to many years ago, patients who are seeking \nimplant treatment are older and more medically compro-\nmised. Because of the advancement of pharmaceuticals, \npatients are on a wide range of medications that signiicantly \nincrease the risk for drug interactions. Additionally, because \noral implantology often involves invasive treatment, patients \nwill require local anesthesia with vasoconstrictors, analgesics, \nanxiolytics, corticosteroids, and antibiotics, any of which on \noccasion could adversely interact with a variety of the medi-\ncations they are on. The implant clinician must have a thor-\nough understanding of the most common drugs prescribed \nwith inherent interactions (Table 2.15).\nMost of the reactions are the result of interactions with oral \npain medications and with vasoconstrictors used to enhance \nTABLE 2.15 Most Common Medications Prescribed + Interactions104\n \nInteracting Drugs\nAdverse Effects\nAll Penicillins\nStatic drug will impair action of Penicillin\nBacteriostatic Antibiotics\nMethotrexate (Rheumatrex)\nDecreases secretion of Methotrexate\nAll Cephalosporins\nBacteriostatic Antibiotics\nStatic drug will impair action of Penicillin\nAnticoagulants\nRisk of bleeding disorders might be increased in anticoagulated \npatients\nLincomycins \nClindamycin (Cleocin)\nErythromycin\nPossibility of antagonism.

    "content": "54\nTreatment Planning Complications\nRandolph R. Resnik, Carl E. Misch\n3 \nThe introduction of the dental implant has greatly expanded the \nscope of services that clinicians can provide to restore patients \nto optimal form, function, and esthetics. Patients presenting \nwith missing teeth or pathology that necessitate tooth extraction \nnow have a wide range of treatment options beyond ixed \nbridges or removable prosthetics. The progressive loss of bone \nas a consequence of tooth extraction can now be minimized. \nImplant technology has allowed clinicians to come much closer \nto the ideal goal of restoring patients’ dental health.\nPatients present to dental ofices every day with either an \nedentulous condition or pathology that necessitates tooth \nremoval. Prior to the beginning of treatment, the clinician \nhas an ethical and legal obligation to educate the patient as \nto the advantages and disadvantages of every therapeutic \noption available. The goal of this chapter is to provide clini-\ncians with a comprehensive treatment protocol for the major \nedentulous conditions, including advantages and disadvan-\ntages of each. By informing the patient of each option avail-\nable (including no treatment), the dental professional can aid \nthe patient in forming an educated choice for treatment that \nmeets their needs and values.\nIn this chapter the various aspects of treatment planning \nwill be discussed. These include the prosthesis type, available \nbone, key implant positions, implant size, and force factors.\nTYPE OF PROSTHESIS\nTREATMENT PLANNING\nIn implant dentistry, when a speciic prosthetic result is \ndesired, additional foundation units (support) may be created \nto obtain the end result. Both the psychologic and anatomic \nneeds and desires of the patient should be irst evaluated and \ndetermined. The prosthesis that satisies the intended goals \nand expectations may then be designed.\nComplications often arise when only one implant approach \nis used for all patients because the same surgical and pros-\nthetic scenarios and laws are invariably repeated. The bene-\nits of implant dentistry can be realized only when the \nprosthesis is irst discussed and determined in detail by the \nclinician and patient. An organized treatment approach based \non the prosthesis permits predictable therapy results. Misch \nhas postulated there are basically ive various prosthetic \noptions available in implant dentistry. Three restorations are \nixed and vary in the amount of hard and soft tissue replaced; \ntwo are removable and are based on the amount of support \nfor the restoration.1\nThe amount of support required for an implant prosthesis \nshould initially be similar to that used in traditional tooth-\nsupported restorations. After the intended prosthesis is \ndesigned, the implants and treatment surrounding this spe-\nciic result can be established. The prosthetic option is the irst \nfactor to determine in the overall implant treatment plan.\nNot Understanding and Communicating  \nthe Types of Prostheses\nComplication. When treatment planning for a ixed pros-\nthesis, many inherent complications may occur. It is crucial \nfor the clinician to have a thorough understanding of how \nthe inal ixed prosthesis is directly related to the amount of \nhard and soft tissue remaining, position of the implant, and \nthe anatomic area of the oral cavity. If this is not understood, \nmiscommunication may result leading to possible esthetic, \nbiomechanical, or periodontal issues.\nPrevention\nProsthesis treatment planning irst. To satisfy predictably a \npatient’s needs and desires, the prosthesis should irst be \ndesigned. In the stress treatment theorem postulated by Misch, \nthe inal restoration is irst planned in a way similar to an archi-\ntect designing a building before setting the foundation.2 Implant \ndentistry is analogous to constructing a building. Prior to con-\nstruction, detailed blueprints are obtained that explain in detail \nevery aspect of the project. Similar guidelines should be used in \nimplant dentistry treatment planning. Only after the prosthesis \nis envisioned and determined can the inal abutments, implant \nsize and location, and available bone requirements be deter-\nmined to support the speciic predetermined restoration.\nTreatment plan according to inances. Patients are too often \ntreated as though cost is the primary factor in establishing a \ntreatment plan. Patients should be presented with all viable \ntreatment plans, regardless of cost. To determine the ideal inal \nprosthetic design, the existing anatomy is evaluated after it has \nbeen determined whether a ixed or removable restoration is \nrequired to address the patient’s desires. An axiom of implant \ntreatment is to provide the most predictable, treatment that will \nsatisfy the patient’s anatomic needs and personal desires.\nPatient should be educated on all viable treatment plans. \nIt is the clinician’s obligation to educate the patient on the \nvarious treatment plans that are possible.

It is imperative that \npatients understand the advantages and disadvantages of \neach of these treatment modalities. In this way, patient expec-\ntation complications will be prevented. A good source of \nproviding this information is via presentation books, videos, \nand online information. The education process should be \ndocumented and be part of the patient’s records.\nUnderstand the differences between the types of prosthe-\nses. To prevent treatment planning complications, the \nimplant clinician must understand there are three types of \nixed prostheses and two types of removable prostheses, as \npostulated by Misch in 1989. When evaluating ixed prosthe-\nses, the three options may be used to replace one tooth \nor multiple teeth and may be cemented or screw retained. \nThese types of ixed prostheses depend on the amount of \nhard and soft tissue structures replaced and the aspects of the \nprosthesis in the esthetic zone. Common to all ixed options \nis the inability of the patient to remove the implant prosthesis \n(Table 3.1 and Fig. 3.1).\nFIXED PROSTHESES\nFP-1\nDeinition. An FP-1 is a ixed restoration and appears to the \npatient to replace only the anatomic crowns of the missing \nnatural teeth (clinical crown). To fabricate this restoration \ntype there must be minimal loss of hard and soft tissues. The \nvolume and position of the residual bone must permit ideal \nplacement of the implant in a location similar to the root of \na natural tooth. The inal restoration appears very similar in \nsize and contour to the clinical crown or most traditional FPs \nused to restore or replace natural crowns on teeth (Figs. 3.2 \nand 3.3).\nFIG 3.1 Fixed restorations have three categories: FP-1, FP-2, \nand FP-3. The restoration type is related to the contour of the \nrestoration. (FP-1 is ideal, FP-2 is hypercontoured, and FP-3 \nreplaces the gingiva drape with pink porcelain or acrylic.) The \ndifference between FP-2 and FP-3 most often is related to \nthe high maxillary lip position during smiling or the mandibular \nlip position during sibilant sounds of speech. FP-2 and FP-3 \nrestorations often require more implant surface area support \nby increasing implant number or size. (From Misch CE: Dental \nimplant prosthetics, 2e, St Louis, 2015, Mosby.)\n10 mm\n4 mm\n12 mm\n18 mm\nTABLE 3.1 Prosthodontic Classiication\nType\nDeinition\nFP-1\nFixed prosthesis; replaces only the clinical \ncrown; looks like a natural tooth with ideal \ncontours\nFP-2\nFixed prosthesis; replaces the clinical crown and \na portion of the root; crown contour appears \nnormal in the occlusal half but is elongated or \nhypercontoured in the gingival half\nFP-3\nFixed prosthesis; replaces missing clinical crown \nand gingival color and a portion of the \nedentulous site; most common prosthesis is \nzirconia\nRP-4\nRemovable prosthesis; overdenture supported \ncompletely by implants (usually with a \nsuperstructure bar) that is completely implant \nsupported with no soft tissue support\nRP-5\nRemovable prosthesis; overdenture supported \nby both soft tissue (primary support) and \nimplants, which may or may not have a \nsuperstructure bar (secondary support)\nImplant Criteria. The FP-1 prosthesis is most often desired \nin the maxillary anterior region, especially in the esthetic \nzone during smiling. The inal FP-1 restoration appears to the \npatient to be similar to a crown on a natural tooth. However, \nthe implant abutment can rarely be treated exactly as a natural \ntooth prepared for a full crown. The cervical diameter of a \nnatural tooth is approximately 6.5 to 10.5 mm with an oval-\ntriangular cross-section. However, the implant abutment is \nusually 4 to 5 mm in diameter and round in cross section. In \naddition, the placement of the implant rarely corresponds \nexactly to the crown–root position of the original tooth. For \nexample, the thin labial bone lying over the facial aspect of a \nmaxillary anterior root remodels after tooth loss, and the \ncrest width shifts to the palate, decreasing 40% within the irst \n2 years.\nComplication. The most common complication with a \npatient requesting a FP-1 prosthesis is not recognizing pre-\noperatively the limitations of the hard and soft tissue anatomy."

In a buccal-lingual position, the implant should be \nin a plane slightly lingual to the incisal edge of the tooth being \nreplaced. In the apicocoronal plane, the implant should be \napproximately 3 mm apical to the free gingival margin of the \nadjacent teeth, provided that the adjacent teeth have ideal \nhard and soft tissue anatomy.\nFP-2\nDeinition. An FP-2 ixed prosthesis restores the anatomic \ncrown and a portion of the root of the natural tooth and, there-\nfore, is hypercontoured. The incisal edge of the restoration is in \nthe correct position, but the gingival third of the crown is over-\nextended, usually apical and lingual to the position of the origi-\nnal tooth. These restorations are similar to natural teeth \nexhibiting periodontal bone loss and gingival recession. In most \nsituations an FP-2 is an acceptable prosthesis for patients. \nHowever, in the esthetic zone or in a patient with a high smile \nline, this may pose complication issues because the prosthesis \nmay be deemed unesthetic by the patient (Fig. 3.4).\nImplant Criteria. The volume and topography of the avail-\nable bone are more apical compared with the ideal bone \nposition of a natural root (1–2 mm below the cement-enamel \njunction) and dictate a more apical implant placement com-\npared with the FP-1 prosthesis. This most commonly occurs \nbecause of implant placement in Division B ridges, and \nIf the inal implant position is nonideal, it will be almost \nimpossible to obtain a FP-1 prostheses without hard and soft \ntissue grafting.\nPrevention. The bone loss and lack of interdental soft tissue \ncomplicate the inal esthetic result, especially in the cervical \nregion of the crowns. FP-1 prostheses are especially dificult \nto achieve when more than two adjacent teeth are missing \nbecause of the need for hard tissue augmentation, soft tissue \naugmentation, and optimal implant positioning.\nHard tissue augmentation. The width or height of the \ncrestal bone is frequently insuficient after the loss of multiple \nadjacent natural teeth, and bone augmentation is often \nrequired before implant placement to achieve natural-looking \ncrowns in the cervical region.\nSoft tissue augmentation. Because there are no interden-\ntal papillae in edentulous ridges, soft tissue augmentation is \noften required to improve the interproximal gingival contour. \nIgnoring this crucial step will result in open “black” triangular \nspaces (where papillae should usually be present) when the \npatient smiles.\nIdeal implant positioning. To obtain an FP-1 prostheses, \nthe implant must be positioned ideally in the mesial-distal, \nbuccal-lingual, and apicocoronal planes. The center of the \nosteotomy should be midway between the mesial-distal dis-\ntance, provided the available space is ideal for the tooth being \nFIG 3.2 The Misch prosthesis classiication is dictated by the amount of clinical crown height, \nhard and soft tissue replacement. FP-1 replaces the ideal clinical crown, FP-2 replaces the clinical \ncrown + a hypercontoured replacement of the lost hard and soft tissue, and FP-3 that replaces \nthe clinical crown + signiicant hard and soft tissue replacement (pink porcelain, acrylic, zirconia). \n(From Misch CE: Dental implant prosthetics, 2e, St Louis, 2015, Mosby.)\nFP-1\nFP-1\nFP-2\nFP-2\nFP-3\nFP-3"

The FP-3 ixed restoration appears to replace the \nnatural teeth crowns and has pink-colored restorative mate-\nrial (acrylic or pink porcelain) to replace a portion of the soft \ntissue, especially the interdental papillae. This is most com-\nmonly indicated when severe bone resorption has occurred.\nImplant Criteria. As with the FP-2 prosthesis, the original \navailable bone height has decreased by natural resorption or \nosteoplasty at the time of implant placement. To place the \nincisal edge of the teeth in ideal position for esthetics, func-\ntion, lip support, and speech, the excessive vertical dimension \nto be restored requires teeth that are unnatural in length. The \nsoft and hard tissue loss requires replacement with pink por-\ncelain or acrylic (Fig. 3.7).\nComplication. The main complication associated with an \nFP-3 prosthesis is patient acceptance because of the hyper-\ncontoured crowns (i.e., pink porcelain or acrylic). Addition-\nally, the clinician must be aware of the added laboratory \ncosts associated with an FP-3 prosthesis. Most laboratories \nwill charge a signiicantly higher fee for the application of \npink porcelain. However, the clinician should be aware \nthere exist various shades of pink porcelain. It is recom-\nmended that the color of the tissue be evaluated similar to \ntooth shade. Many pink shade guides are available for use in \nimplant dentistry today (Fig. 3.8).\nPrevention\nPatient communication. The patient should be well \ninformed prior to any treatment that the inal FP-3 prosthetic \nteeth will appear longer and also have pink restorative mate-\nrial associated with the prosthesis to replace the loss of hard \nand soft tissue. Photos or examples of the pink prosthesis \nshould be shown to the patient.\nUnderstanding of smile zone variations. The ideal high \nsmile line (i.e., not showing excessive soft tissue) occurs in \nthe irst premolar and approximately 4% of our patients \ndisplay almost all the maxillary teeth during a smile.3 The low \nlip position is ideally evaluated during sibilant sounds of \nspeech (e.g., Mississippi, sixty-six). It is not unusual for \npatients to show fewer lower anterior teeth during smiling, \nespecially in younger patients. Older patients are most likely \nto show the anterior teeth and gingiva during speech, with \nmen showing more than women. Likewise, if the high lip line \nduring smiling or the low lip line during speech does not \ndisplay the cervical regions, the longer teeth are usually of no \nesthetic consequence, provided that the patient has been \ninformed before treatment (Fig. 3.6).\nIdeal implant position. A multiple-unit FP-2 restoration \ndoes not require as speciic an implant position in the mesial \nor distal position as does an FP-1 prosthesis. This is because \nthe cervical contour is not displayed during function. The \nimplant position may be chosen in relation to bone width, \nangulation, or hygienic considerations rather than purely \nesthetic demands (compared with the FP-1 prosthesis). On \noccasion, because of available bone, the implant may even be \nplaced in an embrasure between the two teeth. This often \noccurs when replacing mandibular anterior teeth with a full-\narch ixed restoration. If this occurs, the incisal two thirds of \nthe two crowns should be ideal in width, as though the \nimplants were not present. Only the cervical region is com-\npromised (i.e., this is most likely out of the esthetic zone). \nAlthough the implant is not positioned in an ideal mesiodis-\ntal position, it should be placed in the correct facial-lingual \nposition to ensure that contour, hygiene, and direction of \nforces are not compromised.\nFIG 3.6 High smile line.

The maxillary lip displays the \ninterdental papilla of the maxillary anterior teeth, but not the \nsoft tissue above the mid cervical regions. A high smile or \n“gummy” smile will usually display the interdental papillae \nand at least some of the gingival tissues above the free gingival \nmargin of the teeth. Patients in both of these categories of \nhigh lip line should have the soft tissue replaced by either the \nprostheses or augmentation. Additionally, the appearance of \nthe mandibular teeth may be evaluated during sibilant sounds \n(Fig. 3.9).\nColor of the pink tissue. Because the color characteristics \nof patient’s gingiva vary greatly, the implant clinician \nshould use a laboratory that has the capability to use a pink \nporcelain shade guide to match the tissue. However, patients \nshould be informed of the tissue color changes that occur \nover time.\nUnderstand the two types of FP-3 prostheses. There are \nbasically two approaches for an FP-3 prosthesis. (1) A hybrid \nrestoration of denture teeth and acrylic with a metal substructure. \nThe complications associated with this type of prosthesis are \nexcessive wearing of the denture tooth or debonding from the \nprosthesis. (2) A porcelain–metal/zirconia restoration. An FP-3 \nporcelain-to-metal/zirconia restoration is more dificult to fab-\nricate for the laboratory technician than an FP-2 prosthesis. \nThe pink porcelain is more dificult to appear as soft tissue and \nusually requires more porcelain iring cycles. This increases the \nrisk of potential porosity or porcelain fracture (Fig. 3.10).\nSpacing of multiple implants. For edentulous arches or \nlarger spaces, implants should be placed a minimum of 3 \nmillimeters apart. If they are less than 3 millimeters apart, \ndificulty with hygiene will result along with the possibility \nthat bone loss on one will extend to the other, compromising \nboth implants.\nTissue space. In the maxillary arch, wide open embrasures \nbetween the implants may cause food impaction or speech \nproblems. These complications may be solved by using a \nremovable soft tissue replacement mask or make the overcon-\ntoured cervical restorations. The maxillary FP-3 prosthesis is \noften extended or juxtaposed to the maxillary soft tissue so that \nspeech is not impaired. However, this results in hygiene issues, \nwhich place the prostheses at risk. The mandibular FP-3 resto-\nrations may be left above the tissue, similar to a sanitary pontic. \nThis facilitates oral hygiene in the mandible, especially when \nthe implant is exposed through the soft tissue drape and is not \nvisible during speech. However, if the space below the restora-\ntion is too great, the lower lip may lack support in the labio-\nmental region."

The difference in the two categories of removable \nrestorations are not in appearance (as it is in the ixed catego-\nries). Instead, the two removable categories are primarily \ndetermined by the amount of implant and soft tissue support \n(Fig. 3.11).\nRP-4\nDeinition. An RP-4 removable prosthesis is completely sup-\nported by implants with no soft tissue support. The RP-4 \nprosthesis is primarily a totally implant-supported prosthesis. \nThe restoration is rigid when inserted, and the overdenture \nattachments usually connect the RP to single implant attach-\nments or a low-proile tissue bar with attachments (Fig. 3.12).\nImplant Criteria. The implant placement criteria for an \nRP-4 prosthesis are different than that for an FP prosthesis. \nDenture teeth and acrylic require more prosthetic space for \nthe removable restoration in comparison to a ixed prosthesis. \nThe implants in an RP-4 prosthesis (and an FP-2 or FP-3 \nrestoration) should be placed in the mesiodistal position for \nthe best biomechanical and hygienic situation. Usually, in the \nmandible, implants are inserted between the two mental fora-\nmens in the A, B, C, D, and E positions.\nComplication. The most common complication occurring \nwith a RP-4 prosthesis is lack of adequate implant support \n(e.g., insuficient number of implants) and food impaction. \nIn the mandibular RP-4 prosthesis, because there exists no \nperipheral seal, often food becomes impacted underneath the \nprosthesis.\nFIG 3.10 FP-3 prostheses. (A) acrylic/denture tooth construc-\ntion; (B) pink porcelain; (C) pink zirconia. \nB\nC\nA\nREMOVABLE PROSTHESES\nWhen treatment planning, the patient’s prosthetic requirements \nshould be fully understood and an evaluation of the patient’s \nanatomy is a priority. The most common removable implant \nprostheses are overdentures for completely edentulous patients. \nComplete removable overdentures have been reported with \npredictability and a high success rate for many decades; however, \nthere is much confusion concerning this type of prosthesis \nbecause of the inherent variations.4,5 Most often, patients do not \nunderstand the associated movement with overdentures (i.e., \ndependent on number of implants, attachments, A-P spread, \nposterior ridge form) because they don’t understand the associ-\nated biomechanical factors with an overdenture prosthesis. The \ncomplications that may a occur may be signiicant.\nThere exist two types of removable prostheses that are \nbased on support, retention, and stability of the restoration. \nFIG 3.11 Removable restorations have two categories based \non implant support. RP-4 prostheses have complete implant \nsupport in both the anterior and posterior regions. In the \nmandible, the superstructure bar often is cantilevered from \nimplants positioned between the foramina. The maxillary \nRP-4 prosthesis usually has more implants and no cantilever \n(usually no palate present). An RP-5 restoration has primarily \nanterior implant support and posterior soft tissue support in \nthe maxilla or mandible. Often fewer implants are required, \nand bone grafting is less indicated.

For a totally implant-supported prosthe-\nsis (RP-4), four to ive implants are required in the mandible \nand six to eight implants in the maxilla. Fewer implants being \nutilized to support a RP-4 prosthesis will result in possible \noverloading of the prosthesis and/or implants leading to \ncomplications.\nRP-5\nDeinition. RP-5 is a removable prosthesis combining \nimplant and soft tissue support. Predominately, the soft tissue \nis the primary support (primary stress-bearing areas) and \nimplants are used for secondary support. The advantage of \nan RP-5 restoration is the reduced cost because fewer implants \nmay be inserted compared with a RP-4 or ixed restoration. \nAdditionally, there is less demand for bone augmentation, \nwhich decreases cost.\nImplant Criteria. Implants in the mandible are inserted \nwithin the mandibular interforaminal space with two, three, \nor four implants. These correspond to the Overdenture Treat-\nment Planning options (e.g., OD-1–OD-5). In the maxilla, \nusually four to six implants are recommended depending \nupon force factors.\nComplication. The most common complication occurring \nwith an RP-5 prosthesis is the associated movement. A \ncommon misconception of patients is they believe that \nimplants, independent of the number, should have no associ-\nated movement. Because an RP-5 relies on the soft tissue for \nsupport, there will be inherent movement within the prosthe-\nsis. Additionally, with an RP-5 prosthesis, because of the \nprimary implant support, soft tissue pressure is present, which \nmay cause sore spots. If a patient’s initial complaint is chronic \nposterior sore spots, an RP-5 is not the best prosthetic option.\nPrevention\nPatient communication. The patient should have a thor-\nough understanding of the differences between an RP-4 and \nan RP-5 prosthesis. A common problem with an RP-5 pros-\nthesis is the possible associated movement, which some \npatients may not tolerate or expect. A preoperative explana-\ntion must allow the patient a full understanding of the advan-\ntages and disadvantages of the two types of prostheses. A \ncommon analogy is the use of a chair. A two-implant over-\ndenture is similar to a chair with only two legs. The chair may \nbe stabilized; however, it can easily be moved. A three-implant \noverdenture is similar to a three-legged chair because it is \nmore stable than two-implant overdenture; however, it will \nstill have some degree of movement. A four- to ive-implant \noverdenture is similar to a four-legged chair, which is associ-\nated with minimal movement (Fig. 3.13).\nTreatment denture. A preimplant treatment denture may \nbe fabricated to determine position and prosthesis thickness. \nPrevention\nPatient communication. The patient should have a thor-\nough understanding of the differences between a RP-4 and a \nRP-5 prosthesis. There exist distinct differences between RP-4 \nand RP-5 prosthesis with respect to number of implants, type \nof support, and prosthesis movement.\nTreatment denture. A preimplant treatment denture may \nbe fabricated to evaluate the occlusal vertical dimension and \nensure the patient’s esthetic satisfaction. This technique is \nespecially indicated for patients with demanding needs and \ndesires regarding the inal esthetic result or with severely \nreduced vertical dimensions with their present prosthesis. \nThe implant dentist may also use the treatment denture as a \nsurgical guide for implant placement and for use during the \nhealing stage. After the implants are uncovered, the super-\nstructure or prosthetic design is fabricated within the guide-\nlines of the existing treatment restoration.\nImplant position. The positioning of implants for an RP-4 \noverdenture is critical to the successful outcome of the pros-\nthesis. For example, a Hader clip requires the mesiodistal \nimplant spacing to be greater than 6 mm from edge to edge of \nthe implant bodies. Because of this space requirement, the \nnumber of implants is reduced, especially if placed between \nthe interforaminal space of the mandible. Additionally, in the \nFIG 3.12 (A) RP-4—totally implant-supported prosthesis with \nno soft tissue support, note the lack of peripheral seal. \n(B) RP-5 prosthesis—soft tissue–supported with secondary \nimplant support and peripheral seal. \nA\nB"

The avail-\nable bone concept describes the amount of bone in the \nedentulous area considered for implantation. Available bone \nis measured in width, height, length, and angulation and \ncrown height space (CHS) in relation to the remaining bone \n(Fig. 3.15). If the bone is inadequate to predictably support \nan implant, a bone graft is considered in the ideal site(s), or \nalternative sites may be considered when additional implant \nnumbers are necessary.\nNot Understanding the Parameters  \nof the Available Bone\nTo avoid complications in assessing the available bone present, \nthe implant clinician must understand the correct parameters \nin determining the bone height, width, and length.\nAvailable Bone Height. The available bone height is irst \ndetermined by radiographic evaluation (preferably cone \nbeam computed tomography [CBCT]) in the edentulous \nregion by measuring from the crest of the edentulous ridge \nto the opposing anatomic landmark. The anterior regions of \nthe jaws have the greatest height due to the pneumatization \nof the maxillary sinus and the inferior alveolar nerve limits \nthis dimension in the mandibular posterior regions. The \nmaxillary canine eminence region, just lateral to the lateral \npiriform rim of the nose, often offers the greatest height of \navailable bone in the maxillary anterior (Fig. 3.16).7\nAs a general rule, the anterior mandible has the greatest \nbone height. There is more bone apical to the mandibular \nanterior teeth than any other region. Even after the resorption \nof the residual ridge after tooth loss, there is usually adequate \nbone to insert dental implants (Fig. 3.17). However, the \ncrown height of the prosthesis may be extensive (e.g., FP-2, \nFP-3) because of the loss of bone. This region often has the \nmost available bone but also may have the greatest crown \nheight space.\nThe anterior bone region in the mandible extends between \nthe right and left mental foramens. The mental foramen is \nmost often found in close proximity to the two premolars. \nThe anterior region of bone extends beyond the canines and \nto the irst premolar region most often. The initial mandibu-\nlar bone height is inluenced by skeletal anatomy, with Angle \nClass II patients having shorter mandibular height and Angle \nClass III patients exhibiting the greatest height.\nThe opposing landmarks for both the maxilla and man-\ndible of the initial available bone height are more limiting in \nthe posterior regions distal to the irst premolar. In the maxil-\nlary posterior jaw region, there is usually greater bone height \nin the irst premolar than in the second premolar, which has \ngreater height than the molar sites because of the concave \nmorphology of the maxillary sinus loor. As a consequence, \nthe existing bone anatomy of the implant patient often \nrequires modiication (e.g., sinus augmentation) to enhance \nlong-term implant success (Fig. 3.21).\nThe posterior height of bone in the mandibular region is \nreduced because of the presence of the mandibular canal, \nsituated approximately 12 mm above the inferior border of \nthe mandible (Fig. 3.18). Generally, less available bone is \npresent in the higher force areas of the posterior mandible \nand maxilla; however, many treatment plans include shorter \nand fewer number of implants.

However, \nbecause of the variable osseous angulation in the anterior mandible, the implant often engages \nthe lingual plate of bone. \nFIG 3.18 The posterior mandible has less bone height \nbecause the variable position of the inferior alveolar canal \nwhich dictates the size and positioning of the implant. \nmanufacturer design, surface characteristic, and type of \napplication.9,10\nThe available bone height in an edentulous site is the most \nimportant dimension for implant consideration because it \naffects both implant length and associated crown height. \nCrown height space directly affects force factors and esthetics. \nIn addition, bone augmentation is more predictable in width \nthan height, so even when the width is inadequate for implant \nplacement, bone grafting may be used to create a site ideal for \nrestorative and implant insertion requirements.\nAvailable Bone Width. The width of available bone is mea-\nsured between the facial and lingual plates at the crest of the \npotential implant site. The crestal aspect of the residual ridge \nin the mandible is often cortical in nature and exhibits greater \ndensity than the underlying trabecular bone regions. This \nmechanical advantage permits immediate ixation of the \nimplant, provided this cortical layer has not been removed by \nosteoplasty.\nThe crest of the edentulous ridge is most often supported \nby a wider base in the anterior mandible. In most mandibular \nsituations, because of this triangular cross-section, an osteo-\nplasty provides greater width of bone, although of reduced \nheight (Fig. 3.19).\nIt should be noted that crest reduction (osteoplasty) affects \nthe location of the opposing landmark, with possible surgical \nconsequences, including implant size selection, implant posi-\ntion, and inal prosthesis design. This is particularly impor-\ntant when a FP-1 prosthesis is planned, with the goal of \nobtaining a normal contour and proper soft tissue drape \naround a single tooth replacement.\nUnlike the anterior mandible, the anterior maxilla often \ndoes not follow the triangular anatomy. The palatal plate \nof bone is more parallel to the facial plate in the maxilla \n(Fig. 3.20). In addition, many edentulous ridges exhibit a \nlabial concavity in the incisor area, with an hourglass conigu-\nration. As a result, osteoplasty does not increase the width of \nbone as much as in the mandible. As a consequence, bone \naugmentation for width is more often indicated in the maxilla."

    "content": "66\nCHAPTER 3 Treatment Planning Complications\nAfter adequate height is available, the next most signiicant \nfactor affecting the long-term survival of endosteal implants \nis the width of the available bone. Root form implants with \ncrestal diameters of 4 mm usually require more than 6 mm \nof bone width to ensure suficient bone thickness and blood \nsupply around the implant for predictable survival. This \ndimension provides more than 1 mm of bone on each side \nof the implant at the crest. Because the bone usually widens \napically in the mandible, this minimum dimension rapidly \nincreases. For root form implants, the minimum bone thick-\nness is located in the midfacial and midlingual contours of \nthe crestal region exclusively (Fig. 3.21).\nAvailable Bone Length. The mesiodistal length of available \nbone in an edentulous area is often limited by adjacent teeth \nor implants. As a general rule, the implant should be at least \n1.5 to 2.0 mm from an adjacent tooth and 3 mm from an \nadjacent implant. This dimension not only allows minor sur-\ngical error but also compensates for the width of an implant \nor tooth that acquires a crestal defect, which is usually less \nthan 1.4 mm. As a result, if bone loss occurs at the crest \nmodule of an implant or from periodontal disease with a \ntooth, the vertical bone defect will not spread to a horizontal \ndefect and cause bone loss on the adjacent structure.11 In the \ncase of a single-tooth replacement, the minimum length of \navailable bone necessary for an endosteal implant depends on \nthe width of the implant. For example, a 5-mm–diameter \nimplant should have at least 8 mm of mesiodistal bone, so \n1.5 mm is present on each side of the implant. A minimum \nmesiodistal length of 7 mm is usually suficient for a 4-mm–\ndiameter implant.\nThe diameter of the implant is also related to the width of \navailable bone and, in multiple adjacent sites, is primarily \nlimited in this dimension. For example, a width of bone of \n4.5 mm without augmentation requires a 3.5-mm or smaller \nimplant, with inherent compromises (e.g., less surface area \nand greater crestal stress concentration under occlusal loads \non abutment screw and marginal bone). In narrow ridges, it \nFIG 3.20 The anterior maxilla most often has the palatal wall \nof bone parallel to the facial cortical plate. Osteoplasty is less \neffective to increase the bone width.

In edentulous areas with a wide ridge, wider root \nform implants may be utilized. Implants may allow up to \n30 degrees of divergence with the adjacent implants, natural \nteeth, or axial forces of occlusion with minimum compro-\nmise. However, angled loads to an implant body increases the \ncrestal stresses to the implant components and bone, but the \ngreater-diameter implant decreases the amount of stress \ntransmitted to these structures. In addition, the greater width \nof bone offers some latitude in angulation at implant place-\nment. The implant body may often be inserted so as to reduce \nthe divergence of the abutments without compromising the \npermucosal site.\nAn acceptable bone angulation in the wider ridge may be \nas much as 30 degrees. The narrow yet adequate width ridge \noften requires a narrower design root form implant. Com-\npared with larger diameters, smaller-diameter designs result \nin greater crestal stress to the system (abutment screws, crestal \nbone) and may not offer the same range of custom abut-\nments. In addition, the narrower width of bone does not \npermit as much latitude in placement regarding angulation \nwithin the bone. This limits the acceptable angulation of \nbone in the narrow ridge to 20 degrees from the axis of the \nadjacent clinical crowns or a line perpendicular to the occlu-\nsal plane (Fig. 3.22).\nCrown Height Space. The crown height space (CHS) is \ndeined as the vertical distance from the crest of the ridge to \nthe occlusal plane. It affects the appearance of the inal pros-\nthesis and may affect the amount of movement force on the \nimplant and surrounding crestal bone during occlusal \nloading. Esthetically, the prosthesis is less likely to replace the \nsole anatomic crowns of natural teeth when a greater CHS is \npresent.\nThe CHS may be considered a vertical cantilever. Any \ndirection of load that is not in the long axis of the implant \nwill magnify the crestal stresses to the implant-bone interface \nand to the abutment screws in the restoration. The greater \nthe CHS, the greater the moment force or lever arm with any \nlateral force or cantilever (Fig. 3.23).\nis often indicated to place two or more adjacent narrow-\ndiameter implants (when possible) to obtain suficient \nimplant–bone surface area to compensate for the deiciency \nin width of the implant. Because the implants should be \n3 mm apart and 1.5 to 2.0 mm from each tooth, 13 mm or \nmore in available bone mesiodistal length may be required \nwhen the narrower implant dimensions are used to replace a \nposterior tooth.\nThe ideal implant mesiodistal width for single-tooth \nreplacement is often related to the natural tooth being \nreplaced in the site. The tooth has its greatest width at the \ninterproximal contacts, is narrower at the cementoenamel \njunction (CEJ), and becomes even narrower at the initial \ncrestal bone contact, which is 2 mm below the CEJ.12 The \nideal implant diameter corresponds to the width of the \nnatural tooth, which may be measured 2 mm below the CEJ \nof the adjacent tooth. In this way the implant crown emer-\ngence (emergence proile) through the soft tissue may be \nsimilar to that of a natural tooth. For example, a maxillary \nirst premolar is approximately 8 mm at the interproximal \ncontact, 5 mm at the CEJ, and 4 mm at a point 2 mm below \nthe CEJ. A 4-mm–diameter implant (at the crest module) \nwould be the ideal if it is positioned at least 1.5 mm from the \nadjacent roots (2 mm below the CEJ).\nAvailable Bone Angulation. Bone angulation is the fourth \ndeterminant for the evaluation of available bone. The alveolar \nbone angulation represents the natural tooth root trajectory \nin relation to the occlusal plane. Ideally, this angulation is \nperpendicular to the plane of occlusion, which is aligned with \nthe forces of occlusion and is parallel to the long axis of the \nprosthodontic restoration. The incisal and occlusal surfaces \nof the teeth follow the curve of Wilson and curve of Spee. As \nsuch, the roots of the maxillary teeth are angled toward a \ncommon point. The mandibular roots lare, so the anatomic \ncrowns are more lingually inclined in the posterior regions \nand labially inclined in the anterior area compared with the \nunderlying roots. The irst premolar cusp tip is usually verti-\ncal to its root apex.\nThe maxillary anterior teeth are the only segment in either \narch that does not receive a long-axis load to the tooth roots \nbut instead are usually loaded at an approximate 12-degree \nangle. As such, their root diameter is greater than the \nmandibular anterior teeth. In all other regions of the mouth, \nthe teeth are loaded perpendicular to the curves of Wilson \nand Spee.\nRarely does the bone angulation remain ideal after the loss \nof teeth, especially in the anterior edentulous arch. In this \nregion, labial undercuts and resorption after tooth loss often \nmandate greater angulation of the implants or correction of \nthe site before insertion (osseous augmentation). For example, \nin the anterior mandible, the implant insertion often engages \nthe lingual cortical plate, rather than the inferior border of \nthe mandible, as a consequence of the position of the incisal \nedge and the angulation of bone. In the posterior mandible, \nthe submandibular fossa mandates implant placement with \nincreasing angulation as it distally progresses. Therefore, in \nFIG 3.22 As bone resorbs from the buccal, the mandible will \nbecome more angled toward the lingual, resulting in an angu-\nlation complication for implant placement."

As a general rule, \nDivision A bone should not be treated with smaller-diameter \nimplants for the inal prosthesis, unless dictated by the spe-\nciic tooth replacement (e.g., maxillary lateral incisors or \nmandibular incisors) (Fig. 3.24). There are several advantages \nto the use of implants equal to or greater than 4 mm in diam-\neter compared with smaller-diameter implants (Box 3.2).\nProsthetic Treatment\nFixed. FP-1 restorations require a Division A ridge. \nHowever, a FP-2 prosthesis most often also requires a Divi-\nsion A bone. A FP-2 restoration is the most common poste-\nrior restoration supported by multiple adjacent implants in \npartially edentulous patients because of either bone loss or \nosteoplasty prior to implant placement. A FP-3 prosthesis is \nmost often the option selected in the anterior Division A \nbone when multiple adjacent teeth are missing and the maxil-\nlary smiling lip position is high, or a mandibular low lip line \nduring speech exposes regions beyond the natural anatomical \ncrown position.\nThe absence of a periimplant ligament means that the \nbone-implant stresses cannot be reduced by increasing the \nimplant height. Therefore, as the CHS increases and a canti-\nlever or a lateral load is planned on the restoration, a greater \nnumber of implants or wider implants should be inserted to \ncounteract the increase in stress. For an ideal treatment plan, \nthe CHS should be equal to or less than 15 mm under ideal \nconditions.\nNot Understanding the Divisions of Bone: \nDivision A (Abundant Bone)\nThe Division A edentulous ridge exhibits abundant bone in \nall dimensions of height, width, and length. Division A root \nform implants are optimal and most often used as indepen-\ndent support for a ixed or removable prosthesis. Division A \nbone is the ideal type of bone to provide a natural looking \nFP-1 prosthesis.\nCriteria Division. Division A bone corresponds to abundant \navailable bone in all dimensions; the height of 12 mm or \nmore, width of >6 mm, angulation <30 mm, and crown \nheight space of <15 mm.

Increases in implant numbers for smaller-\ndiameter implants increase the cost to the patient (and \nclinician).\n• Division A root form implants can provide the greatest \nrange of prosthetic options.\n(From Misch CE: Dental implant prosthetics, ed 2, St Louis, \n2015, Mosby.)\nFIG 3.25 The resorption of bone in the maxilla results in the \nridge becoming more narrow because it resorbs toward the \nmidline.

Complications with Division A bone are \nminimal. The most common complication is not assessing \nthe crown height space, which may impinge on the prosthetic \nrehabilitation. Many clinicians fail to educate the patient \nabout the rapid decrease in bone volume width and the con-\nsequences of delaying treatment. When the bone volume is \nDivision A, there is a decrease in treatment costs, with a \nreduction in the number and complexity of surgeries to the \nedentulous area (Fig. 3.25).\nNot Understanding the Divisions of Bone: \nDivision B (Barely Suficient Bone)\nThe decreased width and surface area usually require addi-\ntional implants to be included in the inal prosthesis design. \nDivision B may be changed to Division A by augmentation \nor osteoplasty. The treatment options may be selected in light \nof the area to be treated. For example, in the anterior maxilla, \naugmentation is most often selected because of esthetics. In \nthe anterior mandible, osteoplasty is common because of the \navailable bone height and low esthetic concerns. In the \nposterior mandible, multiple Division B implants may be \nused when the bone density is favorable, the available bone \nheight is limited, and esthetics are not a primary factor. When \nstress factors are a concern, bone augmentation precedes \nDivision B root form implants regardless of the anatomic \nlocation (Box 3.3).\nAs the bone resorbs, the width of available bone irst \ndecreases at the expense of the facial cortical plate because \nthe cortical bone is thicker on the lingual aspect of the alveo-\nlar bone, especially in the anterior regions of the jaws. This \nmay result in a 25% decrease in bone width the irst year and \na 40% decrease in bone width within the irst 1 to 3 years \nafter tooth extraction.13 The resulting narrower ridge is often \ninadequate for most 4-mm-diameter root form implants \n(Box 3.4).\nRemovable. For removable implant overdentures in Divi-\nsion A bone, the inal position of the tooth and superstruc-\nture bar must be evaluated before surgery. A limited CHS \nis more common in Division A bone, and an RP-4 or RP-5 \nrestoration may require osteoplasty before implant place-\nment. Division A bone may represent a contraindication for \nhigh-proile O-ring attachments or superstructures placed \nseveral millimeters above the tissue. This may result in difi-\nculty in prosthesis fabrication, esthetics, hygiene, adequate \nstrength of the prosthesis."

For example, a width \nincrease of 1 to 2 mm may be obtained with an alloplast and \nguided bone regeneration, but more than 2 mm of width is \nmore predictable with autologous bone as part of the graft.\nComplications\nMore bone augmentation required. The Division B−w \nridge will usually require more than 2 mm of width increase, \nand therefore autologous bone or an autologous/allogenic graft \nis beneicial to predictably grow the additional bone width. If \nthe Division B−w ridge contour requires alteration altered for \nimproved prosthodontic relationships, an onlay particulate or \nblock graft of autogenous bone is indicated. The autograft may \nbe harvested from an intraoral region (e.g., the mandibular \nsymphysis or ramus) and placed along the lateral aspect of the \nridge that corresponds to ideal arch form. The implant place-\nment is usually delayed for 4 to 6 months after the augmenta-\ntion process to permit ideal implant placement and to ensure \ncomplete bone formation before placing the implant.\nBone resorption progression. The patient delaying treat-\nment with a Division B bone situation should be informed \nof the future bone volume resorption that presents from \ndisuse atrophy. The augmentation of bone in height is much \nless predictable and requires more advanced techniques than \naugmentation of bone width alone (Fig. 3.31). For example, \nthe patient may not be experiencing problems with a maxil-\nlary denture, but the Division B bone will resorb in height \nand decrease the stability and retention of the removable soft \ntissue–supported prosthesis. When treatment is delayed until \npatient problems begin, the overall result may be more dif-\nicult to achieve and more costly to the patient.\nincludes the need for adequate bone healing. The emer-\ngence proile angle of the inal crown, which does not \ncompromise hygiene, requires a Division A root form \nimplant (with the exception of maxillary lateral incisors \nor mandibular incisors). Stress factors may also dictate the \naugmentation approach to Division B bone in order to \nutilize larger-diameter implants. In the presence of unfa-\nvorable stress factors, the number and width of abutments \nshould be increased without increasing the CHS to provide \na greater surface area of resistance to the magniied forces, \nwhich most likely will require augmentation. To accom-\nplish this goal, augmentation is most ideal in Division \nB bone.\nModiication from Division B to Division A may lead to a \nchange in prosthesis. When a Division B ridge is changed to \na Division A by osteoplasty procedures, the inal prosthesis \ndesign has to compensate for the increased CHS. For example, \nbefore surgery, the available bone height may be compatible \nwith an FP-1 prosthetic design. If, at the time of surgery, the \nridge is found deicient in width for implant placement, it is \nnot unusual to remove crestal bone before reaching a Divi-\nsion A width. This means the inal restoration will require an \nadditional height.

The most common approach \nto modify the narrower Division B ridge into another bone \ndivision by osteoplasty is when the inal restoration is a man-\ndibular implant overdenture.

If insuficiency osteo-\nplasty is performed, lack of space will be available for the \nprosthesis, which may lead to prosthesis fracture, tooth frac-\nture, or tooth delamination.

Whereas \ngrafted ridges will more often be used when a ixed prosthesis \nis desired, ridges treated with osteoplasty before implant \nplacement are likely to be supporting removable prostheses. \nThe treatment option may be inluenced by the region to be \nrestored. For example, in a partially edentulous anterior \nmaxilla, augmentation is most often selected because of \nesthetics, and the parallel bony anatomy of the residual ridge \nis not conducive for osteoplasty to gain bone width. In the \nedentulous anterior mandible, osteoplasty is common. In the \npremolar region of the posterior mandible, Division B root \nform implants are often used because the bone density is \nadequate, available bone height is limited and may be reduced \nafter osteoplasty, and esthetics are often not a major factor.\nNot Understanding the Divisions of Bone: \nDivision C (Compromised Bone)\nThe Division C edentulous ridge exhibits moderate resorp-\ntion and presents more limiting factors for predictable end-\nosteal implant placement. The decision to restore with \nendosteal implants or to change to a more favorable bone \ndivision via augmentation before implant placement is inlu-\nenced by the prosthesis, patient force factors, and patient’s \ndesires.\nThe Division C ridge is deicient in one or more dimen-\nsions (width, length, height, or angulation) (Box 3.5) regard-\nless of the position of the implant body into the edentulous \nsite. The resorption pattern of bone occurs irst in width and \nthen in height. As a result, the Division C ridge continues to \nresorb in width, until it becomes inadequate for any design \nof endosteal implant.\nDivision C−w\nThe Division C-w is signiicantly compromised in width, and \nusually requires augmentation (facial and lingual) or osteo-\nplasty to convert the ridge to C−h (adequate height). On \noccasion, the C−w ridge may be treated by osteoplasty in the \nanterior mandible, which converts the ridge to C−h and, in \nthe anterior mandibular region, most often to a width suit-\nable for root form implants. The most common available \nbone division after osteoplasty of C−w is C−h available bone, \nnot Division A, because the CHS is greater than 15 mm. On \noccasion, the C−w osteoplasty may convert the ridge to Divi-\nsion D, especially in the posterior mandible or maxilla, which \nmost likely contraindicates implant placement. Care should \nbe exercised to prevent this from occurring because bone \nBOX 3.5 Division C Bone\nWidth (C−w bone): 0–2.5 mm\nHeight (C−h bone) <12 mm\nAngulation of occlusal load (C−a bone) >30 degrees\nCrown height space >15 mm\n(From Misch CE: Dental implant prosthetics, ed 2, St Louis, \n2015, Mosby.)\ngrafting procedures will be more challenging after the height \nhas been reduced.\nAfter the C−h ridge is augmented, it is treated with the \noptions available in the acquired bone division. A patient who \ndesires a ixed prosthesis often requires an autogenous graft \nbefore implant placement to acquire proper lip support and \nideal crown height.\nAugmentation of C−w is most often used when prosthetic \nguidelines require a ixed restoration or excess force factors \nrequire greater surface area implants and improved biome-\nchanics for the prosthesis (Fig. 3.32).\nComplications of C−w\nMore dificult surgery. The C−w augmentation is more \ndificult than for Division B bone because the need for bone \nvolume is greater, yet the recipient bed is more deicient. \nBecause less host bone is present, more dificulty in using \nixation screws results. Additionally, there exists a decreased \nblood supply, which may compromise healing. Usually, block \nbone grafts are indicated with the use of bone graft factors. \nSoft tissue complications, such as incision line opening, are \nalso more common in C−w augmentations than Division B \nbecause of compromised attached tissue (Fig. 3.33).\nFast resorption. The clinician must be aware that the C−w \nbone will resorb to a C−h ridge as fast as A resorbs to B and \nfaster than B resorbs to C−w. In addition, without implant or \nbone graft intervention, the C−h available bone will eventu-\nally evolve into Division D (severe atrophy). Care should be \nnoted to prevent excessive force or pressure on the ridge via \na removable prosthesis.\nDivision C-h\nThe Division C-h bone exhibits moderate to advanced \natrophy vertical height of bone of 7 to 9 mm, or the crown \nFIG 3.32 (A) and (B) Division C−w. \nA\nB"

Moderate to advanced \natrophy may be used to describe the clinical conditions of \nDivision C. The posterior maxilla and mandible are common \nareas for Division C−h bone. This is due to vital structures \nsuch as the maxillary sinus or mandibular canal, which limits \nvertical height sooner than the opposing cortical plates in the \nanterior regions.\nThe Division C edentulous ridge does not offer as many \nelements for predictable endosteal implant or prosthesis \nsuccess as in Divisions A or B. Anatomic landmarks to deter-\nmine implant angulations or positions in relation to the \nincisal edge are usually not present, and greater surgical skill \nis required. The clinician must realize that Division C ridge \nimplant–supported prostheses are more complex and have \nslightly more complications in healing, prosthetic design, or \nlong-term maintenance. On the other hand, the patients will \nusually have greater need for increased prosthodontic support. \nDespite the reduced bone volume, modiications of the treat-\nment plan and prosthesis that decrease stress can provide \npredictable, long-term treatment (Fig. 3.34).\nComplications C−h\nMandible-loor of mouth. When the anterior mandible is \nC−h, the loor of the mouth is often level with the residual \nmandibular crest of the ridge, which present many potential \ncomplications. Additionally, less attached tissue is present, \nwhich may cause chronic tissue-related issues. During swallow-\ning, it may prolapse over the residual crest and implant sites, \ncausing constant irritation of the permucosal implant posts and \nimpairing proper design of the prosthetic superstructures.\nShort implants. In C−h ridges, a common treatment \noption is the use of short implants. A C−h root form implant \nis usually 4 mm or greater in width at the crest module and \n10 mm or less in height. Several studies indicate that implant \nsurvival is decreased when an implant is less than 10 mm in \nheight. For example, a large multi-center study of 31 different \nsites and six different implant designs observed 13% failure \nwith 10-mm implants, 18% failure with 8-mm implants, and \n25% failure with 7-mm implants.15 The implant failure did \nnot occur after surgery but rather after prosthetic delivery. \nThe loading failure is most likely due to an inadequate \nimplant support combined with a magniication of force \nresulting from excessive CHS.\nWhen endosteal root form implants are used in Division \nC−h bone with greater crown heights, additional implants \nshould be placed to increase the overall implant-bone surface \narea, and the prosthesis should load the implants in an \naxial direction. Additionally, a narrow occlusal table is indi-\ncated to decrease force-related complications. Because the CHS \nis most likely greater than 15 mm, the design of a removable \nprosthesis should often reduce or eliminate cantilever length \nand incorporate a stress relief mechanism.

The patient often requires \naugmentation with autogenous bone before implant and \nprosthodontic reconstruction. Severe atrophy describes the \nclinical condition of the Division D ridge.\nDivision D Maxilla. The Division D maxilla occurs when \n6 mm or less of bone exists in the anterior maxilla below the \nloor of the nose, or less than 6 mm of posterior bone is \npresent below the maxillary sinus. In the maxilla, basal bone \nloss eventually results in a completely lat maxilla. The par-\ntially or completely edentulous patient with a posterior Divi-\nsion D maxilla and healthy anterior teeth or implants may \nundergo sinus augmentation procedures to increase bone \nvolume for implant placement. The CHS may be insuficient \nfor onlay grafts in the posterior maxilla despite a lack of avail-\nable bone height because the sinus expands faster than the \ncrest of the ridge resorbs. Endosteal implants of adequate \nheight can rarely be positioned in the posterior maxilla with \nDivision D bone without a sinus graft. After 6 months post–\nsinus graft, the Division D posterior maxilla is restored to \nDivision A or C−h, and root form implants may be inserted \nfor posterior prosthodontic support (Box 3.6 and Fig. 3.37).\nComplications – maxilla.

Another complication related to \nthe Division C–a is placement of implants that perforate the \nbony plates. The Division C−a anterior mandible is angled \nmore than 30 degrees. If the clinician is unaware of this angu-\nlation, the implants may perforate the lingual plate and irri-\ntate the tissues of the loor of the mouth or cause signiicant \nbleeding episodes.

Clini-\ncians treating anterior Division D mandibles should be able to \nmanage future complications, which may be extensive.\nImplants without bone grafting. Endosteal root form \nimplants without autogenous grafts may be used on rare occa-\nsions in the anterior Division D mandible when the remaining \nbone is dense and the opposing arch is edentulous. Care must \nbe taken during placement because mandibular fracture at \ninsertion or during postoperative healing is a possible compli-\ncation. Under these conditions the CHS is very great, and the \nnumber of implants is often four or fewer. Implant failure \nafter loading is a greater risk. Implant failure results with cir-\ncumferential bone loss, which may be associated with man-\ndibular fracture through the implant site. An RP-5 removable \nrestoration is usually indicated for Division D with only ante-\nrior implants. However, the RP-5 restoration allows continued \nbone resorption and atrophy to continue in the posterior \nregions. The prudent therapy is to educate the patient as to the \nrisks of the situation and offer an autologous bone graft and \nimplants to support a RP-4 restoration (Fig. 3.38).\nLack of early treatment. The Division D arch requires \ngreater clinician training and results in more frequent com-\nplications related to grafting, early implant failure, and soft \ntissue management, and treatment options include a more \nguarded prognosis. It should be the goal of every clinician \nto educate and treat the patient before a Division D bone \nof any design. Autogenous iliac crest bone grafts to improve \nthe anterior Division D are strongly recommended before any \nimplant treatment is attempted.73 After autogenous bone \ngrafts are completed and allowed to heal for 5 or more \nmonths, the bone division is usually Division C−h (or pos-\nsible Division A), and endosteal implants may be inserted.\nThe autogenous bone grafts are not intended for improved \ndenture support (without future implant placement). If soft \ntissue–borne prostheses are fabricated on autogenous grafts, \nthe bone will resorb at an accelerated rate. Additional augmen-\ntation to compensate for this resorption is not indicated. \nRepeated relines, highly mobile tissue, sore spots, and patient \nfrustration are all consequences. However, autogenous bone \ngrafts are maintained long term in conjunction with implant \nplacement. Because of the stimulation of the augmented bone, \nbone supporting the implants will be maintained. The com-\npletely lat anterior Division D maxilla should not be aug-\nmented with only hydroxyapatite (nonresorbable) to improve \ndenture support. Inadequate ridge form usually exists to guide \nthe placement of the material. As a result, migration of the graft \nat the time of surgery or in the future after soft tissue loading \nis a frequent sequela leading to signiicant complications.\nDivision D Mandible\nComplications – mandible. In the Division D mandible, \nthe superior genial tubercles become the most superior aspect \nof the ridge. The mentalis muscle loses much of its attach-\nment, even though the superior portion of the muscle attaches \nnear the crest of the resorbed ridge. In the posterior mandible, \nthe buccinator muscle may approach the mylohyoid muscle \nand form an aponeurosis above the body of the mandible. \nThe mandibular arch also presents with mental foraminae \nand portions of the mandibular canal dehiscent. It is not \ninfrequent that these patients develop neurosensory impair-\nment of the lower lip, especially during mastication. The CHS \nis usually greater than 20 mm, which results in a signiicant \nforce multiplier and can rarely be reduced enough to render \nlong-term success of the prosthesis.\nProsthesis type. The prosthetic result for anterior ridges \nwith Division D without augmentation is the poorest treat-\nment outcome of all the divisions of bone. Fixed restorations \nare nearly always contraindicated because the CHS is so sig-\nniicant resulting in a biomechanical disadvantage. When \ntreated without augmentation, completely implant-supported \noverdentures are indicated whenever possible to decrease the \nsoft tissue and nerve complications. An RP-5 restoration is \nnot suggested because bone loss will continue in the soft \ntissue–supported region of the overdenture; usually there is \nlack of a buccal shelf (primary stress bearing area).\nPathologic fracture. The mandibular completely edentu-\nlous Division D patient is the most dificult to treat in implant \ndentistry. Beneits must be carefully weighed against the risks \nassociated with augmentation procedures. Although the clini-\ncian and patient often regard this condition as the most desper-\nate, these patients may easily end up with pathologic fracture \ncomplications. If implant failure occurs, the patient may become \na dental cripple—unable to wear any prosthesis. Idiopathic \nFIG 3.38 Division D Mandible: (A) Panoramic image.

    "content": "78\nCHAPTER 3 Treatment Planning Complications\nMisch has postulated four general guidelines to determine \nkey implant positions for a ixed prosthesis in the edentulous \nsite with multiple adjacent teeth missing:17\n1. Cantilevers on prostheses designed for partially edentu-\nlous patients or completely edentulous maxillae should \npreferably be eliminated; the terminal abutments in the \nrestoration are key positions.\n2. Three adjacent pontics should not be designed in the pros-\nthesis, especially in the posterior regions of the mouth.\n3. When the canine is missing, the canine site is a key posi-\ntion, especially when other adjacent teeth are missing.\n4. When the irst molar is missing, the irst molar site is a key \nimplant position for all partially edentulous patients and \ncompletely edentulous maxillae.\nNo Cantilevers\nThe irst rule for ideal key implant positions is that no can-\ntilever should be designed in the ixed prosthesis for partially \nedentulous patients or full-arch maxillary ixed restorations \n(unless favorable force factors). Cantilevers are signiicant \nforce magniiers, which result in excessive force to the cement \nor prosthesis screws, prosthesis superstructure, abutment \nscrews, implant-bone interface, and the implants.18\nCantilevers on ixed partial dentures (FPDs) supported by \nteeth have a higher complication rate than prostheses with \nterminal abutments.19 The primary causes of traditional \nthree-unit FPD failure with natural tooth abutments are \ncaries and endodontic complications (often related to the \ntooth preparation or decay). The 5-year survival rate of the \ntraditional FPD is often above 95%.20 However, when a can-\ntilevered three-unit FPD supported by two teeth is used to \nreplace a missing tooth, the failure rate is over 25% within \nthe irst 5 years, and the complication rate increases to 40% \nby 10 years; the primary cause of failure is biomechanics.21\nWhen a load is placed on the cantilever portion of a prosthe-\nsis, the abutment farthest from the cantilevered pontic has a \ntensile and shear force applied to the cement seal because the \ntooth adjacent to the pontic acts as a fulcrum (Fig. 3.40). Cements \nare 20 times weaker to tension and shear compared with forces \nin compression.22 Therefore, with a cantilevered prosthesis, the \ncement seal breaks on the most distal abutment, and then the \nabutment often decays. The abutment closest to the cantilever \nbecomes mobile or fractures (especially when endodontics was \nperformed) because it is the only retained abutment for the \nprosthesis. These biomechanical-related complications usually \noccur in a relatively shorter period of time compared with bio-\nlogic complications (e.g., decay or periodontal disease).\nOne Missing Tooth\nIdeal placement. When one tooth is replaced with an \nimplant, the implant should be inserted into the mesiodistal \ncenter of the site. If the implant is positioned in the mesial-\ndistal center, a cantliever will result. As a general rule, the \nimplant should be 1.5 to 2 mm from an adjacent tooth. Care \nshould be exercised to decrease the possibility of placing the \nimplant too far from the natural teeth. This will also result in \na cantilevered prosthesis.\ncondition develops. For example, the profession treats peri-\nodontal diseases before pain in the region occurs, and carious \nlesions are removed from teeth before abscess formation. \nBone loss is monitored around teeth in millimeters and \nrequires continued care to reduce the risks of future tooth \nand bone loss. Likewise, prudent practitioners monitor bone \nloss in edentulous sites and offer education and treatment \nbefore deleterious effects occur.\nKEY IMPLANT POSITION\nTREATMENT PLANNING\nImplant positions are an important component of the dental \nimplant treatment planning process, which is crucial to \nreduce force reduction to the implant system. The maximum \nnumber of potential implants that may be used in a ixed \nprosthesis is usually determined by allowing 1.5 to 2.0 mm \nor more from each natural tooth and a 3-mm space between \neach implant and adding the diameter of the implant (Fig. \n3.39). This results in dividing the length of the span by 7 mm \nfor the maximum number of implants (when the implants \nare 4 mm in diameter − 14 mm space divided by 7 = 2 × \n4.0 mm implants). Hence, a 21- to 27-mm span may have \nthree implants, and a 28- to 34-mm span may have four \nimplants. The key implant positions are more important sites \nthan the others to reduce biomechanical forces. When uti-\nlized, the key implant abutment locations will decrease bio-\nmechanical complications.\nFIG 3.39 The maximum number of implants in an edentulous \nspan may be determined by allowing 1.5 mm or more from \nan adjacent tooth and 3 mm between each implant and \nadding the diameter of the implants.

    "content": "79\nCHAPTER 3 Treatment Planning Complications\nTwo Missing Teeth. When two adjacent teeth are missing, \ntwo implants should ideally support the implant restoration. \nAs a result, whenever two adjacent teeth are missing and the \nspace is 12 mm or more, two adjacent implants should be \ninserted, even in the esthetic zone.\nTo enforce the rule of no cantilever, the key implant posi-\ntions indicate one implant per tooth when one or two adja-\ncent teeth are missing with a span of more than 12 mm (when \nthe implant diameter is 3 mm), 13 mm (when one implant \nis 3 mm and the other 4 mm), and so on (Fig. 3.43).\nWhen one of the two (or more) missing teeth include a \nmolar, one of the terminal implants should be positioned \n1.5 mm from the anterior adjacent tooth and the other ter-\nminal implant at the distal of the last molar, not in the middle \nof the molar. In this fashion, the 3-mm cantilever from the \nmidmolar to the marginal ridge is eliminated when the \nimplants are splinted together. When the implant is not posi-\ntioned in the distal molar position, the size of the last molar \nshould be reduced to eliminate the cantilever. The clinician \nshould be aware that the last molar should ideally be a \npremolar-size crown when the distal implant is positioned in \nthe mesial to midmolar position.\nLower incisor option. When missing two mandibular inci-\nsors, usually one implant may be placed interproximally, \nslightly lingual with a screw-retained prosthesis. If all four \nlower incisors are missing, two implants may be placed inter-\nproximally, distributing the cantilever amount equally (Fig. \n3.44). This area involves lower force factors.\nThree Missing Teeth. When three adjacent teeth are \nmissing, the key implant positions include the two terminal \nabutments, one on each end of the prosthesis (Fig. 3.45). \nA three-unit prosthesis may be fabricated with only these \nabutments when most of the force factors are low to moder-\nate and the bone density is favorable. A cantilevered restora-\ntion on multiple splinted implants may be compared to a \nImplant size. A 4-mm implant requires 7 mm of space \n(4 mm + 1.5 mm + 1.5 mm). When a molar (∼10–12 mm) is \nreplaced, the implant should be larger in diameter to decrease \nthe mesial and distal cantilever and placed in the mesiodistal \ncenter of the edentulous site. This decreases the biomechanical-\nrelated risks to the implant system. A common treatment \nplanning problem is when the implant size is selected on the \navailable bone with no emphasis on the space being replaced \n(Figs. 3.41 and 3.42).\nFIG 3.40 When a compressive force is placed on a cantilever \nfrom two (or more) natural teeth, the closest tooth acts as a \nfulcrum, and the distal tooth from the cantilever has a shear \nand tensile load applied to the cement seal. In this example, \nthe compressive load is applied to a irst premolar, the second \npremolar acts as a fulcrum, and the shear and tensile load is \napplied to the irst molar.

Therefore when two implants are 10 mm apart \nwith a cantilever or extension of 20 mm, the mechanical \nadvantage is 2 (20 mm/10 mm). In this example, a 25-lb force \non the cantilever results in a 50-lb tensile force on the farthest \nabutment from the cantilever (25 lb × 2 = 50 lb). The abut-\nment closest to the cantilever (fulcrum) receives a compres-\nsive force equal to the sum of the other two forces, or, in this \nexample, 75 lb (25 lb + 50 lb). In other words, the force on \nthe cantilever increases the force on the implants by two to \nthree times (Fig. 3.46). Cantilevers magnify forces to all the \nabutments supporting the prosthesis.\nWhen a cantilevered force exists, a greater load to the \nimplant farthest from the cantilever results in a tensile or \nshear type of force, and any part of the implant system is at \nan increased risk of biomechanical failure (e.g., porcelain \nfracture, uncemented prosthesis, abutment screw loosening, \ncrestal bone loss, implant failure, implant component or body \nfracture). This is especially observed when parafunction or \nincreased CHS exists.\nTo eliminate posterior cantilevers, bone augmentation is \noften indicated to increase bone volume for implant place-\nment. However, there does exist disadvantages of bone aug-\nmentation procedures. Bone augmentation often requires an \nadditional surgery before implant placement. Additional \ntraining is required to learn bone augmentation procedures, \nthe learning curve is longer, and it is more dificult to become \naccomplished in these techniques. Complications related to \nbone augmentation are more common than implant surgery \nin existing bone volumes and may be more extensive and even \ndebilitating to the patient. However, cantilevered implant \nprostheses have a more frequently observed biomechanical \nrisk than the surgical risks of augmentation, and these risks \ncan cause the loss of the entire implant support and prosthe-\nsis. Additionally, bone loss and resultant defects from implant \nfailure may make the following bone augmentation proce-\ndures even more dificult to perform than when treatment \nwas rendered in the original condition."

During \nheavy biting on the side of the jaw, the bottom of the man-\ndible rotates to the buccal, and the crest slightly rolls toward \nthe lingual, again, distal to the mental foramen (Fig. 3.48).23 \nAs a consequence of this lexure, splinting a molar implant \nacross the arch to the contralateral molar may cause discom-\nfort and lateral forces on the implant sites. With implant \nprostheses, uncemented restorations, bone loss, and even \nimplant failure have been observed when there was cross-arch \nsplinting of molars.\nNo Three Adjacent Pontics\nIn most prostheses designs, three adjacent pontics are contra-\nindicated on natural tooth abutments in the posterior regions \nof the mouth (Fig. 3.49). The adjacent abutments are sub-\njected to considerable additional force when they must \nsupport three missing teeth, especially in the posterior regions \nof the mouth. When three adjacent posterior teeth are missing \nbetween remaining teeth (and the third molar is absent), the \nterminal abutments are the second molar and the canine. The \nforces in the posterior regions are three to four times greater \nthan the anterior region, and the force on the canine is \ntwo times greater than on the anterior region. In addition, \nthe canine receives a lateral load in most excursions. The \nlateral load increases the intensity of the force and places the \ncement seal and porcelain/zirconia under more tensile and \nshear loads.\nIn addition to the greater loads applied to the abutment \nteeth, all pontic spans between abutments lex under load. \nThe greater the span between abutments, the greater the lex-\nibility of the metal in the prosthesis. In a one-pontic prosthe-\nsis, minimal lexure results (8 µm or less with precious metal \nunder a 25-lb load). In comparison, a two-pontic span lexes \neight times more than a one-pontic span, all other variables \nbeing equal. Although the metal lexure is more for the two-\npontic prosthesis, the failure rate of three- or four-unit pros-\nthesis supported by natural teeth is similar for the irst 5 years \nbecause the cause of failure is mostly biologic (e.g., caries).\nThe metal between abutments for a three-pontic span \nlexes 27 times more than that of a one-pontic span if all other \nfactors are equal (Fig. 3.50).24 In addition, the greater the \nload, the greater the lexure.

An 11- to \n13-unit prosthesis has ive key abutments (two terminal and \nthree pier), and a 14-unit prosthesis has six key abutment \npositions. In addition to these key abutments, additional \nabutments may be required to address patient force factors \nand bone density. Rarely is the force factor situation favorable \nand bone density ideal enough in a maxilla to be fulilled with \nsolely key abutments for a ixed prosthesis replacing more \nthan ive teeth.\nThree-Pontic Options. Angled forces to the premaxilla \nmagnify the amount of the force to the implant system in \nboth centric and excursive occlusal forces. Therefore, most \nmaxillary anterior prostheses should also limit the number \nof pontics in the restoration. The exception to the no three-\npontic rule is most often the anterior mandible, when the \nthree adjacent missing teeth are mandibular incisors. As long \nas implants are placed in the canine position, the number of \npontics may be increased because of the long axis angle of \nforce, the reduced bite force, and the good bone quality. \nHowever, when the dentate arch position is tapered and the \nthe prosthesis has three pontics (because they are supporting \ntwo abutments and three pontics) but the lexure of the metal \nalso increases to a point that the incidence of complications \nmakes the treatment plan contraindicated, especially when \nforces are greater (as in the posterior region). As a result, a \nthree–adjacent-pontic prosthesis has an increased failure rate \ncompared with a one- or two-pontic ixed prosthesis. The \nincreased failure rate of long-span ixed prostheses is due \nlargely to the increase in biomechanical complications (e.g., \nunretained restorations and fracture). As a consequence, it is \nwell accepted in the literature that three pontics in the pos-\nterior regions are contraindicated for natural teeth.\nThe lexure of materials in a long span is more of a problem \nfor implants than natural teeth. Because natural roots have \nsome mobility both apically and laterally, the tooth acts as a \nstress absorber, and the amount of material lexure may be \nreduced. Because an implant is more rigid than a tooth (and \nhas a greater modulus of elasticity than a natural tooth), the \nrisk for complications of increased load and material lexure \nare greater for an implant prosthesis. Because three posterior \npontics are contraindicated in a natural tooth–ixed prosthe-\nsis, it is even more important not to have three pontics in an \nimplant restoration.\nThe span of the pontics in the ideal treatment plan should \nbe limited to the size of two premolars, which is 13 to 16 mm. \nWhen a molar is one of the teeth missing between existing \nteeth, the missing molar space alone may be 10 to 13 mm \nlong. As a result, when a large second premolar and irst \nmolar are missing, this edentulous span is often treatment \nplanned to replace three teeth, rather than two, and an addi-\ntional implant is warranted in this span. This is especially \nappropriate for greater patient forces (i.e., moderate to severe \nparafunction) or softer bone types (i.e., D3 and D4).\nTo limit the effect of the complications of three adjacent \npremolar-size pontics, additional intraimplant key positions \nare indicated in prostheses missing ive or more adjacent \nteeth.

As a consequence, when a canine is missing, \na single tooth implant replacing the canine is the ideal treat-\nment of choice (Box 3.7).\nWhen two adjacent teeth are missing and include a canine, \ntwo implants are required. Even when a canine and lateral \nincisor are in the esthetic zone, it is better to reduce the size \nof the implants and place two implants with no cantilever \nrather than place a larger implant with a cantilever. The \nimplants should be at least 3 mm apart so the base of the \ninterimplant papilla can support the soft tissue drape.\nA traditional ixed prosthetic axiom on natural teeth indi-\ncates it is contraindicated to replace a canine and two or \nmore adjacent teeth.24 If a patient desires a ixed prosthesis, \nimplants are required whenever the following adjacent teeth \nare missing in either arch: (1) the irst premolar, canine, and \nlateral incisor; (2) the second premolar, irst premolar, and \ncanine; and (3) the canine, lateral, and central incisors. \nWhenever these combinations of teeth are missing, implants \nare required to restore the patient because (1) the length of \nthe span is three adjacent teeth, (2) the lateral direction of \nforce during mandibular excursions increases the stress to the \nprosthesis, (3) the magnitude of the bite force is increased in \nthe canine region compared with the anterior region, and (4) \nan implant in the canine region with implant-protected \nocclusion (mutually protected occlusion) distributes reduced \nlateral loads during mandibular excursions.\nThe canine is the most important position for the occlusal \nscheme of the patient. Canine guidance or mutually protected \nocclusion is the primary occlusal format in most ixed \nimplant reconstructions or completely implant-supported \nremovable restorations. The angled force of approximately 22 \nto 25 degrees in excursions should not be magniied on a \ncanine pontic with an implant prosthesis supported by fewer \nimplants.27 Although the force reduction in excursions is not \nas great with an implant as with a natural canine tooth, there \nstill is some force reduction as a consequence of the class III \nlever effect.28 Whenever the canine and two or more adjacent \nteeth are missing, the canine is a critical site along with the \nterminal positions of the span (Fig. 3.54).\nWhen the three adjacent teeth are the irst premolar, \ncanine, and lateral incisors, the key implant positions are the \nirst premolar, the canine, and the lateral incisor when the \noverall intratooth space is greater than 19 mm because three \nthree anterior pontics are cantilevered to the facial, an addi-\ntional implant is indicated even in the anterior mandible.\nCanine Rule\nIn any arch, certain positions are more important sites than \nothers. In the dental arch, these more important positions are \nrepresented by the canine and the irst molar (Fig. 3.52).25 \nThe canine root has more surface area in either arch com-\npared with any other anterior tooth, and the molar has more \nroot surface area than any posterior teeth (Fig. 3.53).26 The \ncanine is a particularly interesting tooth. When a lateral force \nis placed on the natural canine and no posterior teeth are in \ncontact, two thirds of the masseter and temporalis muscles \ndo not contract, and the resultant force on the anterior teeth \nis less. In addition, because the mandible acts as a class III \nlever, with the temporomandibular joint behind the muscles \nof mastication, the force applied to the anterior teeth is less \nwhen the posterior teeth do not occlude. Therefore, both \nbiologic and biomechanical factors make the canine position \nan important site in the dental arch.\nA ixed restoration replacing a canine is at greater risk than \nnearly any other restoration in the mouth. The maxillary or \nFIG 3.52 In a dental arch, the two most important biome-\nchanical positions are represented by the canine and the irst \nmolars.

    "content": "85\nCHAPTER 3 Treatment Planning Complications\nFirst Molar Rule\nThe molars have the most root surface area of any natural \ntooth in the mouth and have two or three roots. The biome-\nchanical rationale for this condition is that the bite force \ndoubles in the molar position compared with that of the \npremolar position in both the maxilla and mandible. In addi-\ntion, the edentulous span of a missing irst molar is usually \n10 to 12 mm compared with a 7-mm span for a premolar. As \na result, the irst molar is also a key implant position.17\nAs previously presented, cantilevers should not be used in \npartially edentulous patients to replace a irst molar, espe-\ncially when patient force factors are moderate to great (e.g., \nparafunction, opposing arch). The cantilever further increases \nthe force of the molar region to the splinted abutments. As a \nresult, uncemented restorations, bone loss, and failure are at \ngreater risk.\nWhen a irst molar is missing, a 5- to 6-mm-diameter \nimplant is indicated in the mid mesiodistal position of the \nedentulous site when the molar is less than 12 mm wide. \nWhen a irst molar implant is indicated in the maxilla, a sinus \nbone graft is most always required. The maxillary sinus \nexpands rapidly after tooth loss. More often than not, the \nsinus loor should be altered and grafted in conjunction with \na irst molar implant insertion.\nWhen two adjacent teeth are missing, including a irst \nmolar, the key implant positions include the terminal abut-\nments, including the distal molar position. When three pos-\nterior teeth are missing and include a irst molar, a irst molar \nimplant is included. For example, in a patient missing the \nsecond premolar, irst molar, and second molar, three key \nimplant positions are required to restore the full contour of \nthe missing molars teeth: the second premolar and second \nmolar terminal abutments and the irst molar pier abutment \n(Fig. 3.57). A similar scenario is present when all four poste-\nrior teeth are missing—irst premolar, second premolar, irst \nmolar, and second molar. The key implant positions are the \nterminal abutments (irst premolar and second molar) and \nimplants with no cantilever reduce any increased force factor \nrisks. The minimum implant sizes are usually 3.5 mm for the \npremolar and canine and 3 mm for the lateral incisor.\nWhen the irst premolar, canine, and lateral incisor are \nmissing and the intratooth span is less than 19 mm, only two \nimplants are used to support the prosthesis. In this scenario, \nit is better to place terminal abutments and have a canine \npontic, especially when the prosthesis is within the esthetic \nzone. The size of the implants is slightly increased to com-\npensate for the angled forces during a lateral excursion. In \naddition, the amount of the incisal vertical overbite is \nreduced to decrease the leverage effect on the canine. The \nincisal guidance should be as shallow as possible to decrease \nthe force during excursions. However, it must be steep \nenough to separate the posterior teeth in the mandibular \nexcursions.\nWhen there are multiple missing teeth on each side of the \ncanine site, the canine edentulous site is a key pier abutment \nposition. The canine position is a key implant position to help \ndisocclude the posterior teeth in mandibular excursions. \nAs a result, when four or ive adjacent teeth are missing, \nincluding a canine and at least one adjacent posterior premo-\nlar tooth, the key implant positions are the terminal abut-\nments and the canine position. For example, when the irst \npremolar, canine, lateral, and central incisor are missing, the \nkey implant positions are the irst premolar and central \nincisor (terminal abutments) and the canine (canine rule) \n(Fig. 3.55).\nWhen six or more adjacent teeth are missing, which \ninclude both canines, additional pier abutments (which limit \nthe pontics’ spans to no more than two teeth) are also indi-\ncated. For example, when the irst premolar to irst premolar \nare missing, ive key implants are indicated, especially in the \nmaxillary arch—the terminal abutments, the canines, and an \nadditional implant in one of the central incisor positions. The \nsame ive key implant positions exist for the one-tooth span \nof second premolar to second premolar (Fig. 3.56).\nFIG 3.54 A panoramic radiograph of a patient missing a maxillary right canine, lateral incisor, and \ncentral incisor.

This treatment \noption does not consider the force magniiers of CHS or the \nA-P spread of the implants in relationship to the anterior \ncantilever replacing the anterior teeth. In addition, when four \nimplants support a 12-unit ixed prosthesis, the position of \nthe implants cannot follow the four key implant position \nrules, and there are often no implants in the canine positions \nand more than three pontics between the anterior implants \nor three pontics cantilevered from the most distal implants.\nIn full-arch prostheses, studies comparing six implants \nto four- and three-implant abutments show better distribu-\ntion and reduced stress on the six-implant system compo-\nnents (crown, cement, abutment, abutment screw, marginal \nbone, implant-bone interface, and implant components) \n(Fig. 3.63).32 Silva et al evaluated, with three-dimensional \ninite element analyses, the difference in four vs. six implants \nto support a full-arch cantilevered prosthesis.29 The cantilever \nlength and crown height were similar in both models. The \nsix-implant support model reduced the stress to the implant-\nbone regions between 7% to 29%, depending on the direction \nand position of the applied load.\nIn rare cases, four implants in the mandible between the \nforamen may be used to support a full-arch implant-supported \nprosthesis—ixed or RP-4. The implants are typically positioned \nin the irst to second premolar positions, and the canines. \nHowever, the other patient force factors should be low (e.g., no \nmoderate to severe parafunction, crown height space less than \n15 mm, older woman, and opposing a maxillary complete \ndenture). In addition, the bone density should be favorable (D2). \nWhen all of these conditions are not present, consideration is \ngiven to the ive key implant positions, and more implants are \nindicated when stress factors are moderate to severe.\nWhen a full-arch ixed implant restoration is the treatment \nfor a maxillary arch, the suggested number of implants by \nsome authors is often the same as the mandible. For example, \n“all on four” is a common treatment option presented to the \nprofession in either arch along with similar fees for either \narch to the patient (Fig. 3.64).33 Yet a literature review reveals \nthe anterior mandible) in both centric and mandibular excur-\nsions. The anterior maxillary arch usually has shorter implants \nthan the anterior mandible because the vertical height of \nbone is less compared with the anterior mandible. The shorter \nimplants have less surface area and higher stresses, especially \nin soft bone. Maxillary ixed restorations most often oppose \nan implant prosthesis (usually ixed) or natural teeth. This \nincreases the force to the maxillary prosthesis. Therefore, the \nbiomechanical risks associated with full-arch maxillary pros-\ntheses with a molar cantilever are greater than for mandibular \nrestorations. A literature review of full-arch prostheses reports \nan implant failure rate three times higher in full-arch maxil-\nlary implant ixed restorations than with mandibular full-\narch implant restorations.30 The treatment plan should be \ndifferent for the two arches.\nThe key implant positions for an edentulous maxilla are \nthe distal of the irst molars bilaterally, the bilateral canines, \nand an implant in one of the central incisor positions between \nthe canines. This permits the ive sections of an arch to be \nsplinted together and take advantage of the biomechanics of \nan arch (Fig. 3.61).\nIMPLANT NUMBER\nTREATMENT PLANNING\nIn the past, the number of implants most often was deter-\nmined in relation to the amount of available bone. This \nconcept became popular in the mid 1980s, when the Bråne-\nmark philosophy of osseointegrations was introduced for \ncompletely edentulous arches. In an edentulous arch, four to \nsix anterior implants were used in available bone situations \nbetween the mental foramina in the mandible and anterior \nto the maxillary sinuses in the maxilla for a full-arch ixed \nprosthesis. The prosthesis cantilevered the molars from the \nanterior implant positions. Four implants were used in mod-\nerate to severe atrophic ridges for a ixed full-arch prosthe-\nsis.31 This concept has been expanded to include zygomatic \nimplants in the posterior regions, which engage the palate \nFIG 3.61 The key implant positions for an edentulous maxilla to support a ixed prosthesis (or \nRP-4 prosthesis) are the bilateral molars, the bilateral canines, and an implant in one of the central \nincisor positions.

The mandible more often has hard \n(strong) bone, and the maxilla more often has softer bone. In \nfact, the posterior maxillary bone may be 5 to 10 times weaker \nthan the hard bone of the anterior mandible.34 As a result, \nmore implants should be used in the poorer-quality bone \nfound in the maxilla. Increasing the implant number decreases \nthe periimplant bone stress.\nThe maxillary anterior arch receives a force at a 12- to \n15-degree angle during occlusion and up to a 30-degree angle \nin excursions. A 15-degree angled force increases the force \ncomponent on the implant by 25.9%, and a 30-degree \nforce increases the force by 50%.35 This is a biomechanical \nrationale for why maxillary anterior teeth are larger than the \nmandibular anterior teeth. Hence, the size or number of \nimplants in the anterior maxilla should be greater than an \nanterior mandible.\nThe excursive forces in a maxillary restoration come from \nwithin the arch to push outside the arch. This force direction \non the maxillary arch is more detrimental than in the man-\ndible. The mandible receives a force from outside of the arch \ntoward the inside of the arch, which is the mechanism of force \nthe Roman or gothic arch was designed to resist. As a result \nof these biomechanical issues, more implants should be used \nin maxillary compared with mandibular restorations. It is \nprobably not a coincidence that there are more roots for the \nteeth in the maxillary arch compared with those in the man-\ndibular arch.\nThe minimum number of implants used to support a \nrestoration should include all of the key implant positions. \nYet the number of implants in a treatment plan should rarely \nbe the minimum. There is no safety factor if an implant fails: \nthe prosthesis becomes partially unretained, or the patient \nhas a parafunctional episode. For example, if 25 patients \nreceive four implants to support a ixed prosthesis, there \nwould be 25 ixed prostheses and 100 implants in the report. \nThis type of treatment planning may initially be less expen-\nsive for the patient, but an implant failure any time after \nimplant surgery places the patient’s restoration at consider-\nable risk. If each patient lost one implant with this implant \nnumber per prosthesis, the overall implant success would be \n75%, but there would only remain three implants in each \npatient. As a result, all 25 ixed prostheses would be at risk of \noverload failure. If 20% of the implants fail (with one failure \nper patient), only 5 of the 25 patients would have four \nimplants to support the restoration (only 20% of the patients \nwould be restored with a ixed prosthesis) (Table 3.2).17\nIf the 25 edentulous patients in this example have eight \nimplants to support a full-arch, 12-unit ixed prosthesis, the \nrisk of prosthesis failure is signiicantly reduced (Table 3.3). \nIf each patient loses one implant, most likely all patients \nwould still be able to function with their original prosthesis. \nEven if all 25 patients lost two implants, the 25 restorations \nmay still function without risk (depending on the implant \nfailure location). The additional implants also reduce the can-\ntilever length and reduce the number of pontics in the \nTABLE 3.2 Implants vs. Prosthesis \nSuccess: Four Implants per Prosthesis  \nfor 25 Patients (100 Implants for  \n25 Prostheses)\nImplant Number \nSuccess Rate\nProsthesis \nNumber\nProsthesis \nSuccess Rate\n100%\n25\n100%\n90%\n15\n60%\n80%\n5\n20%\n75%\n0\n0%\n(From Misch CE: Dental implant prosthetics, ed 2, St Louis, \n2015, Mosby.)\nTABLE 3.3 Implants vs. Prosthesis \nSuccess: Eight Implants per Prosthesis  \nfor 25 Patients (200 Implants for  \n25 Prostheses)\nImplant Number \nSuccess Rate\nProsthesis \nNumber\nSuccess Rate\n100%\n25\n100%\n87.5%\n25\n100%\n75%\n25\n100%\n(From Misch CE: Dental implant prosthetics, ed 2, St Louis, \n2015, Mosby.)\nprosthesis, providing more abutments for greater retention \nof the restoration, with reduced risk of screw loosening or \nuncemented prosthesis.

When the implants \nare limited to sites anterior to the mental foraminae to \nsupport a ixed prosthesis, a cantilever must be designed. \nCantilevers in the mandible should ideally be projected in \nonly one posterior quadrant to increase the A-P distance and \nreduce the force to the implants (Fig. 3.65). Whenever pos-\nsible, at least one implant should be positioned in a irst \nmolar site. When implants are positioned in four of the ive \nopen pentagon positions in the mandible, a cantilever is at a \nreduced risk of overload because of favorable dynamics of an \narch, increased A-P distance, and usually a more favorable \nbone density. When seven or more implants are used in the \nedentulous mandible with bilateral molar implants, two sepa-\nrate restorations may be fabricated with no posterior cantile-\nver to permit mandibular lexure and torsion. Usually, the \nsecond molar is not replaced in the edentulous mandible.\nImplant Number: Full-Arch Maxillary  \nFixed Prostheses\nThe edentulous maxillary ixed prosthesis should usually \nnot have a cantilever. The irst seven ideal sites are often the \nbilateral irst molars, bilateral second premolars, bilateral \ncanines, and one implant between the canine positions \n(Fig. 3.66). These positions satisfy the key implant positions \nand add an implant in the posterior region because the bone \ndensity is often poor. Additional implants in the bilateral \nsecond molar sites are a beneit to increase the A-P distance \nof the implants, which counters the anterior bite forces that \nmay be increased from parafunction and so on (Fig. 3.67). A \ngreater number of implants are generally required in the \nmaxilla to compensate for the less dense bone and more \nFIG 3.65 The anteroposterior (A-P) spread of implants is deter-\nmined by drawing a line from the distal of the last implant on \neach side and a parallel line through the middle of the most \nanterior implant. \n5. Opposing dentition\na. Denture: lowest force\nb. Natural teeth: intermediate force\nc. Implant ixed prosthesis: higher forces\nNot all patient force factors have the same risk.\nIn conclusion, whenever the patient force factors are greater \nthan usual, additional implants should be added to support \nthe prosthesis. Of the patient force factors, severe bruxism \nis the most signiicant followed by clenching and CHS, region \nof the mouth, masticatory dynamics, and the opposing arch.\nInluence of Bone Density on Implant Number\nThe additional number of implants after the key implant sites \nare established is also related to the density of bone. The \nsoftest bone type (D4) has (1) the lowest strength and may \nbe 10 times weaker than the strongest bone type on a scale of \n1 to 10 for bone strength (D4 bone is a 1 or 2); (2) the greatest \nbiomechanical mismatch with its modulus of elasticity com-\npared with titanium; (3) the lowest bone-implant contact \n(≈25%) and higher stresses (stress = force/area); and (4) \nstrains in the bone are transmitted not only at the crest but \nalso along the entire bone-implant surface.\nThe soft bone type (D3) has (1) a low bone strength, which \nis 50% weaker than hard bone (D2) (on a 10-point scale, \nits strength is a 3 to 4); (2) intermediate difference of modulus \nof elasticity compared with titanium; (3) low bone-implant \ncontact (≈50%); and (4) strain patterns at the crestal half of the \nimplant.\nThe hard bone (D2) has (1) ideal strength (a 7 to 8 on a \n10-point scale), (2) high bone-implant contact (≈75%), (3) \nmore stiff modulus of elasticity, and (4) strain patterns pri-\nmarily at the crestal region of the implant. The hardest bone \n(D1) has the best biomechanical features of (1) strength (9 \nto 10 on a 10-point scale), (2) highest bone-implant contact \n(above 85%), (3) stiffest modulus of elasticity, and (4) strain \nvalues above the irst thread.\nAs the bone quality is reduced, the number of implants to \nsupport the prosthesis should increase. The risk factor scale \nfor bone density is inversely related to the strength of the \nbone scale. D4 bone is a 10, D3 bone is an 8, D2 bone is a 4, \nand D1 bone is a 2. When the implants are inserted into D4 \nbone, a larger-diameter or another implant is suggested, \ndepending on the number of teeth replaced. A full-arch ixed \nrestoration in the mandible with D2 bone may often have ive \nimplants, but in D4 bone, nine implants may be appropriate. \nThe total number of implants is related to the key implant \npositions plus the inluence of the patient force factors and \nthe quality of bone.\nIn conclusion, the decision for the number of implants in \nthe treatment plan begins with the implants in the ideal key \npositions. Additional numbers are most often required and \nare primarily related to the patient force factors or to bone \ndensity in the edentulous sites. For example, a young, large \nman who bruxes severely with greater-than-normal CHS in \nthe posterior regions of the mouth opposing an implant res-\ntoration will require one implant for each missing root (two \nimplants for each molar).

These same forces, when applied to implant \nprostheses, have been shown to be very harmful.\nGeneral Complications\nThe lack of rigid ixation during implant healing may be a \nresult of parafunction on soft tissue–borne prostheses overly-\ning the submerged implant (e.g., interim prosthesis). The \nmost common cause of both early and late implant failure \nafter successful surgical ixation is the result of parafunction. \nSuch complications occur with greater frequency in the \nmaxilla because of a decrease in bone density and an increase \nin the moment of force. The presence of these parafunctional \nconditions must be carefully noted during the early phases of \ntreatment planning.\nClassiication\nThe classiication of parafunction involves (1) bruxism, (2) \nclenching, and (3) tongue thrust or increased size. The dental \nliterature usually does not identify bruxism and clenching \nas separate entities. Although several aspects of treatment \nare similar, their diagnosis and treatment are in some ways \ndifferent.\nBruxism and clenching are the most critical factors to \nevaluate in any implant reconstruction. Long-term success \nwill not be achieved with severe parafunction of bruxism or \nclenching. The implant clinician should always try to diag-\nnose the presence of these two conditions.\nThis does not mean that patients with moderate and \nsevere parafunction are absolute contraindications to implant \ntreatment. Because patients with moderate to severe para-\nfunction represent so many additional risks in implant den-\ntistry, one must be aware of these conditions and the methods \nto reduce their noxious effects on the entire implant-related \nsystem. Unfortunately, parafunction may be a dificult entity \nto diagnose, especially if the patient is completely edentulous \nand is wearing a recently fabricated prosthesis.\nBruxism.

The symptoms of this \ndisorder may be ascertained by a dental history and may \ninclude repeated headaches, a history (or presence) of frac-\ntured teeth or restorations, repeated uncemented restora-\ntions, or jaw discomfort upon awakening. When the patient \nis aware of muscle tenderness or the spouse is conscious of \nthe noise of bruxism during sleep, the diagnosis is readily \nobtained. However, many patients do not attribute these \nproblems to excessive forces on the teeth and report a nega-\ntive history. A lack of these symptoms does not negate the \npossibility of bruxism (Box 3.8).\nClinical signs. Fortunately, many clinical signs of bruxism \nwarn of excessive grinding.

Fortunately, the bite force does not continue \nto increase in most bruxing patients. When muscles do not \nvary their exercise regimen, their size and function adjust to \nthe dynamics of the situation. As a result, the higher bite \nforces and muscle size usually do not continue in an unend-\ning spiral.\nDiagnosis.

A physical examination for the implant \ncandidate should include palpation of the muscles of masti-\ncation including the masseter, temporalis, and internal and \nexternal pterygoid muscles. Hyperactive or hypertrophied \nmuscles are the most common sign of bruxing. The lateral \npterygoid muscle is more often overused by the bruxing \npatient and is often dificult to palpate. The ipsilateral medial \npterygoid muscle provides more reliable information in this \nregion. It acts as the antagonist to the lateral pterygoid in \nhyperfunction and, when tender, provides a good indicator \nof overuse of the lateral pterygoid.36 However, the most effec-\ntive method to diagnose bruxism is to evaluate the wearing \nof the natural teeth. Nonfunctional wear facets on the incisal \nedges occur most often on natural teeth rather than on \ncrowns made of porcelain or metal occlusal, especially in the \nanterior mandible and maxillary canines. Enamel opposing \nenamel causes more occlusal material wear than almost any \nother combination (e.g., enamel opposing metal, metal \nopposing metal, etc.).37 As a result, in a partially edentulous \npatient, enamel wear is easily observed in the bruxing patient.\nNot only is enamel wear the easiest method to determine \nbruxism in a dentate patient but Misch has noted the disorder \nmay also be classiied as absent, mild, moderate, or severe. \nNo anterior wear patterns in the teeth signiies an absence \nof signiicant bruxism.

The clench position most often is in the same repeated \nposition and rarely changes from one period to another. The \ndirection of load may be vertical or horizontal. The forces \ninvolved are in signiicant excess of normal physiologic loads \nand are similar to bruxism in amount and duration; however, \nseveral clinical conditions differ in clenching.39\nDiagnosis. Many clinical symptoms and signs warn of \nexcessive grinding. However, the signs of clenching are often \nless obvious. The forces generated during clenching are usually \ndirected more vertically to the plane of occlusion, at least in \nthe posterior regions of the mouth. Wearing of the teeth is \nusually not evident, and clenching often is not diagnosed \nduring the intraoral examination. As a result, the clinician \nmust be more observant to the diagnosis of this disorder.\nClinical signs. Many of the clinical signs of clenching \nresemble bruxism. When a patient has a dental history or \npresence of muscle tenderness (often upon awakening) or \ntooth sensitivity to cold, parafunction is strongly suspected. \nIn the absence of tooth wear, clenching is the prime suspect. \nTooth mobility, temporalis, lateral pterygoid, or masseter \nmuscle tenderness or hypertrophy, deviation of the mandible \nduring occlusal opening, limited opening, stress lines in \nenamel, cervical abfraction, and material fatigue (enamel, \nenamel pits, porcelain and implant components) are all asso-\nciated clinical signs of clenching.40 When the clinical signs of \nexcessive force appear on the teeth, muscles, or joint in the \nabsence of incisal wear, clenching is strongly suspected.\nA most common clinical inding of clenching is a scal-\nloped border of the tongue. The tongue is often braced against \nthe lingual surfaces of the maxillary or mandibular teeth \nduring clenching, exerting lateral pressures and resulting in \nthe scalloped border. This tongue thrust position may also be \naccompanied by an intraoral vacuum, which permits a clench \nto extend for a considerable time, often during sleep. When \nthe clinician asks the patient to open wide to evaluate \nmaximum occlusal opening (while palpating the temporo-\nmandibular joint [TMJ]), the lateral tongue contour is \nobserved to notice any scalloped border (Box 3.10).\nClinical exam. Muscle evaluation for clenching (and \nbruxism) includes deviation during opening of the jaw, \nlimited opening, and tenderness of the TMJ. Deviation to one \nside during opening indicates a muscle imbalance on the \nsame side.36 Limited opening is easily evaluated and may indi-\ncate muscular imbalance or degenerative joint disease. The \nnormal opening should be at least 40 mm from the maxillary \nincisal edge to the mandibular incisal edge in an Angle Class \nI patient, taking into consideration an overjet or overlap. If \nany horizontal overjet or overlap exists, its value in millime-\nters is subtracted from the 40-mm minimum opening mea-\nsurement.41 The range of opening without regard for overlap \nor overjet has been measured in the range of 38 to 65 mm for \nmen and 36 to 60 mm for women from incisal edge to edge.42\nIncreased mobility of teeth may be an indication of a force \nbeyond physiologic limits, bone loss, or their combination. \nThis requires further investigation in regard to parafunction \nBOX 3.10 Clenching: Clinical Signs\n• History or presence of temporalis, lateral pterygoid, or \nmasseter muscle tenderness (often upon awakening)\n• Tooth sensitivity\n• Tooth mobility\n• Temporalis, lateral pterygoid, or masseter muscle \nhypertrophy\n• Deviation of mandible during opening\n• Limited opening – pain on opening\n• Stress lines in enamel\n• Cervical abfraction\n• Material fracture (enamel pits, restorations) – porcelain \nfracture\n• Scalloped border of tongue – presence of antegonial notch \nat the angle of the mandible\nand is very important if an implant may be placed in the \nregion of the mobile teeth. The rigid implant may receive \nmore than its share of occlusal force when surrounded by \nmobile teeth. Fremitus, a vibration type of mobility of a \ntooth, is often present in the clenching patient. To evaluate \nthis condition, the dentist’s inger barely contacts the facial \nsurface of one tooth at a time and feels for vibrations while \nthe patient taps the teeth together. Fremitus is symptomatic \nof a local excess of occlusal loads.\nCervical erosion is often a sign of parafunctional clenching \n(Fig. 3.73). The notched appearance of the cervical portion \nof the tooth directly correlates with the concentration of \nforces shown in three-dimensional inite analysis and photo-\nelasticity studies.43 Abfraction of teeth was also observed in \ncats, rats, and marmosets and was described in the literature \nas early as 1930. A study of a noninstitutionalized older \nhuman population revealed that cervical abrasion was present \nin 56% of the participants.44\nComplications\nPostoperative care. A common cause of implant failure \nduring healing is parafunction in a patient wearing a soft \ntissue–supported prosthesis over a submerged implant. The \ntissue overlying the implant is compressed during the para-\nfunction episode. The premature loading may cause micro-\nmovement of the implant body in the bone and may \ncompromise osteointegration. When an overlying soft tissue–\nborne restoration exerts pressure as a result of parafunction, \npressure necrosis causes soft tissue dehiscence over the \nimplant. This condition is not corrected by surgically cover-\ning the implant with soft tissue, but the soft tissue support \nregion of the prosthesis over the implant should be gener-\nously relieved during the healing period whenever parafunc-\ntion is noted. With metal-free partial dentures, this may \nweaken the prosthesis leading to possible fractures.\nTreatment Planning for Parafunction Patients \n(Clenching/Bruxism)\nProgressive Bone Loading.

(A) A common sign \nis scalloping of the tongue, which results from tongue protru-\nsion during clenching. (B) Antegonial notch, which results \nfrom massetter hypertrophy. (C) Prosthesis fracture resulting \nfrom excessive biomechanical force. \nA\nB\nC\nprovide additional time to produce load-bearing bone around \nthe implants through progressive bone-loading techniques.45 \nBy utilizing the progressive bone loading technique, poorer \nbone density is transformed into better quality bone, which is \nmore ideal for excessive occlusal loads.\nGreater Surface Area. Anterior implants that are subjected \nto parafunctional forces are problematic because they are \nusually nonaxial or shear forces. To counteract this excessive \nforce the use of wider-diameter implants or additional \nnumber of implants (i.e., greater surface area) should be \ntreatment planned.\nOcclusion. With parafunctional habits, the occlusion must \nbe strictly designed and monitored. Ideally, the patient should \nbe maintained in a canine guided occlusion, as long as the \ncanines are healthy. Mutually protected occlusion, with addi-\ntional anterior implants or teeth distributing forces, is devel-\noped if the implants are in the canine position or if this tooth \nis restored as a pontic. The anterior teeth may be modiied to \nrecreate the proper incisal guidance and avoid posterior inter-\nferences during excursions.\nThe elimination of posterior lateral occlusal contacts (i.e., \nnonaxial loading) during excursive movements is recom-\nmended when opposing natural teeth or an implant or tooth-\nsupported ixed prosthesis. This is beneicial in two aspects: \n(a) because lateral forces dramatically increase stress at the \nimplant-bone interface, the elimination of posterior contacts \ndiminishes the negative effect of angled forces during bruxism, \nand (b) the presence of posterior contacts during excursions, \nand almost all ibers of the masseter, temporalis, and the \nexternal pterygoid muscles contract and place higher forces \non the anterior teeth and implants. On the contrary, during \nexcursions in the absence of posterior contacts, fewer ibers \nof the temporalis and masseter muscles are stimulated, and \nthe forces applied on the anterior implant–teeth system are \nreduced by as much as two thirds.\nProsthesis Design. The prosthesis may be designed to \nimprove the distribution of stress throughout the implant \nsystem with centric vertical contacts aligned with the long \naxis of the implant whenever possible. Narrow posterior \nocclusal tables to prevent inadvertent lateral forces and to \ndecrease the occlusal forces are beneicial. Enamoplasty of the \ncusp tips of the opposing natural teeth is indicated to \nhelp improve the direction of vertical forces within the guide-\nlines of the intended occlusion (i.e., improve plane of \nocclusion) newer occlusal materials (e.g., zirconia). Wider \nimplant bodies, harder cement types (e.g., zinc phosphate vs. \nzinc oxide), titanium alloy implant bodies, and more implants \nsplinted together are all beneicial.\nOcclusal Guard. The most important treatment for a \npatient with parafunctional habits is the use of an occlusal \nguard. Ideally, patients should wear a hard, processed acrylic \nocclusal guard at night. The guard will absorb the majority \nof the parafunctional forces, reducing the damaging forces to \nthe implant system. Patients should also be instructed to \nwear the guard during any time they might exhibit parafunc-\ntion, such as stressful time periods, driving, and working at a \ncomputer.\nTongue Thrust and Size. Parafunctional tongue thrust is the \nunnatural force of the tongue against the teeth during swal-\nlowing. A force of approximately 41 to 709 g/cm2 on the ante-\nrior and lateral areas of the palate has been recorded during \nswallowing.46 These forces may cause clinical complications."

Because of the openbite, the patient has no anterior \nguidance with mandibular excursions. \nTypes. Several different types of tongue thrust have been \nidentiied; anterior, intermediate, posterior, and either unilat-\neral or bilateral, which may be found and in almost any \ncombination (Fig. 3.74). To evaluate anterior tongue thrust, \nthe doctor holds the lower lip down, squirts water into the \nmouth with the water syringe, and asks the patient to swallow. \nA normal patient forms a vacuum in the mouth by position-\ning the tongue on the anterior aspect of the palate and is able \nto swallow without dificulty. A patient with an anterior \ntongue thrust is not able to create the vacuum needed to \nswallow when the lower lip is retracted because the seal and \nvacuum for the patient are achieved between the tongue and \nthe lower lip. As a consequence, the patient is unable to \nswallow while the lower lip is withdrawn.\nA posterior tongue thrust is evaluated by retracting one \ncheek at a time away from the posterior teeth or edentulous \nregion with a mouth mirror, injecting water into the mouth \nwith a water syringe and asking the patient to swallow. \nVisual evidence of the tongue during deglutition may also be \naccompanied by pressure against the mirror and conirms a \nlateral force.\nComplications\nEarly loading. Although the force of tongue thrust is of \nlesser intensity than in other parafunctional forces, it is hori-\nzontal and can increase stress at the permucosal site of the \nimplant. This is most critical for one-stage surgical approaches \nand immediate restoration of implants in which the implants \nare in an elevated position at initial placement and the \nimplant interface is in an early healing phase. If the natural \nteeth in the region of the tongue thrust were lost as a result \nof an aberrant tongue position or movement, the implants \nare at increased risk during initial healing and early prosthetic \nloading (Box 3.11).\nIncision line opening. The tongue thrust may also con-\ntribute to incision line opening after bone grafting or implant \nsurgery, which may compromise both the hard and soft \ntissues. This is especially noteworthy in a bone augmentation \nprocedure.\nBOX 3.11 Parafunction: Tongue Thrust \nand Size\n1. Tongue thrust\na. Less force than bruxism or clenching\nb. Is constant\nc.

A tongue-thrust habit may lead to \ntooth movement or mobility, which is of consequence when \nimplants are present in the same quadrant. If the remaining \nteeth exhibit increased mobility, the implant prosthesis may \nbe subject to increased occlusal loads.\nInadequate tongue room. A potential prosthetic com-\nplication for a patient with a lateral tongue thrust is the \ncomplaint of inadequate room for the tongue after the \nmandibular implants are restored. A prosthetic mistake is to \nreduce the width of the lingual contour of the mandibular \nteeth to give the tongue more space. The lingual cusp of the \nrestored mandibular posterior teeth should follow the curve \nof Wilson and have a proper horizontal overjet to protect \nthe tongue during function. A reduction in the width of the \nmandibular posterior teeth often increases the occurrence \nof tongue biting and may not dissipate with time. When the \nlingual surface of the mandibular restoration is reduced, the \nentire prosthesis may need to be refabricated. The restoring \ndentist should identify the tongue position before treatment \nand inform the patient about the early learning curve for \nthe tongue once the teeth are delivered on the implants \n(Fig. 3.75).\nComplication prevention. Even in the absence of tongue \nthrust, the tongue often accommodates to the available space, \nand its size may increase with the loss of teeth. As a result, a \npatient not wearing a mandibular denture often has a larger-\nthan-normal tongue. The placement of implants and pros-\nthetic teeth in such a patient results in an increase in lateral \nforce, which may be continuous. The patient then complains \nof inadequate room for the tongue and may bite it during \nfunction. However, this condition is usually short lived, \nand the patient eventually adapts to the new intraoral condi-\ntion. However, it has been observed a ixed restoration is \nmore advantageous for this type of patient. If the patient has \na RP-5 prosthesis, it should be turned into an RP-4: An RP-5 \nrestoration is much less stable in patients with tongue thrust \nor size issues, and patient complaints are more common with \nremovable restorations in general."

The anterior mandibu-\nlar CHS is usually measured from the crest of the ridge to the \nmandibular incisal edge.

When the crest of the ridge resorbs, avail-\nable bone height is also decreased, and the CHS is increased. \nThe potential length of the implant is often reduced in exces-\nsive CHS conditions (i.e., because of vital structures), and the \nmore lingual implant position results in offset loads (i.e., \nbiomechanical disadvantage).\nThe vertical distance from the occlusal plane to the oppos-\ning landmark for implant insertion is typically a constant in \nan individual (with the exception of the posterior maxilla \nbecause the sinus cavity expands more rapidly than crestal \nbone resorption in height). As the bone resorbs, the crown \nheight becomes larger, but the available bone height decreases \n(Fig. 3.80). An indirect relationship is found between the \nprosthesis and implant height. Moderate bone loss before \nimplant placement may result in a crown height–bone height \nratio greater than 1, with greater lateral forces applied to the \ncrestal bone than in abundant bone (in which the crown \nheight is less). A linear relationship exists between the applied \nload and internal stresses within the bone.51 Therefore, the \ngreater the load applied, the greater the tensile and compres-\nsive stresses transmitted at the bone interface and to the pros-\nthetic components.

Using gingival-colored prosthetic \nmaterials (pink porcelain, acrylic resin, or stained zirconia) \non ixed restorations or changing the prosthetic design to a \nremovable restoration should often be considered when the \nprosthesis is used to restore excessive CHS (Fig. 3.83).\nIn the maxilla, a vertical loss of bone results in a more \npalatal ridge position. As a consequence, implants are often \ninserted more palatal than the natural tooth position. Remov-\nable restorations have several advantages under these clinical \ncircumstances. The removable prosthesis does not require \nembrasures for hygiene. The removable restoration may be \nremoved during sleep to decrease the effects of an increase in \nCHS on nocturnal parafunction. The removable restoration \nmay improve the lip and facial support, which is usually dei-\ncient because of the advanced bone loss. The overdenture may \nhave suficient bulk of acrylic resin to decrease the risk of \nprosthesis fracture and allow for ease of repair. The increase in \nCHS permits ideal denture tooth placement without infringe-\nment of the implant-prosthetic substructure.\nThe excessive CHS on a RP-5 prosthesis often makes the \nrestoration more unstable and often requires more soft tissue \nsupport. In RP-5 overdentures, there are two different com-\nponents of the CHS: (1) the distance from the crest of the \nridge to the height of the overdenture attachment and (2) the \ndistance from the overdenture attachment to the occlusal \nplane. The greater the distance from the attachment to the \nocclusal plane, the more force on the prosthesis to move or \nrotate on the attachment and the greater the prosthesis \nmobility (and less the stability). Therefore, more tissue \nsupport, (i.e., buccal shelf) is required during function. If the \nprosthesis loads the soft tissue incorrectly, sore spots may \noccur and may accelerate the posterior bone loss (Fig. 3.84).\nAn increase in the biomechanical forces is in direct relation-\nship to the increase in CHS. The treatment plan of the implant \nrestoration should consider stress-reducing options whenever \nthe CHS is increased. Methods to decrease stress include:\n1. Shorten cantilever length.\n2. Minimize offset loads to the buccal or lingual.\nFIG 3.83 When the crown height space is greater than \n12 mm, pink porcelain (or acrylic) is often used to replace the \nsoft tissue drape in the prosthesis. (From Misch CE: Dental \nimplant prosthetics, ed 2, St Louis, 2015, Mosby.)\nFIG 3.84 A RP-5 overdenture is usually less stable when the \ncrown height space (CHS) is large. The CHS of the prosthesis \nis measured from the occlusal plane to the height of the \noverdenture attachments. (From Misch CE: Dental implant \nprosthetics, ed 2, St Louis, 2015, Mosby.)\n3. Increase the number of implants.\n4. Increase the diameters of implants.\n5. Utilize implants with maximum surface area.\n6. Fabricate removable restorations that are less retentive and \nincorporate soft tissue support (e.g., buccal shelf).\n7. Remove the removable restoration during sleeping hours \nto reduce the noxious effects of nocturnal parafunction.\n8. Splint implants together, whether they support a ixed or \nremovable prosthesis.\nCrown height space is a considerable force magniier; the \ngreater the crown height, the shorter the prosthetic cantilever \nthat should extend from the implant support system. When \nthe CHS is greater than 15 mm, no cantilever should be con-\nsidered unless all other force factors are minimal. The occlu-\nsal contact intensity should be reduced on any offset load \nfrom the implant support system. Occlusal contacts in centric \nrelation occlusion may even be eliminated on the most pos-\nterior aspect (or offset region) of a cantilever. In this way a \nparafunction load may be reduced because the most cantile-\nvered portion of the prosthesis is only loaded during func-\ntional activity (e.g., chewing).52\nARCH POSITION\nPOSTERIOR HAS HIGHER FORCES\nThe arch position is an important part of the treatment plan-\nning process and has a signiicant impact on the amount of \nforce generated to an implant prosthesis. In general, the \nmaximum biting force is greater in the molar region and \ndecreases as measurements progress anteriorly. Maximum \nbite forces in the anterior incisor region correspond to \napproximately 35 to 50 psi, those in the canine region range \nfrom 47 to 100 psi, and those in the molar area vary from 127 \nto 250 psi (Fig. 3.85).53 Mansour et al evaluated occlusal \nforces and moments mathematically using a class III lever \narm, the condyles being the fulcrum and the masseter and \ntemporalis muscles supplying the force.54 The forces at the"

Not only is the bone generally \ndenser in the anterior mandible, but the direction of force \nis also more in the long axis for the lower anterior teeth. \nThe angled load of 12 to 15 degrees in maxillary anterior \nimplants increases the force by approximately 25%. Note that \nthe maxillary anterior teeth are wider in diameter and have \ngreater surface area compared with the smallest teeth in the \nmouth, the mandibular incisors. The amount of force is \nsimilar, but the direction of force places the maxillary teeth \nmore at risk.\nArch position includes the maxillary arch vs. the mandibu-\nlar arch. As previously mentioned the bone in the mandible \nis more often more dense than that of the maxilla, especially \nin the posterior regions. The edentulous maxilla with a poorer \nbone density requires more implants or larger widths \ncompared with the edentulous mandible. It is interesting to \nnote that the maxillary dentition has more roots and \ngreater surface area roots than the mandibular counterparts \n(Box 3.13). Yet, in the edentulous maxilla, there is less avail-\nable bone height than any region because the maxillary sinus \nquickly expands to decrease bone height.\nComplications\nGreater Bone Loss. In a study by Chung et al with 339 \nimplants in 69 patients in function for an average of 8.1 years \n(range, 3–24 years), the posterior implants (even with kera-\ntinized mucosa) showed a 3.5-fold greater average bone loss \nper year than anterior implants.55 In the region of higher bite \nforces, greater bone loss may be evident. The anterior biting \nforce is decreased in the absence of posterior tooth contact \nand greater in the presence of posterior occlusion or eccentric \ncontacts. Besides the mechanical properties of a class III lever \nfunction, there also is a biologic component to decrease bite \nFIG 3.85 The maximum bite forces are greater in the poste-\nrior regions of the jaws compared with the anterior regions. \n(From Misch CE: Dental implant prosthetics, ed 2, St Louis, \n2015, Mosby.)\nforce in the anterior regions. When the posterior teeth are in \ncontact, the large masticatory muscles contract. When the \nposterior teeth are not in contact, two thirds of the temporalis \nand masseter muscles do not contract their ibers, which \nresult in the biting force being reduced.\nDecreased Surface Area. In the anterior regions with less \nforce, the anterior natural tooth roots are smaller in diameter \nand root surface area compared with posterior teeth. The \ngreatest increase in natural tooth surface area occurs in the \nmolar region, with a 200% increase compared with the premo-\nlars. Yet in implant dentistry, we primarily determine the \nimplant length by existing bone volume and place longer \nimplants in the anterior region and shorter implants in the \nposterior regions (or cantilever off the anterior implants, \nwhich results in posterior bite forces magniied by the cantile-\nver length). This approach should be corrected to conform to \nthe biomechanical load similar to that observed with natural \nteeth. However, the length of an implant is less effective to dis-\nsipate force. Instead, implant width and design are more effec-\ntive. The best option to decrease stress is to increase implant \nnumber. Implants in the posterior regions should often be of \ngreater diameter or greater number (because molars have more \nroots), especially in the presence of additional force factors.\nPoorer Bone Density Resulting in Less Support. The natural \nteeth are surrounded by a thin cortical plate of bone and \nperiodontal complex, which is similar for all teeth and arch \npositions. However, after the teeth are lost, the bone density \nin the edentulous site is reduced and is often different for each \nregion of the mouth. The posterior regions, in general, form \nless bone density after tooth loss than the anterior regions, \nwith the anterior maxilla less dense than the mandible. The \nmandibular anterior implant sites beneit from denser bone \nthan the maxillary anterior implant sites.

In other words, the edentulous bone \ndensity is inversely related to the amount of force and surface \narea of the natural tooth roots generally applied in that arch \nposition. As a result, the posterior maxilla is the most at-risk \narch position followed by the posterior mandible and then \nthe anterior maxilla. The most ideal region for implant stress \ntransfer within the physiologic loading zone for bone is the \nmandibular anterior region.56\nOPPOSING ARCH\nAn often overlooked factor in the treatment planning process is \nthe opposing arch. In general, natural teeth transmit greater \nimpact forces through occlusal contacts than soft tissue–borne \ncomplete dentures. In addition, the maximum occlusal force of \npatients with complete dentures is limited and may range from \n5 to 26 psi.57 The force is usually greater in recent denture wearers \nand decreases with time. Muscle atrophy, thinning of the oral \ntissues with age or disease, and bone atrophy often occur in \nedentulous patients as a function of time.58 Some denture \nwearers may clench on their prosthesis constantly, which may \nmaintain muscle mass, but will usually result in bone loss.\nThe maximum force generated against an implant pros-\nthesis is related to the number of teeth or implants support-\ning the prosthesis in the opposing arch. Partially edentulous \ndentate patients have less force than dentate patients with all \nof their teeth. Patients with partial dentures may have forces \nintermediate between those of natural teeth and complete \ndentures, depending on the location and condition of the \nremaining teeth, muscles, and joints. In partially edentulous \npatients with implant-supported ixed prostheses, force \nranges are more similar to those of natural dentition, but lack \nof proprioception may magnify the load amount during \nparafunctional and functional activity (Fig. 3.86).\nA complete implant ixed prosthesis does not beneit from \nproprioception as do natural teeth, and patients chew food \nwith a force four times greater than with natural teeth. The \nhighest forces are created with implant prostheses in the \nopposing arch. An RP-4 overdenture may have some move-\nment compared with a ixed prosthesis and is more likely to \nhave acrylic or resin teeth. Hence, the bite force is slightly less \nthan for a full arch ixed implant prosthesis. In addition, \npremature contacts in occlusal patterns or during parafunc-\ntion on the implant prostheses do not alter the pathway of \nclosure because occlusal awareness is decreased with implant \nprostheses compared with natural teeth. Continued stress \nincreases can be expected to occur with the implant restora-\ntion (Box 3.14).\nThe opposing arch is not as major a factor to alter an \nimplant treatment plan as parafunction, masticatory dynam-\nics, or excessive CHS, but is a major factor for the risk of \nporcelain or prosthesis fracture. In a report by Kinsel and Lin, \nthe opposing dentition varies the incidence of porcelain frac-\nture to an implant crown.59 When the opposing arch was a \ndenture, 0% fracture of the implant crowns in the opposing \narch was found. The opposing dentition of a natural tooth \nfound 3.2% fracture of implant crowns. The opposing \nFIG 3.86 Opposing arch. Greatest forces from high to low. (A) Implant-supported ixed prosthe-\nsis.

Whereas a tapering arch form may \nsupport a 20-mm cantilever, a square arch form requires the \ncantilever to be reduced to 12 mm or less. A tapering arch \nform is most ideal, and a square arch form is susceptible to \nforce-related complications.\nThe A-P spread is only one of the force factors to be con-\nsidered for the extent of the distal cantilever. If the stress \nfactors are high (e.g., parafunction, crown height, mastica-\ntory musculature dynamics, opposing arch), the cantilever \nlength of a prosthesis should be reduced and may even be \ncontraindicated.\nBONE DENSITY\nTREATMENT PLANNING\nThe external (cortical) and internal (trabecular) structure of \nbone may be described in terms of quality or density, which \nrelects a number of biomechanical properties, such as \nstrength, modulus of elasticity, bone-implant contact (BIC) \npercent, and stress distribution around a loaded endosteal \nimplant (Box 3.16). The external and internal architecture of \nbone controls and dictates virtually the surgical and pros-\nthetic protocol for the patient. The density of available bone \nin an edentulous site is a determining factor in treatment \nplanning, surgical approach, implant design, healing time, \nand the need for initial progressive bone loading during pros-\nthetic reconstruction.56\ndentition of a crown on a natural tooth found a 5.7% fracture \nof the opposing implant crown. A 16.2% fracture was \nobserved when an implant crown opposed an implant crown. \nWhen the percentage of patients with major fractures of por-\ncelain were compared to the percentage with no fractures, the \nincidence of patients with porcelain fractures of implant \ncrowns was 19.4% for natural teeth and 69.5% of patients \nwith implant crowns in the opposing arch. Therefore, the \nopposing dentition may increase the impact force, and the \ngreater the force, the higher the risk of porcelain fracture \n(Box 3.15).\nAs a consequence of the opposing arch affecting the inten-\nsity of forces applied to an implant prosthesis, the treatment \nplan may be modiied to reduce the risk of fatigue fracture \nand overload. Rarely should the opposing arch be maintained \nin a traditional denture as a method to decrease the stress to \nthe implant arch. Unfortunately, many edentulous patients \nopt to remain in a denture for the maxillary arch as a conse-\nquence of the increased costs associated with implant pros-\ntheses. However, the patient should be aware of the continued \nbone loss in the maxillary edentulous arch, and a preferred \ntreatment is an implant-supported prosthesis in both arches \nin order to maintain the existing bone volume.\nARCH FORM\nThe patient’s arch form should always be evaluated in the \ntreatment planning process, especially in the mandibular \narch. There exist many variations on the size and shape of \npatients’ arch forms. The distance from the center of the most \nanterior implant to a line joining the distal aspect of the two \nmost distal implants on each side is called the anteroposterior \n(A-P) distance or the A-P spread (Fig. 3.87).60 The greater the \nA-P spread (Fig. 3.87),60 theorectically the farther the distal \ncantilever may be extended to replace the missing posterior \nteeth, which minimizes force-related issues. As a general rule, \nwhen ive to six anterior implants are placed in the anterior \nmandible between the foramina to support a ixed prosthesis, \nthe cantilever should not exceed two times the A-P spread, \nwith all other stress factors being low.\nThe A-P distance is directly affected by the arch form. The \ntypes of arch forms may be separated into square, ovoid, and \ntapering. A square arch form in the anterior mandible has a \n0- to 6-mm A-P spread between the most distal and most \nanterior implants (Fig. 3.88).

The initial treatment plan is \npresented to the patient using the anatomic location as an \nindex of the bone density: anterior mandible and single tooth \nreplacement is D2, anterior maxilla and posterior mandible \nis D3, and posterior maxilla is D4. After the initial treatment \nevaluation of the osseous structures are taken into consider-\nation (e.g., prosthesis type and design, implant key position, \nand patient force factors), a more complete treatment plan \nrelative to bone density is obtained by a CBCT scan or modi-\nied during the surgical procedure using the tactile method \nto determine bone density.\nUnderstanding the Basics of Bone\nBone is an organ that is able to change in relation to a number \nof factors, including hormones, vitamins, and mechanical \ninluences. However, biomechanical parameters, such as the \namount of strain transmitted to bone, are predominant. \nAwareness of this adaptability in the skeletal system has been \nreported for more than a century. In 1887, Meier qualitatively \ndescribed the architecture of trabecular bone in the femur.61 \nIn 1888 Kulmann noticed the similarity between the pattern \nof trabecular bone in the femur and tension trajectories in \nconstruction beam concepts used by Eiffel (Fig. 3.91).62 Wolff, \nin 1892, further elaborated on these concepts and published: \n“Every change in the form and function of bone or of its \nfunction alone is followed by certain deinite changes in the \ninternal architecture, and equally deinite alteration in its \nexternal conformation, in accordance with mathematical \nlaws.”63 It has been widely reported that, in the structural \nskeleton, the external architecture of bone (cortical bone) \nchanges in relation to function, and the internal bony struc-\nture (trabecular bone) is also modiied (Wolff’s Law).\nThe structural changes in bone as a consequence of \nmechanical inluences have also been noted in the jaws. As an \nexample, both MacMillan and Paritt have reported on the \nstructural characteristics and variation of trabeculae in the \nalveolar regions of the jaws.64 The maxilla and mandible have \ndifferent biomechanical functions (Fig. 3.92). The mandible, \nas an independent structure, is designed as a force-absorption \nunit. When teeth are present, the outer cortical bone is much \ndenser and thicker, and the trabecular bone is more coarse and \ndense (Fig. 3.93). This bony architectural make-up is in direct \nrelation to the force applied. On the other hand, the maxilla is \nFIG 3.91 The proximal head of the femur has trabecular bone \naligned along stress pathways, similar to beams for a bridge \nor tower.

As a consequence, the maxilla has a thin cortical plate \nand ine trabecular bone surrounding the teeth (Fig. 3.94). \nWhen evaluating bone quality around natural teeth, Neufeld \nnoted that the bone is most dense around the teeth (cribri-\nform plate) and more dense around the teeth at the crest \ncompared with the regions around the apices (Fig. 3.95).65\nOrban demonstrated a decrease in the trabecular bone \npattern around a maxillary molar with no opposing occlusion \ncompared with a tooth with occlusal contacts on the contra-\nlateral side (Fig. 3.96).66 Bone density in the jaws also decreases \nafter tooth loss. This loss is primarily related to the length of \ntime the region has been edentulous and not loaded appro-\npriately, the initial density of the bone, lexure and torsion in \nthe mandible, and parafunction before and after tooth loss. \nIn general, the density change after tooth loss is greatest in \nthe posterior maxilla and least in the anterior mandible.\nCortical and trabecular bone throughout the body is con-\nstantly modiied by either modeling or remodeling. Modeling \nhas independent sites of formation and resorption and results \nin the change of the shape or size of bone. Remodeling is a \nprocess of resorption and formation at the same site that \nreplaces previously existing bone and primarily affects the \ninternal turnover of bone, including that region where \nteeth are lost or the bone next to an endosteal implant. These \nadaptive phenomena have been associated with the alteration \nof the mechanical stress and strain environment within the \nhost bone.67\nStress is determined by the magnitude of force divided by \nthe functional area over which it is applied. Strain is deined \nas the change in length of a material divided by the original \nlength. The greater the magnitude of stress applied to the \nbone, the greater the strain observed in the bone.18 Bone \nmodeling and remodeling are primarily controlled, in part or \nwhole, by the mechanical environment of strain. Overall, the \ndensity of alveolar bone evolves as a result of mechanical \ndeformation from microstrain.\nFrost proposed a model of modeling/remodeling patterns \nfor compact bone as it relates to mechanical adaptation to \nstrain.68 Spontaneous fracture, the pathologic overload zone, \nmild overload zone, adapted window, and acute disuse \nwindow were described for bone in relation to the amount of \nthe microstrain experienced (Box 3.17). These categories also \nmay be used to describe the trabecular bone response next to \na dental implant in the jaws.\nWith disuse atrophy, bone loses mineral density, and disuse \natrophy occurs because modeling for new bone is inhibited \nFIG 3.94 The dentate maxilla has a iner trabecular pattern \ncompared with the mandible.

Bone \nturnover is required in the adapted window; Mori and Burr \nprovide evidence of remodeling in regions of bone microfrac-\nture from fatigue damage within the physiologic range.72\nThe mild overload zone (1500–3000 microstrain) causes a \ngreater rate of fatigue microfracture and increase in the cel-\nlular turnover rate of bone. As a result, the bone strength and \ndensity decrease. The histologic description of bone in this \nrange is usually woven or repair bone. Woven bone is able to \nform faster but is less mineralized and less organized than \nlamellar bone. This may be the state for bone when an end-\nosteal implant is overloaded and the bone interface attempts \nto adapt to the greater strain environment. During the repair \nprocess, the woven bone is weaker than the more mature, \nmineralized lamellar bone.73 Although bone is loaded in the \nmild overload zone, care must be taken because the “safety \nrange” for bone strength is reduced during the repair.\nPathologic overload zones are reached when microstrains \nare greater than 3000 units.

A very soft bone, with incomplete mineralization \nand large intratrabecular spaces, may be addressed as D5 \nbone (Fig. 3.103).

The bone density \nmay be determined by the general location, tactile sense \nduring surgery, or computerized radiographic evaluation.\nComplications Related to Bone Density\nD1. Dense cortical bone also presents several disadvantages. \nThe implant height is often limited to less than 12 mm in the \natrophic mandible, and the crown height space is often \ngreater than 15 mm. As a result, additional force-multiplying \nand form ibrous tissue or, when present, repair woven bone \nis observed in this zone because a sustained turnover rate is \nnecessary. The marginal bone loss evidenced during implant \noverloading may be a result of the bone in the pathologic \noverload zone. Implant failure from overload may also be a \nresult of bone in the pathologic overload zone.\nUnderstanding Different Bone Densities\nIn 1988, Misch proposed four bone density groups indepen-\ndent of the regions of the jaws based on macroscopic cortical \nand trabecular bone characteristics.74 This bone density clas-\nsiication allows for different treatment protocols according \nto the type of bony anatomy. Suggested treatment plans, \nimplant design, surgical protocol, healing time, and progres-\nsive loading time spans have been described for each bone \ndensity type.17 Following this regimen, similar implant sur-\nvival rates have been observed for all bone densities.75\nDense or porous cortical bone is found on the outer sur-\nfaces of bone and includes the crest of an edentulous ridge. \nCoarse and ine trabecular bone types are found within the \nouter shell of cortical bone and occasionally on the crestal \nsurface of an edentulous residual ridge. These four macro-\nscopic structures of bone may be arranged from the most \ndense to the least dense, as irst described by Frost and by \nRoberts: dense cortical bone, porous cortical bone, coarse \ntrabecular bone, and ine trabecular bone (Fig. 3.98).\nIn combination, these four macroscopic densities consti-\ntute the four bone categories described by Misch (D1, D2, D3, \nand D4) located in the edentulous areas of the maxilla and \nmandible (Table 3.5; Fig. 3.99). The regional locations of the \ndifferent densities of cortical bone are more consistent than \nthe highly variable trabecular bone.\nD1 bone is primarily dense cortical bone.

The precise closure of the periosteum and the \noverlaying tissue has been shown to help recover the blood \nsupply and is encouraged (Box 3.18).\nD2. D2 bone provides excellent implant interface healing, \nand osteointegration is very predictable. There exist basically \nno disadvantages to this type of bone. Most implant systems \nrefer to this density of bone for their ideal surgical protocol. \nThe dense to porous cortical bone on the crest or lateral por-\ntions of the implant site provides a secure initial rigid inter-\nface. Osteoplasty to gain additional width of bone before \nimplant placement or countersinking below the crestal bone \ndoes not compromise support because the lateral cortices and \ncoarse internal trabecular bone provide rigid ixation. The \nimplant may even be placed slightly above the crest of the \nridge with decreased compromise or risk of movement at \nthe interface during healing, compared with softer bone \ntypes. The intrabony blood supply allows bleeding during the \nosteotomy, which helps control overheating during prepara-\ntion and is most beneicial for bone-implant interface healing \n(Figs. 3.105 and 3.106).\nD3. D3 bone also presents several disadvantages (Box 3.19). \nIt is more dificult to manage than the previous two bone \ndensity types (D1 and D2) because its preparation is com-\npleted easily. Bone preparation in D3 bone completed with \nconstant care of direction to avoid enlargement or elliptical \npreparation of the site.\nA common mistake that causes an elliptical site to form is \nthe use of a inger rest during the osteotomy. Because the drill \nis often longer than 20 mm, a inger rest results in an arched \npathway of the drill into the bone. In dense bone, the side of \nthe drill encroaches upon the dense cortical crest, which \nopposes the movement and stops the rotation before the \ncrestal osteotomy is enlarged. In D3 bone the arc pathway is \nnot stopped and the osteotomy at the level of the crestal \nFIG 3.104 D1 bone, when present, is almost always in the \nanterior mandibular area in the severely atrophic mandible. \nThis type of bone has a high BIC (~80%) and is susceptible \nto surgical complications (i.e., overheating the bone during \nosteotomy preparation). \nBOX 3.18 D1 Bone: Surgical \nModiications\n1.

On a scale \nof 1 to 10, D1 bone is a 9 to 10 relative to strength, D2 bone \nis a 7 to 8 on this scale, D3 bone is 50% weaker than D2 bone \nand is a 3 or 4 on the strength scale, and D4 bone is a 1 to 2 \nand up to 10 times weaker than D1 bone. It should be noted \nthat the studies of bone strength were performed on mature \nbone types. Bone is 60% mineralized at 4 months after \nimplant surgery, and the strength of bone is related to the \namount of mineralization. It is prudent to increase healing \ntime prior to loading in D3 and D4 bone densities. A period \nof 3 to 4 months is adequate for D1 and D2 bone. A healing \nperiod of 5 to 6 months is beneicial in D3 to D4 bone. The \nbone densities that originally relied on clinical impression are \nnow fully correlated to quantitative objective values obtained \nfrom CBCT scans and bone strength measurements. These \nvalues can help prevent failure in speciic situations of weak \ndensities.\nElastic Modulus and Density\nBy deinition, elastic modulus describes the amount of strain \n(changes in length divided by the original length) as a result \nFIG 3.109 The strength of bone is related directly to the \ndensity of bone.

This has been shown to be \ndirectly related to the apparent density of bone.78 The elastic \nmodulus of a material is a value that relates to the stiffness of \nthe material. The elastic modulus of bone is more lexible \nthan titanium. When higher stresses are applied to an implant \nprosthesis, the titanium has lower strain (change in shape) \ncompared with the bone. The difference between the two \nmaterials may create microstrain conditions of pathologic \noverload and cause implant failure. When the stresses applied \nto the implant are low, the microstrain difference between \ntitanium and bone is minimized and remains in the adapted \nwindow zone, maintaining load-bearing lamellar bone at the \ninterface.79\nMisch et al. found the elastic modulus of the trabecular \nbone in the human jaw to be different for each bone density \n(Fig. 3.111). As a result, when a stress is applied to an implant \nprosthesis in D1 bone, the titanium-D1 bone interface exhib-\nits very little microstrain difference. In comparison, when \nthe same amount of stress is applied to an implant in D4 \nbone, the microstrain difference between titanium and D4 \nbone is greater and may be in the pathologic overload zone \n(Fig. 3.112). As a result, D4 bone is more likely to cause \nimplant mobility and failure. Clinicians must take into con-\nsideration that poorer quality of bone is inherently more \nsusceptible to implant complications.\nBone-Implant Contact Percentage\nThe initial bone density not only provides mechanical immo-\nbilization of the implant during healing but after healing also \npermits distribution and transmission of stresses from the \nprosthesis to the implant-bone interface. The mechanical dis-\ntribution of stress occurs primarily where bone is in contact \nwith the implant. Open marrow spaces or zones of unorga-\nnized ibrous tissue do not permit controlled force dissipa-\ntion or microstrain conditions to the local bone cells. Because \nstress equals force divided by the area over which the force is \napplied, the less the area of bone contacting the implant \nbody, the greater the overall stress, other factors being equal. \nTherefore, the BIC percent has a signiicant inluence on the \namount of stress and strain at the interface."

As a result, many anterior mandibles with denser \nbone have less importance with respect to the implant \nnumber, size, or design compared with posterior maxillae \nwith less dense bone.\nStudies have shown the BIC is directly related to the bone \ndensity and the healing time. For example, in a study by Carr \net al.,80a the BIC was greater in the mandible than the maxilla \n(i.e., because of the greater bone density in the mandible in \ncomparison to the maxilla). In addition, the BIC was greater \nat 6 months compared with 3 months in both jaws \n(Fig. 3.115). Thus, the healing time before implant loading is \nrelated to the density of bone because the strength of bone \nincreases and the BIC increases with a longer time period. \nThree to 4 months of healing for D1 to D2 bone and 5 to 6 \nmonths for D3 to D4 bone has less risk than a shorter time \nperiod for all bone types.\nStress Transfer\nCrestal bone loss and early implant failure after loading \nresults may occur from excess stress at the implant-bone \ninterface. A range of bone loss has been observed in implants \nin different bone densities with similar load condition.81 \nBidez and Misch noted in 1990 that part of this phenomenon \nmay be explained by the evaluation of inite element analysis \n(FEA) stress contours in the different volumes of bone for \neach bone density.82 Each model reproduced the cortical and \ntrabecular bone material properties of the four densities \ndescribed. Clinical failure was mathematically predicted \nin D4 bone and some D3 densities under occlusal loads \n(Fig. 3.116). Other studies using FEA models with various \nimplant designs and bone quality have also evaluated the \nstress-strain distribution in the bone around the implants.83 \nFor example, Tada et al. evaluated the three-dimensional \nchanges around different length implants in different bone \nqualities (Fig. 3.117).84 The type 3 and 4 bone categories had \nfour to six times more strain around all implants, with the \nhighest strains around the shortest implants. As a result of \nthe correlation of bone density to the elastic modulus, bone \nstrength, and BIC percent, when a load is placed on an \nimplant, the stress contours in the bone are different for each \nbone density.85 In D1 bone, the highest strains are concen-\ntrated around the implant near the crest, and the stress in the \nregion is of lesser magnitude. D2 bone, with the same load, \nsustains a slightly greater crestal strain, and the intensity of \nthe stress extends farther apically along the implant body. D4 \nbone exhibits the greatest crestal strains, and the magnitude \nof the stress on the implant proceeds farthest apically along \nthe implant body.\nAs a consequence of different strain regions present around \nimplants with different bone densities, the magnitude of a \nprosthetic load may remain similar, and yet give one of the \nfollowing three different clinical situations at the bone-implant \ninterface based on the bone density around the implant: (1) \nphysiologic bone loads in the adapted window zone and no \nmarginal bone loss; (2) mild overload to pathologic overload \nbone loads and crestal bone loss; or (3) generalized pathologic \noverload and implant failure. To obtain a similar clinical result \nin each implant prosthesis, the variables in each patient must \nbe either eliminated or accounted for in the treatment plan. \nBecause the myriad of variables cannot be eliminated relative \nto bone density, the treatment plans (including implant \nnumber, size, and design) should be modiied.\nBone Density Treatment Planning\nThe irst component of the treatment planning process \nshould include the use of a radiographic evaluation, prefer-\nably a CBCT x-ray. Initially, an idea of the potential bone \ndensity can be determined by the anatomic position; anterior \nmandible and single tooth replacement is D2, anterior maxilla \nand posterior mandible is D3, and posterior maxilla is D4. \nSecondly, a more accurate representation of the bone density \nmay be determined by evaluation of the hounsield units \n(Hu) on a medical CT scan or a CBCT scan (i.e., linear cor-\nrelation with the corresponding hounsield units).

An implant prosthe-\nsis with normal patient forces in D4 bone should have at least \none implant per tooth. In the molar region, two implants for \neach missing molar may even be appropriate. In D3 bone, one \nimplant per tooth is often appropriate in the posterior region, \nwhere fewer implants are required in the anterior location. In \nD2 bone with normal patient forces, one or more pontic may \nreplace a tooth between two implants in both posterior and \nanterior regions.\nImplant Design. The surface area of the implant macroge-\nometry may be increased to decrease stress to the implant-\nbone interface. The easiest technique is to increase the implant \ndiameter, which will decrease stress by increasing the surface \narea. This may also reduce the length requirement. For \nexample, when a 0.5-mm increase in width occurs, there is \nan increased surface area between 10% and 15% for a cylin-\nder implant (i.e., even more difference is found with threaded \nimplant body designs). Because the greatest stresses are con-\ncentrated at the crestal region of the implant in favorable \nbone types, width is more signiicant than length for an \nimplant design after adequate length has been established. D4 \nbone should often require wider implants compared with D1 \nor D2 bone. This may require onlay grafts or bone spreading \nto increase the width of bone when other stress factors are \nhigh. Based on long-term clinical experience of V-shaped \nthreaded implant bodies, the minimum bone height for \ninitial ixation and early loading for D1 bone is 7 mm; for D2 \nbone, 9 mm; and for D3 bone, 12 mm using the classic \nV-thread screw implant design and titanium surface condi-\ntion. Because the crestal region is the location of pathologic \noverload of bone most often occurs after prosthetic loading, \nafter initial healing is complete, the length of the implant is \nnot as signiicant to solve crestal bone loss (i.e., and the \nquality of implant health) as other factors (e.g., implant \ndesign, implant width). In contrast, D4 bone beneits from \nrelatively longer implants for initial ixation and early loading \ncompared with other bone densities. This is not only for \ninitial ixation but also because the stress-strain transfer of \nocclusal forces extends farther down the implant body.\nImplant Coatings. Coatings or the surface condition on an \nimplant body can increase the BIC percentage and the func-\ntional surface area. A rougher surface is strongly suggested in \nsoft bone (e.g., D3, D4) and has resulted in improved survival \nrates compared with machined titanium. However, after 1 to 2 \nyears, the mechanical load on the overall implant design is more \ncritical to the amount and type of bone contact compared with \nthe surface condition on the implant body. Rough surface con-\nditions also may have some disadvantages. Plaque retention \nwhen exposed above the bone, contamination, and increased \ncost are a few of the concerns with roughened surfaces. The \nbeneit and risk of surface conditions suggests that the roughest \nsurfaces are most often used in only softer bone types.\nDirection of Force. The consequences of the direction and \namount of occlusal force is directly related to the bone density. \nA load directed along the long axis of the implant body \ndecreases the amount of stress in the crestal bone region \ncompared with an angled load (i.e., nonaxial load). As the \nbone density decreases, axial loads on the implant body \nbecome more critical as crestal bone loss may occur. Bone \ngrafting or bone spreading to increase the width of bone and \nto better position the implant relative to the intended load is \nconsidered for soft bone types. Additionally, adhering to pro-\ngressive bone loading in poorer bone qualities will decrease \nthe possibility of force-related bone loss.\nProgressive Bone Loading. Progressive bone loading pro-\nvides for a gradual increase in occlusal loads, separated by a \ntime interval to allow the bone to mature and accommodate \nto the local strain environment. If proper techniques are uti-\nlized, progressive bone loading changes the amount and \ndensity of the implant-bone contact (i.e., a D4 bone may be \nchanged to a D3 bone density). The increased density of bone \nat the implant interface improves the overall support system \nmechanism. The poorer quality of the bone, the more impor-\ntant the need for progressive loading.\nBone Density Summary\nA key determinant for clinical success is the diagnosis of the \nbone density in a potential implant site. The strength of bone \nhas been shown to be directly related to bone density. The \nmodulus of elasticity and the percentage of BIC is related to \nbone density. The occlusal force and direction of force with \nthe consequences are affected by the density of bone. As a \nconsequence, the clinician must take into consideration alter-\ning the protocol of treatment related to bone density to \ndecrease morbidity and increase survival rates. Studies and \nclinical experience has shown that altering the treatment plan \nto compensate for soft bone types has provided similar sur-\nvival rates in all bone densities. After the prosthetic option, \nkey implant position, and patient force factors have been \ndetermined, the bone density in the implant sites should be \nevaluated to modify the treatment plan. The treatment plan \nmay be modiied by reducing the force on the prosthesis or \nincreasing the area of load by increasing implant number, \nimplant size, implant design, or implant body surface condi-\ntion. Of these possibilities, the number of implants (i.e., \nadding additional implants) is often the most effective \nmethod to decrease the stress to the implant system.\nSIZE OF IMPLANTS\nNARROW-DIAMETER (MINI) IMPLANTS\nIn the 1970s, narrow-diameter implants smaller than 2 mm \nin diameter were very popular in Europe and South America. \nThese “pin” implants were often used in two or three sets for \neach tooth (Fig. 3.118). They did not maintain crestal bone, \noften would fail or fracture, and became unpopular after the \n3.75-mm-diameter root form implants were developed. More \nrecently, these implants have reemerged in the marketplace \n(Fig. 3.119)."

After the inal implant positions and numbers \nwere inserted in a two-stage healing process, additional mini-\nimplants were used to immediately restore and support a \ntransitional prosthesis. This approach still has validity when \npatients do not want to wear a removable restoration during \nthe initial healing process or to protect a bone graft site during \naugmentation. Although the transitional mini-implants may \nfail in some clinical situations, the regular-size implants are \nnot affected, and the inal restoration is not at risk.\nAfter a few years, the mini-implants were suggested for \nimplant overdenture support. The concept (as presented) \nplaces multiple mini-implants with O-ring or other overden-\nture attachment systems and immediately is used to retain \nand support the prosthesis (Fig. 3.120). It is also presented as \na “simple solution for denture comfort because of lapless \nimplant installation.” This concept also encourages a reduced \nfee to have greater patient acceptance.\nDisadvantages of “Mini” Implants\nCompared with implants 3.75 mm or larger, with thousands \nof clinical reports, the small-diameter implant has almost no \nlong-term studies. Even studies longer than 3 years are limited \nin numbers. Because implants smaller than 3 mm in diameter \nare usually too narrow for a two- or three-piece implant body \nabutment design, a one-piece implant is most often designed \n(Fig. 3.121). This requires the implant abutment portion to \nextend into the mouth upon insertion. Hence, the implant \nmost often is immediately placed into more function com-\npared with the one- or two-stage approach. This increases \nthe risk of failure during the healing period of bone because \nthe surgical healing and the early loading period occur at the \nsame time.\nAn implant has an increased risk of healing and early \nloading failure of 5% to 30% when used for an immediate \nrestoration, in part related to a number of factors, including \nthe implant diameter and design. The mini-implant is usually \nless than 2 mm in width. In a study by Misch, the small-\ndiameter implant (2.2–2.4 mm) had a 75.7% survival rate \nafter 6 weeks when used immediately for retention of a man-\ndibular denture using four to ive implants per patient.86\nTo decrease the risk of healing and early loading failure, a \nwider-diameter implant with an implant body with more \nsurface area is of beneit. Because the mini-implants are too \nnarrow to increase the depths of each thread, they act more \nas a “nail” than a screw. The surface area for initial ixation, \nearly loading, and mature loading is reduced.\nThe mini-implant designs are usually deicient in seven \nways: (1) decreased diameter and less surface area for loading; \n(2) a decreased thread depth; (3) less initial ixation; (4) \ngreater risk of fracture; (5) narrow range of prosthetic abut-\nment options; (6) dificult to splint implants together; and \n(7) immediate restoration often required (Box 3.23).\nThe “lapless” surgical approach is often suggested with \nthe mini-implant and has a perceived beneit of surgical \nease and less patient discomfort.

The \nroots of the natural dentition optimize the amount and direc-\ntion of forces found with the mouth. The smallest-diameter \nroots are located in the mandibular anterior region, where \nFIG 3.123 (A) The root surface area of the mandibular teeth \nis greater in the posterior regions, where the bite forces are \ngreater.

The \nmolars have multiple roots splinted together in one crown-\nmainly due to the amount of force received. The maxillary \nposterior region has the least bone density; the mandibular \ncounterpart has coarser trabecular bone. The maxillary \nmolars have more roots than the mandibular components \nand have more surface area to dissipate loads in the ine tra-\nbecular bone located in this region of the mouth. The molar \ncrowns are almost twice as large in diameter, and the root \nsurfaces are twice those of the premolars.

These guidelines are consistent for both teeth and \nimplants when engineering principles determine tooth and \nimplant size.\nSPLINTING IMPLANTS TO TEETH\nTREATMENT PLANNING\nTreatment planning a splinted implant-tooth prosthesis is \nvery controversial in implant dentistry today. The connection \nof a natural tooth (i.e., with a periodontal ligament) with a \ndental implant (i.e., direct bone interface) poses a biome-\nchanical challenge. To date, studies have been equivocal on \nthe success of this treatment mainly due to the differential \nsupport mechanisms.\nAlthough rare, the most common scenario for which a \nroot form implant may be joined to a natural tooth as a ter-\nminal abutment is in the posterior regions of the mouth. For \nexample, if a patient is missing the irst and second molars in \na quadrant (with no third molar present), the segment \nrequires at least two implants of proper size and design to \nindependently restore these two teeth. If adequate bone exists \nin the second molar and distal half of the irst molar but \ninadequate bone exists in the mesial half of the irst molar, a \npremolar-size pontic is required. The pontic may be cantile-\nvered from the anterior natural teeth or the posterior implants. \nEither of these options may result in complications because \nof tensile forces on the cement seal of the abutment farthest \nfrom the pontic.\nAn alternative may be to join the implant to a natural \ntooth, if all other factors are favorable. This plan is more likely \nin the presence of a Division C−h ridge in the pontic region, \nwhen inadequate bone height adjacent to the natural tooth \ndecreases the prognosis of a vertical bone graft. Another sce-\nnario in favor of this treatment plan is when the posterior \nimplants are of a narrower diameter than usual. When two \nDivision B root forms are used in the posterior mandible to \nreplace molars, there should be no cantilever to magnify the \nforce on the implants. Posterior pontics should not be canti-\nlevered from even two splinted Division B root form implants. \nAn additional root form implant or natural tooth is required \nas an abutment for the ixed prosthesis. When an additional \nimplant insertion is not an option, the posterior implants \nmay be joined by a rigid connector (i.e., a solder joint) to \nnatural teeth within the prosthesis, provided all dental factors \nare favorable (Fig. 3.124).\nThe connection of natural teeth and osteointegrated \nimplants within a single rigid prosthesis has generated \nconcern and publications, with studies and guidelines for \nboth extremes (Fig. 3.125). In other words, some articles \nreport problems, whereas others state that no problem exists. \nTo be more speciic to a particular situation, more informa-\ntion is required to design a successful treatment plan. Two \ndesigns are available for the connection of implants and teeth \nwithin the same prosthesis: a conventional ixed partial \ndenture or a ixed partial denture with a nonrigid connector. \nimplants in both arches. When larger-diameter implants \ncannot be used in the molar region, two 4-mm-diameter \nimplants for each molar should be considered, especially in \nthe maxilla (Box 3.24).\nThe ideal size of the implant body should be incorporated \ninto a treatment plan rather than the surgeon determining \nthis dimension at the time of surgery. The initial size of an \nimplant is determined in both length and diameter. In a two-\nstage healing protocol the ideal implant length should be at \nleast 12 mm. The poorer quality of the bone, the longer the \nimplant requirements. The greater the bite force, the longer \nthe implant dimension. Therefore, the shortest implant \nlength may be treatment planned in the anterior mandible, \nthe anterior maxilla may have a slightly longer implant, the \nposterior mandible may have a longer implant, and the \nlongest implant requirement for an ideal treatment plan is \nusually found in the posterior maxilla.\nThe diameter of an implant has surgical, loading, and \nprosthetic considerations. In the initial treatment plan, the \nloading and prosthetic components are most important. The \nwidth of the implant is directly related to the overall func-\ntional surface area. Where the forces are greater or the bone \nis less dense, the implant is wider, ranging from 3 to 6 mm. \nAs a general rule, the narrowest implant is found in the ante-\nrior mandible followed by the anterior maxilla and the pos-\nterior mandible; the widest-diameter requirements are found \nin the molar region of the posterior maxilla.\nThe prosthetic aspects of the implant width are primar-\nily related to the esthetics of the emergence proile, the \nforce on an abutment screw, and the strength of the \nimplant components. As a result, wider-diameter implants \nare selected in the molar regions; standard diameters in the \ncanines, premolars, and maxillary central incisors; and the \nsmallest-size implants in the maxillary lateral and mandib-\nular incisors.\nThe natural dentition follows the guidelines established in \nthe implant-size treatment plan considerations. The correla-\ntion is most likely found because of the biomechanical rela-\ntionship of the amount and type of the forces in the location \nof the jaws and the type of the bone in the region. In the \nmaxilla, ine trabecular bone is used to dissipate forces, and \nthe amount of force is the greatest in the molar region.

With natural teeth, horizontal tooth \nmobility is greater than vertical movement. A very light force \n(500 g) moves the tooth horizontally 56 to 108 mm (Fig. \n3.127). The initial horizontal mobility of a healthy, nonmo-\nbile posterior tooth is less than that of an anterior tooth and \nranges from 56 to 75 mm, which is two to nine times the \nvertical movement of the tooth.

The mobility of implants varies in \ndirect proportion to the load applied and the bone density \nand relects the elastic deformation of bone tissue.\nAn interesting note in implant mobility is that no signii-\ncant difference was related to implant length. This inding \nfurther conirms that implant length is not the primary factor \nfor implant support, even in the presence of lateral loads. \nBone density affects this condition more than implant length. \nThese mobility characteristics corroborate the indings of \nFenton et al., who applied a 500-g load for 4 seconds to \nmaxillary anterior teeth and osseointegrated implants. The \nimplants were displaced a mean 10 mm with a rapid elastic \nreturn (less than 1 millisecond), whereas the teeth showed a \nmean displacement of 57 mm with a prolonged viscoelastic \nreturn.91 When all factors are considered, an implant moves \nvertically and horizontally, the abutments and prosthesis lex, \nand the tooth has apical and lateral movements.\nGuidelines for Joining Implants to Teeth\nA vertical movement/force placed on a posterior implant joined \nto a healthy posterior tooth causes mesial tension on the \nimplant. The implant can move vertically 3 mm and mesially \n40 to 115 mm, and a noble metal-ixed prosthesis with one \npontic allows mesiodistal movement of 6 mm. A natural tooth \nwith no clinical mobility could be connected rigidly to an osseo-\nintegrated implant because the implant, bone, and prosthesis \ncompensate for the slight tooth movement. There is extensive \ndocumentation that implants can be connected rigidly to stable \nteeth. However, the occlusion should be modiied to allow the \ninitial occlusal contacts on the natural tooth so that the implant \ndoes not bear the major portion of the initial load.\nNo Mobility of Natural Tooth Abutment. The mobility of \nhealthy anterior incisor teeth often is recorded as 1 with a \nrange of movement from 90 to 108 mm. Visual clinical evalu-\nation by the human eye can detect movement greater than \n90 mm. When the mobility of a natural tooth can be observed, \nmobility is greater than 90 mm and too great to be compen-\nsated by the implant, bone, and prosthesis movement. When \nthe vertical posterior tooth movement, vertical implant \nmovement, mesiodistal implant movement, and prosthesis \nmovement are compared with the same conditions of an \nanterior tooth with lateral loads, the biomechanical risk \nfactors do not correlate. One primary condition for joining \nan implant to natural teeth is the lack of observable clinical \nmovement of the natural abutment.\nNo Lateral Forces on Prosthesis. Another requisite to join \nan implant to a natural tooth is that no lateral force should \nbe designed on the prosthesis. Lateral forces increase the \nFIG 3.128 Clinical image of tooth-implant showing failure \nbecause of recurrent decay. \namount of tooth movement and decrease the amount of \nimplant movement (faciolingual vs. mesiodistal). Horizontal \nforces placed on an implant also magnify the amount of stress \nat the crestal bone region. Implants should rarely be con-\nnected to anterior teeth because (1) anterior teeth often \nexhibit greater clinical mobility than the implant can tolerate \nand (2) the lateral forces applied to the restoration during \nmandibular excursions are transmitted to the natural tooth \nand implant abutments (Fig. 3.128).\nAdditional Treatment Options. When the natural abutment \nexhibits clinical horizontal movement or conditions promote \nhorizontal forces against the abutment tooth, two options can \nbe selected for the inal prosthesis. The irst, and the option \nof choice, is to place additional implants and to avoid the \ninclusion of natural abutments in the inal prosthesis. The \nother option is to improve stress distribution by splinting \nadditional natural abutments until no clinical mobility is \nobserved.\nGuidelines for Splinting Dental Units\nSplinting natural teeth does not decrease the mobility of a \ntooth signiicantly after the prosthesis is removed; however, \nthe overall prosthesis movement is decreased, especially when \nthe splinted units form an arch. If posterior contacts cannot \nbe eliminated in lateral excursions as a result of skeletal rela-\ntionships or when opposing a removable prosthesis, splinting \noften is safer to reduce the risk of long-term complications. \nIn addition, splinting natural abutments also decreases the \namount of load to each abutment (when a 150-psi load is \ndistributed to all splinted abutments, the resultant force on \neach abutment is decreased) (Fig. 3.129).\nThe number of teeth to splint together is the number \nrequired to eliminate prosthesis movement. The initial dental \nevaluation may include acid etching and bonding potential \nmobile natural abutments to each other to determine how \nmany teeth must be joined to reduce the prosthesis clinical"

The \nweak tooth does not offer additional support and further \nburdens the healthier abutments. In addition, if cement \nfailure occurs or the restoration needs retrieval, the partially \nretained prosthesis is more dificult to retrieve from the \nmobile abutment, resulting in more frequent coronal fracture \nand other complications.\nThe natural teeth exhibit some faciolingual movement, \nwhich varies from 56 to 108 µm in health. The discussion \nhere is to reduce tooth movement when it is visible so that \nthe mobile teeth may be connected to the implants. Although \nthe teeth move in a faciolingual direction, different regions \nof the arch have different directions of movement relative to \neach other. In other words, the faciolingual direction of the \nanterior teeth corresponds to the mesiodistal direction of the \nposterior teeth, and if these dental units are splinted to each \nother, the splint may become nonmobile.\nA dental arch may be described as a ive-sided structure. \nThe posterior teeth on one side move in a similar direction \nto each other, the canine moves in a different direction, the \nanterior teeth move in a third direction, the contralateral \ncanine moves in yet another direction in comparison, and the \nother posterior component of the arch moves in a similar \ndirection as the irst. The more dental sections are connected, \nthe more rigid the structure. As a general rule, three or more \nsections rigidly connected create an overall nonmobile dental \nstructure. Even mild to moderate individual mobile dental \nunits may become a nonmobile single unit.\nThe approach of joining implants to mobile teeth in \nseveral different arch positions is usually limited to condi-\ntions when the multiple sections of the dental arch already \nrequire restoration. Rarely would one consider crowning \neight or more teeth solely to splint to the implant component. \nInstead, the use of a natural tooth pier abutment may be \nindicated.\nThe last tooth in a splinted prosthesis should not have \npoor retentive form. When a force is applied to the terminal \nregion of a multiple-splinted restoration, the pier abutments \nmay act as a fulcrum. As a consequence, tensile and shear \nforces may be applied to the cement seal. Because the cements \nare 20 times weaker in shear compared with compressive \nforces, the cement seal may break. As a consequence, the \nnatural abutment often decays and may be lost. The most \ndistal tooth in a splinted restoration should have adequate \nheight and retentive form.\nThe adjacent teeth should be able to have the path of inser-\ntion as all the dental units in the prosthesis. It may be neces-\nsary to perform endodontics or even extract an offending \ntooth to accomplish the goal of splinting across an arch.\nThe adjacent teeth that are splinted together should not \nbe overlapped or crowded. It may be necessary to have ortho-\ndontics or selective extractions to prepare the teeth for a \nsimilar path of insertion as the implant prosthesis. When the \nadjacent teeth are splinted, enough interproximal tooth \ntissues must be removed to permit adjacent metal crowns, \nconnectors, and porcelain to be applied and maintain inter-\nproximal hygiene.\nFIG 3.129 (A) Splinting natural teeth together decreases their \nmobility and reduces the amount of stress transferred to the \nsupport system.

In other words, to decrease mobility, at least \nthe last tooth in the splint (and sometimes more) should \nbe rigid.\n2. The terminal abutments in the splint should not have poor \nretention form.\n3. Adjacent teeth splinted together should be parallel enough \nto have the same path of insertion for the prosthesis.\n4. Adjacent teeth should not be crowded or overlapped and \nshould have enough room for splinted crowns to have \nadequate interproximal hygiene.\nA classic axiom for splinting teeth in prosthodontics reads, \n“It is unadvisable to employ the last tooth as a splinted abut-\nment if it lacks a degree of irmness comparable to its healthy \nneighbor because the strain on the irm abutment could be \ndestructive.”92 Implant prostheses may use additional second-\nary natural abutments to decrease the movement of the pros-\nthesis so that rigid ixation of the implant will not be \ncompromised.

When the natural \ntooth or teeth have clinical mobility, the force is lateral on the \nprosthesis, or the forces are greater than usual. A pier implant \nabutment may cause complications even when joined to non-\nmobile teeth as terminal abutments (Fig. 3.132).\nUncemented restorations are a common complication in \nFPDs even when all aspects of treatment are within accept-\nable limits. Any condition that may increase this problem, \nsuch as the one presently addressed, should be carefully \navoided.\nPATIENT TREATMENT PLANNING\nFAILURE TO PROVIDE TO THE PATIENT \nCOMPREHENSIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS\nWhen discussing a treatment plan with a patient, it is quite \neasy to get mentally focused on a certain treatment option \nbased on the actual needs and perceived values of the patient. \nImplant clinicians sometimes favor certain treatments (e.g., \nIn conclusion, the natural abutment connected to a rigidly \nixated implant should not exhibit clinical mobility or poor \nretentive form. These same two criteria should be considered \nfor the natural tooth used as a secondary abutment when \nsplinting teeth in a FPD.\nNonrigid Connectors. Although nonrigid connectors have \nbeen advocated in the literature,93 a nonrigid connector in a \nunilateral prosthesis rarely is indicated for implant-ixed \nprostheses and may be detrimental. Nonrigid connection \ndoes not improve the stress distribution between the different \nabutments94 and has been reported to have caused migration \nof the natural teeth.95 If the nonrigid connector exhibits any \nclinically observed mobility, it moves more than the implant. \nAs such, the implant-supported part of the restoration is \ncantilevered to the attachment. In addition, the nonrigid (or \nmobile) attachment adds cost, creates overcontoured abut-\nments, impairs daily hygiene, and does not decrease the clini-\ncal tooth movement.\nIntrusion. Reports of intrusion of the natural tooth con-\nnected to an implant usually include the use of temporary \ncement to lute a coping to the natural abutment, leaving the \ninal restoration uncemented on the coping, or the use of a \nnonrigid connector.96 When implants are joined to teeth that \nact as a terminal abutment, a deinitive cement should be \nused for the natural tooth. The tooth cannot intrude unless \nit becomes unretained from the abutment (or has a nonrigid \nconnector between the units).\nA possible explanation for tooth intrusion may be that the \ntooth is pushed vertically 28 µm but wants to rebound only \n8 µm. The ixed prosthesis rebounds immediately and pulls \non the tooth. The cement seal eventually breaks, causing a \nspace to develop, which is irst occupied by air. The prosthesis \nthen acts as an orthodontic appliance and continually pushes \nthe tooth in a vertical direction. Eventually, the space is occu-\npied by saliva, and hydraulics continue the downward force \nduring mastication. The tooth eventually submerges or \nintrudes from the prosthesis (Fig. 3.130).\nImplant Pier (Intermediary) Abutments\nA pier abutment is one between two other abutments, some-\ntimes referred to as an intermediate abutment. The interme-\ndiate abutment may be an implant or a natural tooth, and \neach type plays a different role in the overall treatment. \nWhen an implant serves as a pier abutment between two \nnatural teeth, the difference in movement between implant \nand tooth may increase the complication rate compared with \none intermediate tooth joined to two terminal implants \n(Fig. 3.131). The pier implant abutment exhibits less move-\nment than the natural teeth terminal abutments and acts as \nthe fulcrum of a class I lever. As a consequence, a compressive \nforce on one end of the prosthesis is converted to a tensile or \nshear force on the other terminal abutment. The cement \ntensile strength is often 20 or more times less than the com-\npressive strength. When the implant acts as a fulcrum, an \nuncemented abutment (usually the least mobile tooth or least \nFIG 3.130 Splinting implants via intracoronal attachment \n(A, B).

Proposing this treatment option \nmay seem counterintuitive to clinicians because the goal of \ndentistry is to restore a patient to optimal function. However, \nthe presentation of this option does allow the clinician to \nenter into a discussion as to the various consequences of \ntooth loss, bone loss, and lack of masticatory eficiency.\nAdvantages. The only advantages of no treatment are the \npatient will not have to undergo further procedures to address \nthe situation, and secondly, there will be no inancial demands \nfor the patient.\nDisadvantages\nMovement of adjacent teeth. When a patient loses a \nsingle tooth, there are numerous consequences that may \nresult to create an occlusal disharmony and the potential for \nfurther dental complications. If a tooth is extracted in any \nposition anterior to the second molars, the patient can expect \nfor the tooth distal to it to begin tilting mesially into the \nvacant space. This will most likely result in a change of the \nocclusal plane on that side. As the teeth experience this mesial \ntilt, the direction of load changes, which may cause excessive \nstress to the periodontal ligament. The contacting teeth in the \nopposing arch will begin to supraerupt in relation to the \nchanges in the occlusal plane. The correction of future supra-\nerupted teeth may require orthodontic or endodontic/crown \ntherapy. In some situations, extraction may be necessary.\nOcclusal force issues. Another consequence of the single \nmissing tooth is the patient will typically favor the fully \ndentate side to chew with, due to a decreased masticatory \neficiency on the partially edentulous side. This situation \nresults in the overuse of the fully dentate side, leading to \nfatigue-related issues with the teeth. Examples of these issues \nwould be porcelain fracture of crowns, fractures of enamel/\nillings, signiicant occlusal wear, or myofascial pain compli-\ncations (Box 3.25).\nFIG 3.131 A pier implant abutment between two natural \nteeth may cause a cement seal to break on the teeth, espe-\ncially if one is more mobile than the other.

    "content": "135\nCHAPTER 3 Treatment Planning Complications\nFixed Partial Denture\nAdvantages\nCommon type of treatment. A ixed prosthesis is a conven-\ntional and common type of procedure that most clinicians \nare comfortable performing. The prosthesis can be fabricated \nrather quickly because a laboratory can generate a complete \nrestoration in 1 to 2 weeks that satisies the criteria of normal \ncontour, comfort, function, esthetics, speech, and health. \nMost patients have an increased compliance with this type \nof treatment, especially because no surgical intervention \nis needed.\nMinimal need for soft and hard tissue augmentation. With \na ixed partial denture, augmentation of the edentulous area \nis very uncommon. Because the pontic may be modiied to \nencompass most defects, surgical augmentation procedures \nare usually not indicated. In some instances, lack of attached \ntissue will be present on abutment teeth; however, this is \nrather rare.\nDisadvantages\nIncreased caries rate. Despite the many advantages that \nan FPD has over its removable counterpart, the treatment \nmodality does have inherent disadvantages. Caries and end-\nodontic failure of the abutment teeth are the most common \ncauses of ixed partial denture prosthesis failure.100 Caries \noccur more than 20% of the time and endodontic complica-\ntions to the abutments of a FPD 15% of the time. Recurrent \ndecay on the abutment crown primarily occurs on the margin \nnext to the pontic. Fewer than 10% of patients loss on a \nregular basis, and those using a loss threader are even fewer.101 \nAs a result, the pontic acts as a large overhang next to the \ncrown and a reservoir for plaque and bacteria. The long- \nterm periodontal health of the abutment teeth may also \nbe at greater risk as a result of the plaque increase, including \nbone loss.\nIncreased endodontic treatment. When a vital tooth is \nprepared for a crown, a 3% to 6% risk of irreversible pulpal \ninjury and subsequent need for endodontic treatment \nexists.102 Not only does tooth preparation present a risk for \nRemovable Partial Denture\nAdvantages. The main advantages of the removable partial \ndenture (RPD) in restoring a single missing tooth are based \non convenience. The patient can receive a tooth-borne RPD \nafter a few appointments, and there is a lack of invasive treat-\nment in this modality. There is also a lower associated cost in \ncomparison to most other treatment options.\nDisadvantages\nDecreased acceptance. Removable partial dentures, \neven those that are primarily tooth borne, have a low patient \nacceptance rate compared to other treatment options. Patients \nexperience dificulty in eating, as food debris may become \ntrapped under the prosthesis. Speech patterns are often dis-\nrupted, as the patient must acclimate to the partial framework \nin the mouth. The prosthesis is often bulky, covering part of \nthe palatal tissue on the maxilla or the lingual tissue on the \nmandible.\nIncreased morbidity to abutment teeth. Reports of remov-\nable partial dentures indicate the health of the remaining \ndentition and surrounding oral tissues often deteriorates. In \na study that evaluated the need for repair of an abutment \ntooth as the indicator of failure, the “success” rates of conven-\ntional removable partial dentures were 40% at 5 years and \n20% at 10 years.97 Patients wearing the partial dentures often \nexhibit greater mobility of the abutment teeth, greater plaque \nretention, increased bleeding upon probing, higher incidence \nof caries, speech inhibition, taste inhibition, and noncompli-\nance of use. A report by Shugars et al. found abutment tooth \nloss for a removable partial denture may be as high as 23% \nwithin 5 years and 38% within 8 years.98\nIncreased bone loss. The natural abutment teeth, on \nwhich direct and indirect retainers are designed, must submit \nto additional lateral forces. Because these teeth are often com-\npromised by deicient periodontal support, many partial den-\ntures are designed to minimize the forces applied to them. The \nresult is an increase in mobility of the removable prosthesis \nand greater soft tissue support. These conditions protect the \nremaining teeth but accelerate the bone loss in the edentulous \nregions.99 It should be noted that bone loss is accelerated in the \nsoft tissue support regions in patients wearing the removable \nprosthesis compared with no prosthesis (Box 3.26).\nBOX 3.25 Missing Single Tooth: \nNo Treatment Option\nAdvantages\n• No treatment time for the patient\n• No inancial outlay for the patient\nDisadvantages\n• Supraeruption of the opposing teeth\n• Drifting/tilting movement of the adjacent teeth\n• Decrease masticatory function\n• Food impaction\n• Adjacent teeth will receive a higher occlusal load\n• Occlusal overuse of contralateral side\nBOX 3.26 Missing Single Tooth: \nRemovable Partial Denture  \nTreatment Option\nAdvantages\n• Minimal treatment minimal cost compared to other options\nDisadvantages\n• Poorly tolerated\n• Decreased survival rate\n• Increased mobility\n• Plaque accumulation\n• Bleeding on probing caries on abutment teeth\n• Increased need for abutment teeth loss or repair\n• Food impaction\n• Accelerated bone loss in edentulous area"

Studies have shown up \nto 15% of abutment teeth for a ixed restoration require end-\nodontic therapy compared with 3% to 6% of nonabutment \nteeth with crown preparations.103\nUnfavorable outcomes of FPD failure. There exist many \nissues that may result when a ixed partial denture fails. These \nmay include not only the need to replace the failed prosthesis \nbut also the loss of an abutment tooth and the need for addi-\ntional pontics and abutment teeth in the replacement bridge. \nBecause 15% of FPD abutment teeth require endodontics, \nmany abutment teeth may be lost. In addition, an endodontic \nposterior tooth abutment is at a greater risk of fracture. \nReports indicate that abutment teeth for a FPD fail from \nendodontic complications (e.g., fracture) four times more \noften than those with vital pulps.104 The fracture of the tooth \nmay result in failure of the prosthesis and abutment tooth.\nThe abutment teeth of an FPD may be lost from caries, \nendodontic complications, or root fracture at rates up to 30% \nfor 8 to 14 years.105 Recent reports indicate 8% to 18% of the \nabutment teeth supporting a FPD are lost within 10 years. \nThis is most disturbing because 80% of abutments have no \nprevious decay or are minimally restored before the fabrica-\ntion of the FPD (Box 3.27).106\nBOX 3.27 Missing Single Tooth: Fixed \nPartial Denture Treatment Option\nAdvantages\n• Most common treatment (doctor friendly)\n• Reduced time (two appointments, 1 to 2 weeks apart)\n• Restores function, esthetics, and intraarch health\n• Few bone and soft tissue considerations\n• Proven long-term survival\n• Reduced cost—dental insurance covers procedure (reduced \npatient cost)\n• Indicated when minimal mesiodistal space (<6 mm space)\n• Potential abutments have clinical mobility; will beneit from \nbeing splinted\n• Increases patient compliance and reduces fear\nDisadvantages\n• Mean life span approximates 10 to 15 years\n• Caries and endodontic failure of abutment teeth most \ncommon complication\n• Increased plaque retention of pontic increases caries and \nperiodontal disease risk\n• Hygiene dificulty\n• Damage to healthy teeth (removing undamaged tooth \nstructure)\n• Failure of prosthesis related to loss of abutment teeth (8% \nto 18% within 10 years)\n• Fracture complications (porcelain, tooth)\n• Esthetic complications (crowns less esthetic than natural \nteeth)\n• Uncemented restoration\nBOX 3.28 Missing Single Tooth: Dental \nImplant Treatment Option\nAdvantages\n• Adjacent teeth do not require splinted restorations\n• Less risk of caries\n• Less risk of endodontics\n• Less risk of porcelain fracture\n• Less risk of uncemented restoration\n• Less fracture of tooth\n• Psychologic need of patient addressed: patient does not \ndesire two adjacent teeth (often virgin) prepared and \nsplinted to restore missing tooth\n• Improved hygiene conditions\n• Less decay risk\n• Floss vs. loss threader\n• Less pontic “plaque trap overhang”\n• Decreased cold or contact sensitivity\n• Prepared teeth more temperature sensitive\n• Cementum of tooth removed by tooth preparation; tooth-\nbrush or scaler sensitive\n• Maintains bone in site: 30% decreasing bone width within \n3 years after extraction\n• Decreases adjacent tooth loss: 30% vs. 0.05% risk at \n10 years\nDisadvantages\n• Increased treatment time\n• Need for surgical treatment\n• May need hard and soft tissue augmentation\n• Possibly less esthetic\n• Retained cement\n• Peri-implantitis\n• Increased laboratory fees\nSingle Tooth Implant (Box 3.28)\nAdvantages\nHigher success rate. The single tooth implant provides \nnumerous advantages when compared to the other treatment \noptions. Most studies to date have shown a single tooth implant \nto be the most predictable method of single tooth replacement. \nMost long-term studies report success rates exceeding 90%.\nHygiene. The dental implant treatment plan will usually \nallow for easier hygiene access because the proximal surfaces \ncan be reached for lossing. This acts as a preventive measure \nagainst peri-implatntitis issues.\nNo alteration of adjacent teeth. Adjacent teeth do not \nhave to be altered with the implant option, which decreases \nthe risk of recurrent caries or endodontic possibilities with \nthese teeth. Because of these advantages the patient is at a \nmuch lower risk of losing further teeth in the future.\nBetter cost comparison. Cost comparison studies con-\nclude that the implant restoration demonstrates a more \nfavorable cost-effectiveness ratio.30 Even when the adjacent \nteeth are not lost, the conventional FPD often needs to be \nreplaced more frequently because of decay, endodontic com-\nplications, porcelain fracture, or unretained restoration (i.e.,"

With a ixed partial denture \nreplacing a single missing tooth, continued bone resorption \nwill occur. Therefore, placing an implant into the edentulous \nsite will help maintain the existing host bone. Additionally, this \nwill decrease the possibility of soft tissue recession.\nDisadvantages\nIncreased treatment time. The single tooth implant pro-\ncedure will take a considerably longer time for treatment in \ncomparison to a RPD or FPD. From the initial surgical place-\nment, the average implant will require an average of 4 to 6 \nmonths for osseointegration to occur. This time frame is \ndependent on the patient’s bone density in that area as well \nas the volume of bone that was present at placement. In an \neffort to address this issue, techniques have been proposed to \nimmediately place and at times immediately provisionalize \nimplants. However, in certain circumstances, these techniques \npresent disadvantages, especially when the patient criteria for \nthese procedures is not met.\nNeed for additional treatment. In esthetic areas, modii-\ncations to the soft tissue may be necessary as well in an effort \nto change the soft tissue drape or to enhance the patient’s \ntissue biotype. This usually will lead to more complex proce-\ndures that are needed for tissue augmentation. In addition, \nbone augmentation procedures may be indicated to increase \nbone volume for implant placement. In some cases, this may \nincrease the cost signiicantly as well as the treatment time.\nEsthetics. Based on available bone and crown height space, \nthe inal prosthesis may feature a traditional tooth contour \n(FP1), a longer crown form (FP2), or may require the addition \nof pink porcelain to mimic normal soft tissue contours (FP3). \nThe patient must be aware of these possibilities as their esthetic \ndemands may contraindicate implant placement or will dictate \ndictate the need for adjunctive bone grafting procedures.\nMultiple Missing Teeth\nNo Treatment. The patient should always be given an explana-\ntion of the possible ramiications that may occur if no treat-\nment is rendered. No treatment is more of a concern in \ncomparison to a single edentulous site as esthetic issues, decrease \nin masticatory eficiency, and food impaction issues may arise.\nAdvantages. When a patient is missing multiple teeth, the \neducation and communication to the patient is even more \nimportant. Although there is no inancial or time commit-\nment for the patient, the disadvantages are more signiicant \nin comparison to a single missing tooth.\nDisadvantages\nDecreased masticatory function. The main disadvantage \nof not replacing multiple missing teeth is the decreased mas-\nticatory function. Patients will place more force and stress on \ntheir remaining teeth, which leads to increased morbidity. \nThe forces of mastication are transmitted to the remaining \nteeth, which results in a greater possibility of decay, mobility, \nperiodontal issues, and loss of teeth. The longer the edentu-\nlous ridge remains without stimulation, the greater chance \nbone loss will occur. This may lead to the future need for hard \nand soft tissue augmentation procedures to increase hard and \nsoft tissue volume for implant placement.\nTooth movement. The remaining teeth may continue to \nshift in relation to the stresses of mastication, causing move-\nment and tilting. Teeth in the opposing arch will supraerupt \ndue to the lack of stimulation by an opposing tooth, causing \nroot exposure and occlusal disharmony. These phenomena \ncombine to potentially complicate or contraindicate future \nimplant placement.\nEsthetics. If no treatment is rendered for the edentulous \narea, obvious esthetic issues will result. In most cases, patient \nacceptance of the edentulous areas is low, and esthetics is \nusually a motivating factor in seeking rehabilitation.\nRemovable Partial Denture\nSee the advantages and disadvantages for RPD in Box 3.26.\nImplanted-Supported Crowns\nSee the advantages and disadvantages for RPD in Box 3.28.\nCompletely Edentulous\nNo Treatment. The patient should always be given an expla-\nnation of the possible ramiications that may occur if no \ntreatment is rendered.\nAdvantages. There exist few advantages other than no \ntreatment time or inancial outlay for the patient.\nDisadvantages\nContinued bone loss. Most clinicians overlook the insidi-\nous bone loss that will occur after tooth extraction. The patient \nis often not educated about the anatomic changes and the \npotential consequences of continued bone loss. The bone loss \naccelerates when the patient wears a poorly itting soft tissue–\nborne prosthesis. Most patients do not understand that bone \nresorption occurs over time and at a greater rate beneath \npoorly itting dentures. Patients do not return for regular visits \nfor evaluation of their condition; instead, they return after \nseveral years when denture teeth are worn down or can no \nlonger be tolerated. In fact, studies have shown that the average \ndenture wearer sees a dentist every 14.8 years after having a \ncomplete denture. The traditional method of tooth replace-\nment (dentures) often affects bone loss in a manner not suf-\niciently considered by the clinician and the patient. The \nclinician should inform the patient that a denture replaces \nmore bone and soft tissue than teeth, and every 3 to 5 years a \nreline, or new denture is suggested to replace the additional \nbone loss by atrophy that will occur (Fig. 3.133 and Box 3.29).\nSoft tissue consequences. As bone loses width, then \nheight, then width and height again, the attached gingiva \ngradually decreases. A very thin attached tissue usually lies \nover the advanced atrophic mandible or is entirely absent. \nThe increasing zones of mobile, unkeratinized gingiva are \nprone to abrasions caused by the overlying prosthesis, which \nwill lead to bone loss. In addition, unfavorable high muscle \nattachments and hypermobile tissue often complicate the \nsituation. The continued atrophy of the posterior mandible \neventually causes prominent mylohyoid and internal oblique"

Conditions such as the \npatient’s age, hypertension, diabetes, anemia, and nutritional \ndisorders have deleterious effects on the vascular supply and \nsoft tissue quality under removable prostheses. These disor-\nders result in a decreased oxygen tension to the basal cells of \nthe epithelium. Surface cell loss occurs at the same rate, but \nthe cell formation at the basal layer is slowed. As a result, \nthickness of the surface tissues gradually decreases, and sore \nspots and uncomfortable removable prostheses result. The \ntongue of a patient with edentulous ridges often enlarges to \naccommodate the increase in space formerly occupied by \nteeth. At the same time, it is used to limit the movements of \nthe removable prostheses and takes a more active role in the \nmastication process. As a result, the removable prosthesis \ndecreases in stability. The decrease in neuromuscular control, \noften associated with aging, further compounds the problems \nof traditional removable prosthodontics. The ability to wear \na denture successfully may be largely a learned, skilled per-\nformance. An aged patient who recently became edentulous \nmay lack the motor skills needed to adjust to the new condi-\ntions (Box 3.30).\nEsthetic consequences. The facial changes that naturally \noccur in relation to the aging process can be accelerated and \npotentiated by the loss of teeth (Fig. 3.134). There exist many \nesthetic consequences that result from the loss of alveolar \nbone. A decrease in facial height from a collapsed vertical \ndimension will causes several facial changes (Fig. 3.135). The \nloss of the labiomental angle and deepening of vertical lines \nin the area create a harsh appearance. As the vertical dimen-\nsion progressively decreases, the occlusion evolves toward a \npseudo class III malocclusion. As a result, the chin \nrotates forward and creates a prognathic facial appearance \n(Fig. 3.136). These conditions result in a decrease in the hori-\nzontal labial angle at the corner of the lips; the patient appears \nunhappy when the mouth is at rest (Fig. 3.137). People with \nshort facial types have higher bite forces, greater bone loss, \nridges covered by thin, movable, unattached mucosa. The \nanterior residual alveolar process also continues to resorb, \nand the superior genial tubercles (which are 20 mm below \nthe crest of bone when teeth are present) eventually become \nthe most superior aspect of the anterior mandibular ridge. \nThere is little to prevent the prosthesis from moving forward \nagainst the lower lip during function or speech.

Patients are \nusually unaware the hard and soft tissue changes are from the \nloss of teeth. Among denture wearers, studies have shown that \n39% have been wearing the same prosthesis for more than 10 \nyears.87 The profession is unable to evaluate patients unless \nthey return yearly. It is important that the consequences of \ntooth loss be explained to partially or completely edentulous \npatients during the early phases of treatment.\nComplete Upper Denture\nAdvantages. Compared to no treatment, the complete \nupper denture will usually satisfy esthetic and some func-\ntional requirements. The patient will have landmarks to use \nfor pronunciation of words, and they will retain the appear-\nance of facial height, although supericially.\nDisadvantages\nMasticatory function. The difference in maximum occlu-\nsal forces recorded in a person with natural teeth and one \nwho is completely edentulous is dramatic. In the irst molar \nregion of a dentate person, the average force has been mea-\nsured at 150 to 250 psi.108 A patient who grinds or clenches \ntheir teeth may exert a force that approaches 1000 psi. The \nmaximum occlusal force in an edentulous patient is reduced \nto less than 50 psi. The longer patients are edentulous, the \nless force they are able to generate. Patients wearing complete \ndentures for more than 15 years may have a maximum occlu-\nsal force of less than 6 psi.57\nAs a result of decreased occlusal force and the instability of \nthe denture, masticatory eficiency also decreases with tooth \nloss. Ninety percent of the food chewed with natural teeth its \nthrough a no. 12 sieve; this is reduced to 58% in the patient \nFIG 3.138 Proile view. Note the maxillary bone loss effect on \nthe lack of vermilion border of the lip, deep labial folds, and \nthe columella–philtrum angle. Yet the lower lip has a normal \nvermillion border and the muscles to the anterior lower jaw are \nstill attached, providing a normal contour. (From Misch CE: \nDental implant prosthetics, ed 2, St Louis, 2015, Mosby.)\nBOX 3.31 Esthetic Consequences of \nBone Loss\n• Decreased facial height\n• Loss of labiomental angle\n• Deepening of vertical lines in lip and face\n• Chin rotates forward—gives a prognathic appearance\n• Decreased horizontal labial angle of lip—makes patient \nlook unhappy\n• Loss of tone in muscles of facial expression\n• Thinning of vermilion border of the lips from loss of muscle \ntone\n• Deepening of nasolabial groove\n• Increase in columella-philtrum angle\n• Increased length of maxillary lip, so less teeth show at rest \nand smiling—ages the smile\n• Ptosis of buccinators muscle attachment—leads to jowls \nat side of face\n• Ptosis of mentalis muscle attachment—leads to “witch’s \nchin”\n(From Misch CE: Dental implant prosthetics, ed 2, St Louis, \n2015, Mosby.)\nand more dramatic facial changes with edentulism compared \nwith others. A thinning of the vermilion border of the lips \nresults from the poor lip support provided by the prosthesis \nand the loss of muscle tone. The maxillary retruded position \nis related to the loss of the premaxillary ridge and the loss of \ntonicity of the muscles involved in facial expression. The con-\ntraction of the orbicularis oris and buccinator muscles in a \npatient with moderate to advanced bone atrophy displaces \nthe modiolus and muscles of facial expression medially and \nposteriorly. As a result, a narrowing of the commissure, inver-\nsion of the lips, and hollowing of the cheeks are characteristic \nindings.\nA deepening of the nasolabial groove and an increase in \nthe depth of other vertical lines in the upper lip are related \nto normal aging but are accelerated with bone loss. This \nusually is accompanied by an increase in the columella-\nphiltrum angle. This can make the nose appear larger than if \nthe lip had more support (Fig. 3.138). Men often grow a \nmoustache to minimize this effect. The maxillary lip naturally \nbecomes longer with age as a result of gravity and loss of \nmuscle tone, resulting in less of the anterior teeth shown when \nthe lip is at rest. This has a tendency to “age” the smile because \nthe younger the patient, the more the teeth show in relation \nto the upper lip at rest or when smiling. Loss of muscle tone \nis accelerated in edentulous patients, and the lengthening of \nthe lip occurs at a younger age and is longer (showing less \nteeth) than dentate patients of a similar age. The upper lip \noften rolls over the incisal edge of the maxillary dentures, \nwhich further decreases the size of the vermilion border.\nThe attachments of the mentalis and buccinator muscles \nto the body and symphysis of the mandible also are affected \nby bone atrophy.

Awareness of movement of the mandibular denture \nwas cited by 62.5% of these patients, although the maxillary \nprosthesis stayed in place most of the time at almost the same \npercentage.\nPsychologic aspects of tooth loss. The psychologic \neffects of total edentulism are complex and varied and range \nfrom very minimal to a state of neuroticism. Although com-\nplete dentures are able to satisfy the esthetic needs of many \npatients, some believe their social lives are signiicantly \naffected. They are concerned with kissing and romantic situ-\nations, especially if a new partner in a relationship is unaware \nof their oral handicap. Fiske et al., in a study of interviews \nwith edentulous subjects, found tooth loss was comparable \nto the death of a friend or loss of other important parts of a \nbody in causing a reduction of self-conidence ending in a \nfeeling of shame or bereavement (Box 3.32).119\nImplant-Supported Overdenture  \n(Removable-RP4/RP5)\nAdvantages\nReduction in soft tissue coverage. The overdenture \n(RP4) may reduce the amount of soft tissue coverage and \nextension of the prosthesis. This is especially important for \nnew denture wearers, patients with tori or exostoses, and \npatients with low gagging thresholds. Also, the existence of a \nlabial lange in a conventional denture may result in exagger-\nated facial contours for a patient with recent extractions, \nwhich can result in chronic soreness. Implant-supported \nprostheses (RP4) do not require labial extensions or extended \nsoft tissue coverage. Note: An RP-5 prosthesis would have full \nperipheral acrylic extensions in the maxilla and mandible \n(i.e., mandible, buccal shelf support; maxilla, full palatal \ncoverage).\nIncreased retention. In general, an implant overdenture \nprosthesis will have signiicant retention in comparison to a \nconventional complete removable prosthesis. For example, a \ncomplete mandibular denture moves during most mandibular \nwearing complete dentures.109 A study of 367 denture wearers \n(158 men and 209 women) found that 47% exhibited a low \nmasticatory performance. The 10-fold decrease in force and the \n40% decrease in eficiency affect the patient’s ability to chew. In \npatients with dentures, 29% are able to eat only soft or mashed \nfoods, 50% avoid many foods, and 17% claim they eat more \neficiently without the prosthesis.110 Lower intakes of fruits, veg-\netables, and vitamin A by females were noted in this group. \nDenture patients also take signiicantly more drugs (37%) com-\npared with those with superior masticatory ability (20%), and \n28% take medications for gastrointestinal disorders. The \nreduced consumption of high-iber foods could induce gastro-\nintestinal problems in edentulous patients with deicient mas-\nticatory performance. In addition, the coarser bolus may impair \nproper digestive and nutrient extraction functions.111\nSystemic consequences. The literature includes several \nreports suggesting that compromised dental function causes \npoor masticatory performance and swallowing poorly chewed \nfood, which in turn may inluence systemic changes favoring \nillness, debilitation, and shortened life expectancy.112 In \nanother study, the masticatory performance and eficiency in \ndenture wearers were compared with those of dentate indi-\nviduals. This report noted that when appropriate corrections \nwere made for different performance norms and levels, the \nchewing eficiency of a denture wearer was less than one sixth \nof a person with teeth.113\nSeveral reports in the literature correlate a patient’s health \nand life span to dental health. Poor chewing ability may be a \ncause of involuntary weight loss in old age, with an increase \nin mortality rate.114 In contrast, patients with a substantial \nnumber of missing teeth were more likely to be obese. After \nconventional risk factors for strokes and heart attacks were \naccounted for, there was a signiicant relationship between \ndental disease and cardiovascular disease, the latter still \nremaining as the major cause of death.115\nSatisfaction of prosthesis. A dental survey of edentulous \npatients found that 66% were dissatisied with their \nmandibular complete dentures. Primary reasons were discom-\nfort and lack of retention causing pain and discomfort.116 Past \ndental health surveys indicate that only 80% of the edentulous \npopulation are able to wear both removable prostheses all the \ntime.117 Some patients wear only one prosthesis, usually the max-\nillary; others are only able to wear their dentures for short \nperiods. In addition, approximately 7% of patients are not able \nto wear their dentures at all and become “dental cripples” or “oral \ninvalids.” They rarely leave their home environment, and when \nthey feel forced to venture out, the thought of meeting and \ntalking to people when not wearing their teeth is unsettling.\nSpeech effects. A report of 104 completely edentulous \npatients seeking treatment was performed by Misch and \nMisch.118 Of the patients studied, 88% claimed dificulty with \nspeech, with one fourth having great dificulty. This most likely \noccurs with the mandible, which rests upon the buccinator \nmuscle and mylohyoid muscle when the posterior mandible \nresorbs. When the patient opens his or her mouth, the contrac-\ntion of these muscles acts like a trampoline and propels the \nlower denture off the ridge. As a result, the teeth often click \nBOX 3.32 Negative Effects of \nComplete Dentures\n• Bite force is decreased from 200 psi for dentate patients \nto 50 psi for edentulous patients\n• 15-year denture wearers have reduced bite force to 6 psi\n• Masticatory eficiency is decreased\n• More drugs are necessary to treat gastrointestinal disorders\n• Food selection is limited\n• Healthy food intake is decreased\n• The life span may be decreased\n• Reduced prosthesis satisfaction\n• Speech dificulty\n• Psychologic effects\n(From Misch CE: Dental implant prosthetics, ed 2, St Louis, \n2015, Mosby.)"

Periimplant probing is easier around a bar than a \nixed prosthesis because the crown contour often prevents \nstraight-line access along the abutment to the crest of the \nbone. The overdenture may be extended over the abutments \nto prevent food entrapment during function in the maxilla. \nWith a ixed implant prosthesis, hygiene is usually compli-\ncated because of the contours of the prosthesis in comparison \nto the implant position.\nLess trauma from parafunction. An overdenture may be \nremoved at bedtime to reduce the noxious effect of nocturnal \nparafunction, which increases stresses on the implant support \nsystem. In addition, a ixed prosthesis is not desired as often \nfor a long-term denture wearer. Long-term denture patients \ndo not appear to have a psychologic problem associated with \na removable implant prosthesis vs. a ixed prosthesis.\nEase of repair. The overdenture prosthesis is usually \neasier to repair than a ixed restoration. Reduced laboratory \nfees and fewer implants allow the restoration of patients at \nreduced costs compared with a ixed prosthesis. If a ixed \nprosthesis fractures (i.e., porcelain), remediation usually will \ninclude refabrication of the prosthesis.\nDecreased bone loss. In the areas of implant placement, \nbone atrophy will be reduced greatly in comparison to areas \nof edentulism. It has been shown in numerous studies that \nthe stimulation from the implants and/or prosthesis main-\ntains posterior bone volume.\nProsthesis may be upgraded. In most cases, an overden-\nture may be upgraded to a ixed prosthesis (i.e., as long \nas there exist no positioning or bone deiciency issues) \n(Box 3.33; Box 3.34). For example, a two-implant RP-5 man-\ndibular overdenture may be changed to a RP-4 by adding \n2 to 3 additional implants or an FP-3 ixed prosthesis by \nadding 3 to 4 additional implants in the mandible.\nDisadvantages\nPatient expectations. The primary disadvantage of a \nmandibular overdenture is related to the patient’s desire, pri-\nmarily when he or she does not want to be able to remove \njaw movements in function and speech. Studies have shown a \nmandibular denture may move approximately 10 mm during \nfunction. Under these conditions, speciic occlusal contacts \nand the control of masticatory forces are nearly impossible. An \nIOD provides improved retention and stability of the prosthe-\nsis, and the patient is able consistently to reproduce a deter-\nmined centric occlusion.120\nIncreased biting forces. Higher bite forces have been \ndocumented for mandibular overdentures on implants. The \nmaximum occlusal force of a patient with dentures may \nimprove 300% with an implant-supported prosthesis.121 A \nstudy of chewing eficiency compared wearers of complete \ndentures with wearers of implant-supported overdentures \n(IODs). The complete denture group needed 1.5 to 3.6 times \nthe number of chewing strokes compared with the overden-\nture group.122 The chewing eficiency with an IOD is improved \nby 20% compared with a traditional complete denture.123\nBetter speech. The contraction of the mentalis, buccina-\ntor, or mylohyoid muscles may lift a traditional denture off \nthe soft tissue. As a consequence, the teeth may touch during \nspeech and elicit clicking noises. The retentive IOD remains \nin place during most mandibular movements. The tongue \nand perioral musculature may resume a more normal posi-\ntion because they are not required to limit mandibular \ndenture movement. However, most patients will obtain better \nspeech with a RP-4 prosthesis, as a RP-5 overdenture tends to \nhave longer langes, which impinge on the musculature.\nDecreased number of implants. An overdenture also pro-\nvides some practical advantages over an implant-supported \ncomplete ixed partial denture. Fewer implants may be \nrequired when a RP-5 restoration is fabricated because soft \ntissue areas may provide additional support. The overdenture \nmay provide stress relief between the superstructure and \nprosthesis, and the soft tissue may share a portion of the \nocclusal load. Regions of inadequate bone for implant place-\nment may be eliminated from the treatment plan rather than \nnecessitating bone grafts or placing implants with poorer \nprognosis. As a result of less bone grafting and fewer implants, \nthe cost to treat the patients is dramatically reduced. An RP-4 \nprosthesis requires more implants than an RP-5; however, less \nthan a ixed prosthesis.\nEsthetics. The esthetics for many edentulous patients \nwith moderate to advanced bone loss are improved with an \noverdenture compared with a ixed restoration. Soft tissue \nsupport for facial appearance often is required for an implant \npatient because of advanced bone loss, especially in the \nmaxilla. Interdental papilla and tooth size are easier to repro-\nduce or control with an overdenture. Denture teeth easily \nreproduce contours and esthetics compared with time-\nconsuming and technician-sensitive porcelain metal ixed \nrestorations. The labial lange may be designed for optimal \nappearance, not daily hygiene. In addition, abutments do \nnot require a speciic mesiodistal placement position for an \nesthetic result because the prosthesis completely encompasses \nthe implant abutments.\nHygiene. Hygiene conditions and home and professional \ncare are improved with an overdenture compared with a ixed \nBOX 3.33 Mandibular Implant \nOverdenture Advantages\n• Prevents anterior bone loss\n• Improved esthetics\n• Improved stability (reduces or eliminates prosthesis \nmovement)\n• Improved occlusion (reproducible centric relation occlusion)\n• Decrease in soft tissue abrasions\n• Improved chewing eficiency and force\n• Increased occlusal eficiency\n• Improved prosthesis retention\n• Improved prosthesis support\n• Improved speech\n• Reduced prosthesis size (reduces langes)\n• Improved maxillofacial prostheses\n(From Misch CE: Dental implant prosthetics, ed 2, St Louis, \n2015, Mosby.)"

    "content": "143\nCHAPTER 3 Treatment Planning Complications\nAlthough porcelain fractures with a ixed restoration may \noccur and be costly to repair, over a lifetime the implant-\nsupported removable prosthesis is often more expensive.\nDenture teeth attrition. Denture teeth wear faster on an \nIOD (i.e., hybrid) than with a traditional denture because bite \nforce and masticatory dynamics are improved. A new over-\ndenture often is required at 5- to 7-year increments because \nof denture tooth wear and changes in the soft tissue support. \nPatient education regarding the long-term maintenance \nrequirement and the associated costs should be outlined at \nthe onset of implant therapy (Box 3.35).\nImplant-Supported Fixed Prosthesis (Fixed)\nAdvantages\nIdeal prosthesis. The implant-supported ixed prosthesis \nis the closest available treatment option for an edentulous \npatient to return to optimal form, function, and esthetics. \nMost patients receiving a ixed prosthesis will state that it \n“feels like normal teeth,” which carries a profound psycho-\nlogic impact. The prosthesis does not require removal and is \nless likely to impact food in comparison to a removable \nprosthesis.\nLess bone loss in cantilevered areas. Wright et al. have \nevaluated posterior mandibular bone loss in IODs (type 5 \nremovable prosthesis [RP-5]) compared with cantilevered \nixed prostheses from anterior implants.121 The annual bone \nloss index observed in the RP-5 overdentures ranged from \n+0.02 to −0.05 with 14 of 20 patients losing bone in the poste-\nrior regions. The ixed prostheses group had a range from \n+0.07 to −0.015 with 18 of 22 patients gaining posterior bone \narea. Reddy et al. also found a similar clinical observation in \n60 consecutively treated cantilevered ixed prostheses sup-\nported by ive to six implants placed between the foarmina.126 \nThe mandibular body height was measured 5, 10, 15, and \n20 mm distal to the last implant. The baseline measurements \nup to 4 years after function increased from 7.25 ± 0.25 mm to \n8.18 ± 0.18 mm. Nearly all of the bone growth occurred during \nthe irst year of function. An important role for the complete \nimplant-supported restoration is the maintenance and even \nregeneration of posterior bone in the mandible.\nDecreased maintenance. Because there are no attach-\nments utilized with a ixed implant prosthesis, there is far less \nmaintenance required. Less maintenance is associated with \nthe prosthesis. A ixed prosthesis often is perceived as an \nactual body part of the patient, and if a patient’s primary \nrequest is not to remove the prosthesis, an implant-supported \noverdenture would not satisfy the psychologic need of \nthe patient.\nFood impaction. Unlike the labial lange of a maxillary \ndenture, the labial lange of a mandibular overdenture rarely is \nrequired for esthetics. A mandibular overdenture often traps \nfood below its langes, similar to a denture. Dentures and RP-5 \nIODs are border molded to the muscle attachment level to \nallow the loor of the mouth to raise during swallowing. As a \nconsequence, food accumulates below the denture lange while \nthe muscles are at rest and then is compressed under the res-\ntoration during deglutition. The contour of a ixed restoration \nis less prone to food entrapment. The daily care for a bar IOD \n(RP-4) may be similar to that for a ixed mandibular restora-\ntion because ridge lap pontics are not required for esthetics or \nspeech, as with some maxillary ixed prostheses.\nMore maintenance. Removable overdentures require \ngreater maintenance and exhibit more frequent prosthetic-\nrelated complications than ixed restorations. For example, \nWalton and McEntee noted that there were three times more \nmaintenance and adjustments for removable prostheses com-\npared with ixed restorations.124 IODs often require attach-\nments to be changed or modiied every 6 months to 2 years, \nand denture teeth often wear, requiring a new prosthesis to \nbe fabricated every 5 to 7 years.125 In a review of literature by \nGoodacre et al., IODs have retention and adjustment prob-\nlems 30% of the time, relines 19% of the time, clip or attach-\nment fracture 17% of the time, and fracture of the prosthesis \n12% of the time.30 Fixed prostheses need less repair and less \nmaintenance and often last the life of the implant support. \nBOX 3.34 Implant Overdenture \nAdvantages vs. Fixed Prosthesis\n• Fewer implants (RP-5)\n• Less bone grafting required before treatment\n• Less speciic implant placement\n• Improved esthetics\n• Denture teeth\n• Labial lange\n• Soft tissue drape replaced by acrylic\n• Soft tissue considerations\n• Improved periimplant probing (follow-up)\n• Hygiene\n• Reduced stress\n• Nocturnal parafunction (remove prosthesis at night)\n• Stress relief attachment\n• Lower cost and laboratory cost (RP-5)\n• Fewer implants (RP-5)\n• Less bone grafting (RP-5)\n• Easy repair\n• Laboratory cost decrease (RP-5)\n• Transitional device is less demanding than a ixed \nrestoration\n(From Misch CE: Dental implant prosthetics, ed 2, St Louis, \n2015, Mosby.)\nBOX 3.35 Overdenture Disadvantages\n• Psychologic (need for nonremovable teeth)\n• Greater abutment crown height space required\n• More long-term maintenance required\n• Attachments (change)\n• Relines (RP-5)\n• New prosthesis every 7 years\n• Continued posterior bone loss\n• Food impaction\n• Movement (RP-5)\n(From Misch CE: Dental implant prosthetics, ed 2, St Louis, \n2015, Mosby.)"

The cost of a ixed prosthesis is higher than other \ntreatment plans, which may serve as a barrier to acceptance. \nIn patients with severe parafunction, the argument does arise \nfor fabrication of a removable overdenture as opposed to the \nporcelain ixed restoration as it is removable and is easily \nrepaired if needed.\nEsthetics. The esthetics for a ixed detachable prosthesis \nmay be inferior to an overdenture. Because soft tissue support \nfor facial appearance often is required for an implant patient \nwith advanced bone loss, a ixed prosthesis will usually not \nbe as soft tissue supportive as an overdenture. Because there \nis no labial lange with a ixed prosthesis, compromises in the \nsoft tissue may result. If overcontouring of the prosthesis is \ncompleted by the laboratory, this will often result in decreased \nhygiene.\nFood impaction. With a ixed prosthesis, a common com-\nplaint exists with an increase in food impaction. This will \nmost likely result when custom abutments are used to offset \nnonideal implant positioning. Because the prosthesis is \nFIG 3.139 Implant overdentures with posterior soft tissue \nsupport lose bone in the posterior regions almost 75% of the \ntime (purple bars). Fixed prostheses cantilevered from anterior \nimplants gain bone in the posterior regions more than 80% of \nthe time (blue bars).

    "content": "148\nRadiographic Complications and Evaluation\nRandolph R. Resnik, John W. Preece\n4 \nThe use of diagnostic imaging in implant dentistry has changed \ndramatically over the years. Comprehensive and accurate \nradiographic assessment is a crucial aspect of dental implant \ntreatment planning. Various imaging techniques have been \nused to evaluate bone quality, quantity, and location of ana-\ntomic structures in relation to proposed implant sites. Tradi-\ntionally, implant clinicians have relied on two-dimensional \nconventional radiographic modalities in implant dentistry. \nHowever, with the advent of computed tomography (CT) and \ncone beam computed tomography (CBCT), a new era in all \nphases of the radiographic imaging survey of implant patients \nhas become available. These technologic advances have signii-\ncantly increased the level of detailed information available to \nimplant clinicians in the diagnosis, treatment planning, surgi-\ncal, and prosthetic phases of dental implant treatment. This \nchapter will comprehensively review the use of various radio-\ngraphic modalities and technologies to avoid complications \nrelated to the presurgical evaluation, treatment planning, and \npostoperative assessment of implant treatment.\nRADIOGRAPHIC MODALITIES\n2-DIMENSIONAL\nPeriapical Radiograph\nPeriapical radiography, one of the most commonly used \nradiographic modalities in dentistry, has many advantages \nsuch as high resolution, low radiation, convenience, and image \nmodiication via digital software capability. However, the \nimplant clinician must understand the inherent disadvantages \nof this radiologic technique when used in oral implantology.\nLimitations\n• Image Distortion: Intraoral radiographs are inherently \nsusceptible to image distortion and magniication because \nthe object of interest does not have the same focal spot-\nto-object distance. When determining the location of ana-\ntomic structures, the clinician should note that the image \nmay contain distortion and that relying on exact measure-\nments from these images should be cautioned against. If \nthe x-ray beam is perpendicular to the image receptor \n(ilm or sensor) but the object is not perpendicular to \nthe image receptor and object, dimensional changes such \nas foreshortening and elongation will occur (Fig. 4.1). \nEdentulous sites/quadrants are especially predisposed to \nthese errors because lat maxillary palatal vaults along with \nhigh muscle attachments in the mandible make accurate \npositioning of the image receptor dificult.\n• Two-Dimensional Radiographic Modality: For ideal site \nassessment for dental implants, a true evaluation and deter-\nmination of the buccal-lingual available bone must be \ndetermined. Because periapical radiography anatomically \ncompresses the width dimension into a two-dimensional \nradiograph, important information cannot be obtained. \nTherefore when attempting to estimate width distances in \nclose approximation to maxillary and mandibular anatomic \nstructures with two-dimensional radiographs, the implant \nclinician must be continuously conscious of the inherent \ninaccuracies associated with two-dimensional images.\n• Identiication of Vital Structures: When evaluating the posi-\ntion of vital structures with intraoral radiographs, extreme \ncaution should be exercised. In the evaluation of the true \nlocation of the mental foramen, studies have shown less than \n50% of periapical radiographs depict the correct location of \nthe mental foramen.1 Other studies have concluded that, \nbecause of insuficient cortical bone around the mandibular \ncanal, only 28% of periapical radiographs will accurately \nidentify the mandibular canal.2 Therefore periapical radio-\ngraphs exhibit high false-positives and false-negatives with \nrespect to the identiication of vital anatomic structures.\nComplication Implications. Periapical radiographs have many \ninherent disadvantages, the most notable being that they provide \nonly a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional object. \nThe inability to determine the buccal-lingual bony dimensions \nis a major shortcoming with respect to implant treatment \nplanning. These radiographs are of little value in determining \nquantity and quality of bone, identifying vital structures, and \ndepicting the spatial relationship between structures within pro-\nposed implant sites. Thus, periapical radiographs should be \nlimited to an initial evaluation of a proposed implant site, intra-\noperative evaluation, and postoperative assessment.\nPanoramic Radiograph\nPanoramic radiography is a curved-plane tomographic \nradiographic technique used to depict the body of the man-\ndible, maxilla, and the maxillary sinuses in a single image. Its \nconvenience, speed, and ease have made this type of radiog-\nraphy a popular technique in evaluating the gross anatomy"

The degree of horizontal magniication \ndepends on the distance of the object from the focal \ntrough center and is inluenced by the patient’s anatomy \nand positioning within the panoramic machine. In \nthe anterior region the horizontal magniication will \nincrease signiicantly as the object moves away from the \nfocal trough. This results in anterior magniication \nbeing far greater and more variable than posterior \nmagniication.\n• Vertical magniication: Vertical magniication is deter-\nmined by the differences between the x-ray source and \nobject. Because the beam angle is directed at a negative \n(upward) angulation, structures positioned closer to \nthe source are projected higher within the image in \nrelation to structures positioned farther from the x-ray \nsource. Therefore the spatial relationships between \nobjects projected on a panoramic radiograph are inac-\ncurate (see Fig. 4.3).\n• Two-Dimensional Radiographic Modality: The pan-\noramic radiograph is a two-dimensional (2-D) image \ndepicting 3-dimensional (3-D) structures. Accordingly, it \ndoes not demonstrate the buccal-lingual dimension of \nof the jaws. However, the implant clinician must understand \nthe inherent fundamental limitations characteristic of this \ntype of radiograph.\nLimitations\n• Magniication/Distortion: All panoramic radiographs \nsuffer from vertical and horizontal magniication, along \nwith a tomographic section thickness that varies according \nto the anatomic position. Because the x-ray source exposes \nthe jaws utilizing a negative angulation (~8%) to avoid \nsuperimposing the occipital bone/base of the skull over \nthe anterior dental region, variable magniication will \nalways be present on panoramic radiographs. Increased \nmagniication stems from variances in patient positioning, \nfocal object distance, and the relative location of the rota-\ntion center of the x-ray system and variations in normal \nanatomic form and size from one patient to the next. \nZarch et al. have shown that 83% of panoramic measure-\nments are underestimated, with the greatest magniication \nbeing present in the anterior region (Fig. 4.2).3\n• Horizontal magniication: Horizontal magniication is \ndetermined by the position of the object within the \nFIG 4.1 Film positioning.

In the past, conventional \ncomputerized tomography, when used for dental implant \ntreatment planning, has been underutilized due to concerns \nrelated to potentially high radiation dose and lower resolution. \nBecause of the low radiation dose inherent with cone beam \ntechnology, the limitations of medical computerized tomogra-\nphy have been overcome. Additionally, this scanning technol-\nogy has advantages including potential “in-ofice” installation \nand use, which allow the clinician and patient the convenience \nof onsite scanning capabilities and treatment planning. In \naddition, for clinicians not wishing to invest in a personal \nCBCT unit, many major cities have specialized dental scanning \ncenters for referral for appropriate CBCT imaging.\nToday, CBCT imaging has become the gold standard for \ndental implant treatment planning. However, many implant \nclinicians lack the background and knowledge in evaluating \nand treatment planning with CBCT, thus predisposing to pos-\nsible complications. Therefore the implant clinician must have \na thorough understanding of inherent disadvantages of CBCT \nscans along with knowledge of applied head and neck anatomy, \nanatomic variants, incidental indings, and pathologic condi-\ntions with respect to implant treatment planning.\nCBCT Technology Complications\nSensor (Detector) Type. The x-ray sensor receives the x-rays \nand converts them into electrical data that are then converted \nto various images via special computer programs. There exist \ntwo types of sensors used today in CBCT technology: (1) \nimage intensiiers (IIs) with charged coupling devices (CCD) \nand (2) lat panel detectors (FPDs). Image intensiiers have \nmany disadvantages in comparison to lat panel detectors \nincluding poorer resolution, larger size, and a higher patient \nradiation dose requirement. Flat panel detectors, although \nmore expensive than image intensiiers, produce images with \nmuch higher quality and resolution. Most FPDs used today \nin CBCT units utilize cesium iodide (CsI) as the scintillator \ncrystal screen. Cesium iodide scintillators produce the highest \nspatial resolution possible among various CBCT screens.\nVoxel Size. The unit element in the 3-D image is termed the \nvoxel, which is analogous to the 2-D pixel. Images composed \nof multiple voxels are stacked in rows or columns that are \nisotropic (i.e., they have equal dimensions in the x, y, and z \nplanes) and range in size from 0.075 to 0.6 mm. Each indi-\nvidual voxel is assigned a grayscale value that corresponds to \nthe anatomic structures attenuation value. The smaller the \nvoxel size, the greater the resolution and quality of the image, \nbut also the greater the resultant radiation dose. A voxel size \nof 0.2 to 0.3 mm is considered ideal because it allows for an \nequitable trade-off between image quality and absorbed radi-\nation dose (Fig. 4.4).\nSpatial Resolution. Spatial resolution is measured in lines/\nmillimeter (lp/mm) and relates to the ability to distinguish \ntwo anatomically close objects. On a CBCT image, the higher \nthe spatial resolution, the greater the ability to delineate two \nmaxillofacial structures; therefore bone width and vital \nstructures cannot be determined. Additionally, it produces \na lattened, spread-out image of curved structures, which \nresults in signiicant distortion of the vital structures and \ntheir relationship in space.\n• Identiication of Vital Structures: Panoramic radiogra-\nphy does not exhibit an accurate assessment of bone \nquality/mineralization, and it does not truly identify and \nlocate vital structures accurately.\n• Visibility of mandibular canal: Lindh has shown that \nthe mandibular canal cortical walls were visible in only \n36.7% of panoramic radiographs.4\n• Mental foramen location: Yosue et al, in evaluation of \nthe mental foramen, concluded that over 50% of radio-\ngraphs will not depict the true location of the mental \nforamen.1\n• Linear measurements: Sonic et al have shown an inac-\ncuracy rate of 24% in determination of linear measure-\nments for bone assessment with respect to vital \nstructures.5\n• Anterior loops: Studies completed by Kuzmanovic \net al of anterior loops (mental nerve courses anteriorly \nto the mental foramen), concluded panoramic radio-\ngraphs exhibit a high incidence of false positives and \nfalse negatives, making them totally inaccurate.6\n• Location of septa: In evaluation of maxillary sinus loor \nbony septa by Krenmair et al, correct identiication and \nlocation has been shown to be approximately 21.3%.7\n• Identiication of accessory foramina: Accessory \n(double) foramina have been shown to accurately iden-\ntiied in less than 50% of panoramic radiographs.8\nComplication Implications. Although panoramic radio-\ngraphs have historically been the gold standard in evaluating \npotential implant sites, many disadvantages are associated \nwith these types of radiographs. A lower resolution prevents \nevaluation of the ine detail that is required for the assessment \nof osseous structures and anatomy. The magniication in the \nhorizontal and vertical planes is nonuniform; thus linear \nmeasurements are inaccurate (Fig. 4.3). Often the image has \nsuperimposition of real, double, and ghost images, which \nresult in dificulty in visualizing anatomic and pathologic \ndetails. The true positions of important vital structures, \nwhich are crucial in dental implant treatment, are not easily \nseen or incorrectly depicted. Therefore panoramic radio-\ngraphs have value for initial evaluation; however, they predis-\npose the implant clinician to many surgical, prosthetic, and \nmedicolegal complications.\nCONE BEAM TOMOGRAPHY\n3-DIMENSIONAL\nTo overcome some of the disadvantages of two-dimensional \nradiographs and conventional medical CT scanners, a new type \nof computed tomography speciic for dental applications has \nbeen developed.

In contrast, conventional radiography requires a \nminimum of 10% difference in physical density to be seen.9 \nEach medical CT image is composed of pixels and voxels, \nwhich are characterized by a given numeric value, which \nrelect the x-ray beam attenuation. These values are directly \naffected by the density and thickness of the tissue. The Houn-\nsield units (HU), or CT numbers, correlate with the density \nof the medical CT image and range in value from −1000 (air) \nto +3000 (enamel). A speciic shade of gray or density number \nis assigned to each CT number, which ultimately forms the \nimage. The correlation of these CT numbers has been used \nto associate the density of the area of interest with various \nbone densities used for surgical and prosthetic treatment \nplanning. Thus the gray values depicted on medical CT \nimages are considered true attenuation x-ray values (HU) \n(Fig. 4.5).\nBone Density: Dental CBCT. When evaluating dental CBCT \nimages in regards to bone density, there does not exist a direct \ncorrelation (accuracy of measurement) as compared with \nmedical CT. Most dental CBCT systems inherently have an \nincreased variation and inconsistency with density estimates. \nThe density estimates of gray levels (brightness values) are \nnot true attenuation values (HU); thus, inaccuracies in bone \ndensity estimates result.10 This is mainly due to the high level \nof noise in the acquired images and the slight inconsistencies \nin the sensitivity of the CBCT detectors. Dental imaging soft-\nware frequently provides attenuation values (HU); however, \nsuch values should be recognized as approximations lacking \nthe precision of HU values derived from medical CT units.\nArtifact Complications\nBeam Hardening. Because metallic objects in the oral cavity \nare associated with higher attenuation coeficients than soft \ntissue, dental CBCT images inherently are predisposed to \nthese artifacts. One of the most common types of artifacts is \ntermed beam hardening. Beam hardening occurs when x-rays \ntravel through the bone/implant, resulting in more low-\nenergy photons being absorbed than high-energy photons. \nBecause of this the image will have compromised image \nquality.11 The titanium alloy surface is highly susceptible to \nthese types of artifacts because of the high-density nature \nof the metal. This results in inaccuracies, especially when \nviewing periimplant bone levels. Conventional intraoral \nimages will not exhibit these beam-hardening artifacts and \nmay appropriately be used to better evaluate the quality and \ndifferent objects from one another. Normally, CBCT scanners \n(voxel size 0.075–0.6 mm) are most commonly associated \nwith higher spatial resolution than medical grade scanners \n(voxel size 0.6–1 mm). However, decreased spatial resolution \non CBCT images may result from: (1) the use of a higher \nvoxel size (> 0.4) (i.e., use of voxel sizes > 0.3 mm for implants \nis not recommended due to the lower spatial resolution), (2) \ndecreased radiation (kVp or mA), which results in increased \nnoise, (3) metallic restorations resulting in artifacts, and (4) \nincreased focal spot size.\nContrast Resolution. Contrast resolution is deined as the \nability to differentiate tissues of different radiodensities. In \nimplant dentistry, the ability to produce different shades of \ngray is important for a clearly diagnostic image. Because \nCBCT images utilize less radiation and are produced with \nlower kVp (peak kilovoltage) and mA (milliamperage) set-\ntings in comparison to MDCT units, dental CBCT images are \nassociated with slightly higher image contrast, modiiable \nthrough software settings. Dental CBCT images generally \nhave increased noise and image scatter compared to medical \nunits. To minimize noise and scatter, a smaller FOV may be \nused. However, smaller FOVs are usually associated with \nslightly higher radiation settings.\nBit Depth. The quality of CBCT images is directly related to \nthe number of shades of gray (bit depth). Currently, CBCT \nunits produce up to 16-bit images, which corresponds to (216) \n65,536 shades of gray. However, computer monitors may \ndisplay up to only 8 bits (28) 256 shades of gray. To increase \nthe quality of the image, the monitor brightness and contrast \nmay be adjusted to display 8 bits per image.\nBone Density: MDCT. Medical CT data permit differentiat-\ning between tissues that have a physical density of less than \nFIG 4.5 Hounsield units correlation with bone density \nclassiication. \nD1:\n>1250 HU\nD2:\n850 – 1250 HU\nD3:\n350 – 850 HU\nD4:\n150 – 350 HU\nFIG 4.4 Comparison of volume data sets obtained isotropi-\ncally (left) and anisotropically (right). Because CBCT data \nacquisition depends on the pixel size of the area detector and \nnot on the acquisition of groups of rows with sequential \ntranslational motion, the compositional voxels are equal in all \nthree dimensions, rather than columnar, with height being \ndifferent from the width and depth dimensions.

Additionally, higher-density materials \ncommonly found in the oral cavity (e.g., amalgam, gold) will \nlead to complete absorption of the beam and beam-hardening \nartifacts.12 There exist two types of beam-hardening artifacts \nthat result in linear areas of dark bands or streaks between \ndense objects and cupping artifacts. Cupping artifacts occur \nwhen x-rays pass through the center of a highly dense object \nand are absorbed more than the peripheral x-rays. This results \nin an image in which a uniformly dense object appears to be \nless dense (darker, lower CT numbers) at its center and \nappears as a “cup” (Fig. 4.6).\nMotion-Related Artifacts. Motion artifacts are usually the \nresult of patient movement and result in the inaccurate \ndepiction of bony landmarks, measurements, and implants.13 \nPatient movements and incorrect patient positioning create \nblurring problems, double density line artifacts adjacent to \nmajor bony structures that result in nondiagnostic images. \nPatients should be instructed to not move and avoid swallow-\ning throughout the scan. The motion blurring causes “double \ncontours” of anatomic structures that result in decreased scan \nquality and spatial resolution. This may lead to improper \nimplant placement and possible damage to neural struc-\ntures.14 Motion-related artifacts may be decreased by using \nsit-down CBCT units or head restraints, or by decreasing \nscanning times (Fig. 4.7).\nStreak Artifacts. CBCT images are susceptible to streak \nartifacts caused by x-rays traveling through objects with a \nhigh atomic number (metallic restorations). Streak artifacts \nusually are seen as light and dark lines that arise from the \nsource object, resulting in images with decreased quality and \nobscuring of anatomic structures (Fig. 4.9).\nScatter. Another disadvantage inherent with CBCT images \nis scatter, which is most commonly produced from metallic \nrestorations. This is caused by photons (x-rays) that are \ndelected from their original path by metallic objects. When \nthese delected photons reach the sensor (detector), the inten-\nsity of the signal is magniied in a nonuniform magnitude. \nThe end result is an image with decreased resolution and \nimage quality, which ultimately leads to inaccuracies in the \nreconstructed CT number or voxel density.15 The ield of view \n(FOV) of the CBCT is proportional to the amount of scat-\ntering; thus smaller FOVs are associated with less scattering. \nCBCT images have inherently greater scatter radiation than \nmedical-grade CT images (Fig. 4.9).16\nNoise. There are two types of noise associated with CBCT \nimages: additive (results from electrical noise) and photon-\ncount (quantum noise). Because CBCT operate at much \nlower amperage (mA) settings than MDCT scanners, CBCT \nimages are associated with greater quantum noise. The noise \nis displayed as a “graining” of the image and is the result \nFIG 4.6 Beam hardening, which results in radiolucency sur-\nrounding the implant that frequently is misdiagnosed as a \nfailing implant.

Price et al showed a high incidence (3.2 indings/\nscan) of incidental indings with approximately 16% requir-\ning intervention or referral.19 These incidental indings \nranged from common benign indings to signiicant patho-\nlogic conditions. Miles reported a minimum of two report-\nable indings per CBCT and also showed a high incidence of \nperiapical lesions that went undetected on conventional \nradiographs.20 Cha determined after evaluation of 500 scans \nan incidence of 24.6% of incidental indings, most in the \nairway region.21 Arnheiter showed patients 40 to 49 years old \nhad the largest percentage of reportable incidental indings \n(70%), with patients aged 20 to 29 years old with the lowest \npercentage (40%).22\nObtaining a Radiology Report. Radiology reports immedi-\nately after CBCT exams, prior to surgery, minimize the lia-\nbility that may present to the implant clinician. Formal \nradiology reports may be obtained from many sources, \npreferably from an appropriately qualiied, board-certiied \nmaxillofacial radiologist. Unfortunately, the geographic dis-\ntribution of maxillofacial radiologists is not uniform within \nstates or regions within a state, and a careful search will be \nrequired. Several, but not all, states require that the report \nbe made by a maxillofacial radiologist licensed in the \nstate, and it is therefore crucial to check with your local \ndental board or dental practice act to determine if in-state \nlicensure is required. The implant clinician must be able \nto recognize and evaluate variations from normal and refer \nfor appropriate medical consultation any signiicant inci-\ndental inding that may be contained in the radiology \nreport.\nUse of the Smallest FOV as Possible. Ideally, the smallest \nFOV should be utilized for scans when treatment planning \nfor dental implants (Fig. 4.11). A smaller FOV (~Mid FOV) \nwill reduce radiation dose to the patient, thus adhering to \nthe ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle. \nHowever, caution should be exercised to not take an inade-\nquate FOV that includes insuficient view of the anatomic \narea of concern. The most common anatomic area for \nthis to occur is the maxillary posterior region because many \npractitioners will set the limits of the scan superiorly/\ncoronally to exclude the maxillary ostium. When placing \nimplants or bone grafting in the posterior maxilla area, \nconirming the patency of the ostium is important to \nminimize complications associated with an obstructed osteo-\nmeatal complex.\nNORMAL RADIOGRAPHIC ANATOMY\nDue to the complex nature of implant treatment and the \npotential for complications throughout the surgical and pros-\nthetic phases, the clinician must have a thorough understand-\ning of the normal anatomy of the maxillofacial region. \nTraditional dental education has focused on the interpreta-\ntion of conventional 2-D radiographic images for diagnosis, \nreformation. Cotton rolls, tongue depressors, or a bite reg-\nistration may be used. Additionally, cotton rolls may be placed \nin the vestibule to separate the lips and cheeks from the \nbuccal mucosa. This will allow for a more accurate represen-\ntation of the contour and thickness of the gingival tissues.\nPosition of the Scanning Template. The position of the \nscanning template/radiographic markers in the mouth during \nCBCT examination is crucial for the accuracy of fabrication \nof the surgical template. First, it is recommended that an \nindex be used to position the scanning template in the correct \nposition. The ideal index includes a radiolucent bite registra-\ntion, which will allow for the teeth to be separated and main-\ntain the patient in centric relation. This will prevent \ninaccuracies and help stabilize the template in the mouth. \nAdditionally, denture adhesive should be used with the CBCT \ntemplate to keep it in the ideal position.\nMucosal Thickness. When fabricating mucosa-supported \nsurgical guides, the thickness of the mucosa may have a direct \neffect on the accuracy of the of the planning of the implant \nsites. Increased mucosa thickness may lead to inaccurate \nplacement of the mucosa-borne guides during the surgical \nplacement procedure. Vasek showed a 1.0-mm buccal mucosa \nthickness may result in a buccal-lingual deviation of over \n0.41 mm.17 This will inevitably cause inaccurate measure-\nments and possible misalignment of the surgical guide when \nplacing the implants. When signiicant atrophy is present in \nthe premaxilla, usually there will be excessive tissue thickness, \nwhich will result in rocking of the template. \nCBCT ANATOMIC RADIOGRAPHIC\nANATOMY\nIncidental Findings\nThe role of CBCT is rapidly emerging in all aspects of diagnosis \nand treatment planning with dental implants. Because of varying \nFOVs, the implant clinician is placed in a position to evaluate \nmaxillofacial areas that they may not be familiar with. Therefore \nit is crucial the implant clinician be able to interpret anatomic \nstructures and pathology outside their primary area of interest. \nIn radiology, an incidental inding is deined as an unexpected \ndiscovery found on a radiologic examination performed for an \nunrelated reason. Unfortunately, many normal anatomic vari-\nants, developmental anomalies, and imaging artifacts may be \nmisidentiied as possible pathologic conditions by inexperi-\nenced clinicians.18 This may lead to unnecessary concern and \nstress for patients and embarrassment for the clinician. Addi-\ntionally, possible signiicant pathologies may exist that go undi-\nagnosed. This problem results in many professional, ethical, \nclinical, and potential legal issues for the implant clinician.\nComplication Prevention\nUnderstanding Incidence of Incidental Findings.

When \nevaluating the intraosseous course of the mandibular canal \nbuccal-lingually and inferior-superiorly within the mandible, \nmany variations exist based on gender, ethnicity, amount of \nbone resorption, and age.\nBuccal-Lingual Mandibular Canal Locations\nRadiographic evaluation. In the posterior region of the \nmandible, the inferior alveolar nerve enters the mandibular \nforamen on the lingual surface of the mandible and pro-\ngresses anteriorly in the body of the mandible. In between the \nmandibular canal and the mental foramen, the buccal-lingual \nposition is extremely variable. Studies have shown the buccal-\nlingual location is dependent on such variables as the amount \nof bone resorption, age, and ethnicity.23 The buccal-lingual \nposition of the mandibular canal is easily depicted on \ncross-sectional images after canal location is veriied and \nhighlighted (Fig. 4.12).\nFIG 4.11 Examples from the i-CAT FLX Cone Beam 3D system depicting of different ield of \nviews for speciic areas of interest.

The intraosseous path of the man-\ndibular canal is variable in the buccal-lingual position within \nthe mandible, and a comprehensive radiographic survey \n(CBCT) ideally should be completed prior to implant \nosteotomy initiation to determine the anatomic path. A \n2-millimeter safety zone between the implant and the man-\ndibular canal should always be adhered to. Attempting to \nplace an implant buccal or lingual to the neurovascular \nbundle may result in neurosensory impairment.\nInferior-Superior Mandibular Canal Locations\nRadiographic evaluation. The vertical position of the \nmandibular canal below the apices of the natural teeth \nwithin the mandible is also highly variable. Therefore, \ngeneralizations cannot be made as to a constant inferior-\nsuperior position because the distance of the canal to the root \napices is not consistent.24 An early classiication of the vertical \npositions of the course of the alveolar nerve was reported by \nCarter and Keen.25 They described three distinct types: (1) in \nclose approximation to the apices of the teeth, (2) a large \nnerve approximately in the middle of the mandible with indi-\nvidual nerve ibers supplying the mandibular teeth, and (3) a \nnerve trunk close to the inferior cortical plate with large \nplexuses to the mandibular teeth. After the mandibular canal \nis located and drawn on the reconstructed panoramic image \nusing CBCT viewing software, the vertical position of the \nintraosseous path may be determined by scrolling through \nthe cross-sectional images.

Studies have shown the \nforamen to be located approximately 19.7 mm from the \nanterior border of the ramus.29 The CBCT data are used with \nappropriate viewing software to identify and trace the MC. \nThe depiction of the MC enables the implant clinician to \nassess the position in various multiplanar and 3-D reforma-\ntions. Initially, the MC is most easily drawn on the CBCT \nreconstructed panoramic view with location conirmation \non the cross-sectional images. In most cases, the endpoints \nare irst identiied (e.g., mandibular foramen, mental \nforamen), then the location of the MC is extrapolated \nbetween these two landmarks.\nRadiographic Complication. In many instances the man-\ndibular canal may not be easily depicted on the CBCT \nimage; thus identiication can be extremely challenging. The \nvisibility of the MC varies signiicantly, even within the same \nindividual.\nThe mandibular canal walls usually are not made up of \ncompact bone, showing only a coalescence of trabecular bone \nwith varying degrees of density.2 This complicates the deter-\nmination and location of the true identiication of the canal. \nStudies have shown that the unreliability of identifying the \nentire MC course is a direct result of minimal to no dense \ncortical plates surrounding the nerve bundle, which has been \nshown to occur in approximately 30% of cases. The MC has \nan increased wall density in the posterior region (mandibular \nforamen > third molar region) in comparison to the anterior \nregion.30\nWith CBCT, images are susceptible to noise and artifacts, \nwith resulting low contrast. Because of these inherent quality \nissues, distinguishing the mandibular canal from other \naspects of the internal trabecular components of the man-\ndibular image may be dificult. Thus, the clinician should be \nbe proicient at utilizing available tools within the software \nprograms to be able to identify the mandibular canal.\nMental Foramen\nThe mental foramen is an opening in the anterolateral aspect \nof the mandible, commonly in the apical space in the irst and \nsecond premolar area; however, individuals may rarely exhibit \nthe position of the foramen as anterior to the cuspid area and \nas far posteriorly as the bifurcation of the irst molar. One of \nthe two terminal branches of the inferior alveolar nerve is the \nmental nerve, which exits the mental foramen with sensory \ninnervation to the chin, lip, and anterior gingiva. The mental \nforamen completes in formation after the 12th gestational \nweek, when the mental nerve separates into several fascicles. \nIf the mental nerve separates prior to the formation of the \nmental foramina, the formation of a accessory foramen may \nosteotomy. Special care should be exercised in type 1 nerves \nbecause their close approximation to the root apexes results \nin compromised bone height for implant placement. Imme-\ndiate implant placement in the mandibular posterior when a \ntype 1 nerve exists is not recommended. Type 3 nerves \nare most favorable for implant placement in the posterior \nmandible because the mandibular canal is positioned low \nin the mandible, therefore having increased available bone \nin height. \nMandibular Canal\nThe inferior alveolar canal (IAC), or mandibular canal (MC), \ncontains the neurovascular bundle, which consists of the infe-\nrior alveolar nerve, artery, vein, and lymphatic vessels. The \ninferior alveolar nerve bundle enters the mandibular foramen, \nwhere it transverses anteroinferiorly from lingual to buccal \nwithin the body of the mandible. A 3-D evaluation of the MC \nposition is recommended when implant placement is going \nto be completed in proximity to the nerve. The most accurate \nassessment of the anatomic position is with CBCT because \nimages may be enhanced via viewing software adjustments \nfor contrast, brightness, and gray scale to help depict the \nanatomic location of the MC.\nImage Evaluation. Radiographically, the MC appears as a \nlinear, radiolucent shadow with or without inferior and \nsuperior radiopaque borders. Studies have shown the total \nlength to be approximately 62.5 mm, with slightly longer \nmeasurements in males (+~2.5 mm).26 The average diameter \nof the MC is approximately 2.0 to 3.4 mm with the diameter \nbeing the greatest in the posterior near the mandibular \nFIG 4.12 Variable buccal-lingual position.

Such a bony \npattern makes it dificult to trace the canal posterior from \nthe mental foramen (Fig. 4.14).\nMandibular Ramus (Donor Site for  \nAutogenous Grafting)\nThe mandibular ramus area has become a very popular donor \nsite for autogenous onlay and trephine bone grafting. This \nanatomic area of the mandible is extremely variable in the \namount of bone present, as well as the buccal-lingual and \ninferior-superior position of the mandibular canal. Most com-\nmonly, the lateral aspect of the ramus is harvested as a block \ngraft, which is used for ridge augmentation procedures.\nImage Evaluation. The mandibular ramus is quadrilateral \nand contains two surfaces, four borders, and two processes. \nThe lateral surface is lat with two oblique ridges, the external \nand internal. The masseter muscle attaches on the entire \nlateral ramus surface. The medial surface gives rise to the \nlingula, which is the entrance of the inferior alveolar nerve \nand associated vessels. When present, the antegonial notch, \nanterior to the angle of the mandible, is signiicant for the \npresence of parafunction.\nThe relationship between the lateral cortical plate in the \nramus area and the position of the mandibular canal is \neasily seen on cross-sectional images after nerve location \nidentiication. Additionally, 3-D images and bone models \nassist in the determination of the osseous morphology in \nthis region to help the clinician select the most appropriate \ngraft site.\nRadiographic Complication. Historically, standard 2-D \nradiographs for evaluation of the ramus area as a donor site \nincluded conventional panoramic images, in which the loca-\ntion of the external oblique and the mandibular canal may \nbe noted. However, 2-D evaluation of this area can be very \ndificult to use for determination of the amount of bone \npresent and position of the mandibular canal. With this pro-\ncedure it is vital that the implant clinician be able to com-\npletely determine the exact position of the mandibular canal \nwith respect to the external oblique ridge and the lateral corti-\ncal bone.

High false-positive and false-negative results \nhave been noted on conventional panoramic and periapical \nradiographs. To identify an anterior loop on a reformatted \nCBCT image, the mandibular canal must be highlighted, \nincluding the cross-sectional image depicting the mental \nforamen slice. The anterior part of the mental foramen is \nmarked with a constant perpendicular line (line will remain \nconstant throughout all the images). In sequential axial \nimages, scrolling from superior to inferior, any component of \nthe nerve anterior to the constant line is considered a anterior \nextension. If an anterior loop exists, the highlighted nerve will \nbe anterior to the perpendicular line (Fig. 4.17).\nClinical Signiicance. Determining the presence of an ante-\nrior loop is critical when placing implants anterior to the \nmental foramen. Inability to establish the existence of an \nanterior loop may result in implant placement too close to \nthe mental nerve, resulting in possible neurosensory impair-\nment and related complications.\nAccessory Foramens\nIn approximately 6.6% to 12.4 % of patients, an accessory \n(double) foramen is present with an average diameter of \n1.0 mm.33-35 Special care should be noted to evaluate for an \nand measurements cannot be determined with 2-D radiog-\nraphy.

A thin cortical \noutline, poorly deined internal bony trabecular pattern, and \nvariable density within the cortical layer are potential indica-\ntions of osteoporosis/osteopenia. In 30% of cases, no superior \ncortical plate is present, which complicates the identiication \nof the true location (see Fig. 4.14 C–D).\nRadiographic Evaluation. The brightness and contrast may \nbe altered using imaging software to more clearly deine the \ncanal walls. Ideally, the mandibular canal may be seen easiest \nin the panoramic or cross-sectional images.\nClinical Signiicance. Lack of identiication of the MC may \nresult in placement of implants too close to the nerve result-\ning in possible nerve damage. Additionally, when hypomin-\neralization is present, usually the bone density throughout the \nmandible will be poor and compromised (~D4).\nIncisive Canal\nThe mandibular incisive canal is a bony canal within the \nanterior mandible that is a continuation of the MC. This \ncanal contains the terminal branch of inferior alveolar nerve, \nwhich travels inferiorly to the mandibular anterior teeth and \nterminates in the midline. In approximately the irst molar \nregion, the inferior alveolar nerve bifurcates into the mental \nand incisive nerves. The mandibular incisive canal terminates \nas nerve endings within the anterior teeth or bone near the \nlateral incisor region and will extend only to the midline in \n18% of patients, and in some cases will anastomosis with the \ncontralateral side.40\nRadiographic Evaluation. The incisive canal is not always \nseen radiographically on CBCT. The incisive nerve may be \ndifferentiated from the mental nerve by determination of \nany canal that is anterior to the mental nerve/foramen exit. \nWhen present, this radiolucent canal will continue anteriorly \nfrom the mental foramen and can be seen as a bifurcation \nwith branches in the superior direction (Fig. 4.20).\nClinical Signiicance. The incisive canal is often mistaken \nfor an anterior loop of the mental nerve, but this nerve inner-\nvates the anterior teeth and has no sensory innervation to the \nsoft tissue. However, if the incisive canal is traumatized, cases \nof excessive bleeding have been reported. Usually the canal \nand its branches will become necrotic after the teeth are \nextracted.\nRetromolar Foramen\nThe retromolar fossa of the mandible forms a triangular \ndepression that borders the temporal crest medially and the \nanterior border of the mandibular ramus laterally. Within \nthis fossa, an anatomic variant termed the retromolar \nforamen (RMF) is present in approximately 14% of patients.41 \nA signiicant plexus of sublingual and submental arteries may \nlead to life-threatening loor-of-the-mouth hematoma for-\nmation.

If an \nimplant osteotomy is completed in this area, perforation of \nthe lingual plate may result, leading to possible bleeding and \npossible implant morbidity. Life-threatening lingual bleeding \nmay occur as a result of blood vessel injury leading to bleed-\ning into the soft tissues.

These calciications \ngive radiographic evidence of atherosclerosis, which is an \nindicator of possible stroke or metabolic disease. It has been \nshown that approximately 80% of strokes are ischemic and \ndue to atherosclerotic disease in the carotid bifurcation.43\nRadiographic Evaluation. Carotid artery calciications are \nsmall, multiple radiopacities in the carotid space anterior and \nlateral to cervical vertebrae C3-C4. These multiple and irreg-\nularly shaped calciications may be vertical in orientation \nand are usually easily distinguished from the adjacent \nsoft tissue. They can be easily seen on axial and 3-D images \n(Fig. 4.22 A–B). An additional common site to evaluate for \ncarotid artery calciications in large-volume CBCT images is \nlateral to the pituitary fossa.\nClinical Signiicance. Because of the signiicant complica-\ntions that may arise from the presence of carotid calciica-\ntions (ischemic cerebrovascular disease is the second leading \ncause of death in most developed countries), the patient \nshould be referred to their physician for assessment of carotid \nartery stenosis and possible ultrasound evaluation.\nMAXILLARY ANATOMY\nThe maxilla is composed of paired bones (right and left) that \nunite to form the upper jaw and is composed of four pro-\ncesses: posterolateral (zygomatic, horizontal, and medial); \npalatine, arch and inferior; alveolar; and the superior project-\ning frontal process. In oral implantology, the maxilla presents \na dificult and demanding challenge in the treatment and \nplacement of implants with its complex osseous makeup, \nanatomy, and anatomic variants.\nPremaxilla\nThe anterior premaxilla is one of the most dificult areas \nfor the implant clinician in preoperative assessment, surgical \nplacement, and esthetic and prosthodontic demands. Numer-\nous factors affect the anatomic makeup of the premaxilla that \nmay predispose to surgical complications and result in a \ndecrease in implant survival.\nRadiographic Evaluation. The premaxilla is a dificult and \ncomplex region of the oral cavity to evaluate clinically and \nradiographically. Many factors complicate this area, such as \nthe trajectory of the anterior maxilla, rapid buccal bone \nresorption after tooth loss, decreased bone density, and a \nhighly esthetic demanding area. The premaxilla may be easily \nevaluated via cross-sectional, sagittally, and 3-D.\nClinical Signiicance. As a result of the alveolar ridge \nresorption after tooth loss, the residual available bone \nmigrates to a more palatal position.44 This leads to dificulties \nin implant positioning that place the implant clinician at risk \nRadiographic Evaluation. Lingual canals and foramina may \nbe seen radiographically as a radiolucent canal in the midline \nof the mandible and easily depicted on cross-sectional or \naxial views. Studies have veriied the median vascular canal is \npresent in 96% to 100% of patients. The median vascular \ncanal size is proportional to the diameter of the arteries enter-\ning the foramen. The average diameter has been shown to be \napproximately 0.84 mm, with the average distance from the \ninferior mandibular border to be 11.2 mm. With consider-\nation to the extent of penetration within the mandible, 19.4% \nof canals end within the lingual third, 52.8% reach the middle \none third of the mandible, and 27.8 % penetrate to the buccal \none third (Fig. 4.21).42\nClinical Signiicance. Potentially, these vessels may cause \nextensive bleeding in the mandible during endosseous \nimplant placement or symphysial bone grafts. When larger \nlingual canals exist (>1.0 mm), signiicant bleeding issues \nmay present with a possible compromised integration \nbecause of a potential soft tissue interface with the implant. \nUsually bleeding may be slowed or stopped by inserting a \nsurgical drill, direction indicator, or implant into the oste-\notomy site.\nFIG 4.20 The incisive canal is a continuation of the inferior \nalveolar canal, which contains the incisive nerve, which inner-\nvates the mandibular anterior teeth (red shows the inferior \nalveolar canal; green shows the incisive canal).

The entrance of the canal into the oral cavity is via the \nincisive foramen, which is posterior to the central incisor \nteeth. The vital structures passing through the canal include \nthe terminal branch of the internal maxillary artery and \nthe nasopalatine nerve, which communicates with the sphe-\nnopalatine artery and the greater palatine nerve. The ana-\ntomic structures (e.g., nerve artery, vein) in the nasopalatine \ncanal may present with wide variation in the location, shape, \nand dimensions. \nRadiographic Evaluation. The location and dimension of \nthe nasopalatine canal is most likely seen on axial and coronal \nimages. Cross-sectional and 3-D images may also depict the \nsize, shape, and location of the nasopalatine canal along with \nevaluation of implant impingement on this space.\nClinical Signiicance. Determining the morphology of the \nnasopalatine canal via CBCT images allows the clinician to \ndue to esthetic issues. Because bone resorption occurs at the \nresult of the buccal plate, implant placement usually occurs \nin a more palatal position. This results in a greater moment \nforce leverage on the bone-implant interface, abutment \nscrews, and implants. Coupled with an angled force in both \ncentric and excursions, more stress is transmitted to premax-\nillary implants than those in anterior mandibles. This often \ndictates more implants and larger-diameter implants with \nbone augmentation by bone-spreading or bone graft proce-\ndures before or in conjunction with implant placement.\nIn most patients, the bone is less dense in the anterior \nmaxilla than in the anterior mandible. The maxilla most often \npresents thin porous bone on the labial aspect, very thin \nporous cortical bone on the loor of the nasal and sinus \nregion, and a denser cortical bone on the palatal aspect.45 The \ntrabecular bone in the premaxilla is usually ine and less \ndense than the anterior region of the mandible. Due to this \npoor bone quality, increased dificulty in implant placement \nand a higher probability of overload implant failures or \ncrestal bone loss may result.\nBecause of the poor bone quality in the premaxilla, preex-\nisting bone after extractions is predisposed to signiicant \nresorption. After tooth loss, the facial cortical plate rapidly \nresorbs during initial bone remodeling, and the anterior ridge \nhas been shown to lose up to 25% of its width within the irst \nyear, as well as 40% to 50% within the next 3 to 5 years, \nmostly at the expense of the labial contour (Fig. 4.23A–B). \nFIG 4.21 Mandibular vascular canal.

Incisive canal cysts are known to cause \nlocalized dilation of the canals with possible displacement of \nthe teeth. In edentulous patients, the nasopalatine canal has \nbeen shown to be signiicantly larger in comparison to that \nof dentate patients (Fig. 4.24).\nWhen implants are positioned in contact with neural \ntissue, lack of osseointegration and failure of the implant may \nresult.

Especially with immediate implant place-\nment, consideration must be given to the presence of the naso-\npalatine canal, including a careful evaluation of its morphology \nand position to minimize implant placement complications.\nThe incisive foramen often expands laterally within the \npalatal bone, and the central incisor implant osteotomy may \ninadvertently encroach on this structure, resulting in the for-\nmation of ibrous tissue at the interface in the mesiopalatal \nregion.

The \nmaxillary sinus has a high prevalence of anatomic variants \nand pathology, which predispose the patient to increased \nmorbidity during procedures in the posterior maxilla. Thus, \na comprehensive knowledge and understanding of this area \nis important for implant clinicians. Radiographically, the \nmaxilla sinus has the following borders: Superiorly, the max-\nillary sinus is bordered by the orbital loor, which houses the \ninfraorbital canal. Inferiorly, the loor of the maxillary sinus \napproximates the roots of the maxillary teeth. The medial \nwall coincides with the lateral wall of the nasal cavity and is \nthe location of the maxillary ostium, the area of drainage of \nthe ethmoid infundibulum (Fig. 4.26).\nNasal Cavity\nThe borders of the nasal cavity are: hard palate (inferior); \nmedial walls of the right and left maxillary sinus (lateral); \nnasal, ethmoid, and sphenoid bones (superior); and nasal \nseptum (medial). The lateral walls of the nasal cavity are \nmade up of turbinates (concha), which are epithelium-lined \nbony structures that protrude into the nasal cavity and func-\ntion to warm, cool, and ilter inspired air. Below each turbi-\nnate are spaces termed meatuses. The middle meatus is most \nimportant because this is the area of drainage for the frontal, \nanterior ethmoid, and maxillary sinuses. The inferior meatus \nis the drainage site for the nasolacrimal duct. The superior \nmeatus interconnects with the posterior ethmoid and sphe-\nnoid sinuses through the sphenoethmoidal recess.50\nMaxillary Sinus Membrane\nThe maxillary sinus is lined by the Schneiderian membrane, \nwhich is identical to respiratory epithelium. This pseu-\ndostratiied columnar epithelium is continuous with the nasal \nEthmoid. The ethmoid sinuses are within the ethmoid bone \nand are divided into two compartments, the anterior and \nposterior. The anterior ethmoid sinus drains into the middle \nmeatus, and the posterior ethmoids drain into the spheno-\nethmoidal recess. The borders of the ethmoid sinuses include: \nanterior ethmoid (lateral): lamina papyracea of the orbit \n(medial); middle turbinate (superior): fovea ethmoidalis \n(cribriform plate); posterior ethmoid (lateral): lamina papy-\nracea of the orbit (medial); superior turbinate (superior); \nfovea ethmoidalis (cribriform plate). The ethmoid sinuses \nhave various radiographic anatomic markers that are termed \nair cells. The ethmoid bulla are the largest and most promi-\nnent radiographically in the anterior region. Agger nasi cells \nare usually the most anterior of the anterior air cells and are \nlocated in anterior/superior to the middle turbinate. Along \nthe inferior border of the orbits are the Haller cells, which \nmay impair mucociliary clearance when they enlarge and \nimpinge of the ethmoid infundibulum. The Onodi cells derive \nfrom the posterior ethmoid and are located lateral and supe-\nrior to the sphenoid sinus.48\nSphenoid. The sphenoid sinus, located within the sphenoid \nbone, contains superiorly the pituitary fossa and olfactory \nnerves. Inferiorly, the pterygoid canal courses beneath the \nmucosa with the cavernous portion of the internal carotid \nartery within the lateral wall. The ostium lies in the superior \naspect and drains into the sphenoethmoidal recess.49\nMaxillary. The maxillary sinuses are the largest of the paired \nparanasal sinuses and an often problematic area for implant \nclinicians. The posterior maxilla has many inherent disadvan-\ntages including poor bone density, minimal interocclusal \nspace, and insuficient bone quantity for ideal implant place-\nment. Thus, the implant clinician must have a comprehensive \nFIG 4.26 Normal paranasal sinus anatomy images.

The main drainage avenue of the maxil-\nlary sinus is through the ostium. The maxillary ostium is \nbounded superiorly by the ethmoid sinuses and inferiorly by \nthe uncinate process. The maxillary sinus ostium is on the \nsuperior aspect of the medial wall of the sinus, approximately \nhalf-way between the anterior and posterior walls. The ostium \nis usually oval shaped and oriented horizontally or obliquely.52\nRadiographic evaluation. The maxillary ostia are visual-\nized on coronal images, usually in the anterior one third of \nthe maxillary sinus. This opening is located in the superior \naspect of the maxillary sinus medial (lateral wall of nasal \ncavity). The patency of the maxillary ostium should always \nbe ascertained when placing implants or bone grafts into the \nmaxillary sinus. By scrolling through various coronal images, \nthe opening can be veriied (Fig. 4.28).\nClinical signiﬁcance. If the maxillary ostium is non-\npatent, the mucociliary clearance of the maxillary sinus may \nbe affected. This can lead to an increased morbidity in \nimplant-related procedures.\nInfundibulum/Hiatus Semilunaris. Vital structures within \nthe osteomeatal complex that allow for mucociliary drainage \nof the sinuses are the maxillary infundibulum and the hiatus \nsemilunaris. Drainage through the maxillary ostium enters \nthe maxillary infundibulum, which is a pathway that leads to \nthe hiatus semilunaris. The hiatus semilunaris is a crescent-\nshaped space or opening in the lateral wall of the nasal cavity, \nwhich is inferior to the ethmoid bulla that is the location for \nthe openings of the frontal sinus, maxillary sinus, and ante-\nrior ethmoid sinus. These sinuses drain through this area into \nthe middle meatus.\nRadiographic interpretation. The maxillary infundibu-\nlum and hiatus semilunaris are easily seen on coronal sections \nof the patient’s maxillary anatomy. These crucial areas of the \nmaxillary osteomeatal complex is bounded anteriorly and \ninferiorly by the uncinate process of the ethmoid bone, supe-\nriorly by the ethmoid bulla, and posterior by the inferior \nnasal concha.\nClinical signiﬁcance. Any blockage of the infundibulum \nor hiatus semilunaris will lead to inlammation, congestion, \nor infection in the maxillary, ethmoid, or frontal sinuses. \nTherefore, prior to any procedures that may violate the maxil-\nlary sinus (e.g., implant, bone graft), the patency of infun-\ndibulum and hiatus semilunaris must be veriied to decrease \nthe possibility of postoperative complications.\nUncinate Process. The uncinate process is an important \nstructure in the lateral wall of the nasal cavity. This inger-like \nbony projection helps form the boundaries of the hiatus \nsemilunaris and ethmoid bulla, which allow the draining of \nthe frontal and maxillary sinuses.\nRadiographic evaluation. On coronal or cross-sectional \nCBCT images the uncinate process is bordered by the medial \nepithelium through the maxillary ostium in the middle meatus. \nThe membrane has an average thickness of 0.8 mm and is \nusually thinner and less vascular than nasal epithelium.51\nRadiographic Evaluation. A CBCT scan of normal, healthy \nparanasal sinuses reveals a completely radiolucent (dark) \nmaxillary sinus. Any radiopaque (whitish) area within the \nsinus cavity is abnormal, and a pathologic condition should \nbe suspected. The normal sinus membrane is radiographi-\ncally invisible, whereas any inlammation or thickening of \nthis structure will be radiopaque. The density of the diseased \ntissue or luid accumulation will be proportional to varying \ndegrees of gray values (Fig. 4.27).\nClinical Signiicance. Ideally, when evaluating the maxil-\nlary sinus, it should be completely radiolucent. If any radi-\nopaque areas are present, this is most likely the result of a \ndisease process (e.g., inlammation, cystic, polyps). Therefore, \nif implant placement into the maxillary sinus is planned, the \ndegree of radiopacity is signiicant to the long-term success \nand morbidity. In some cases, treatment may be indicated \nprior to entry (i.e., implant placement or bone grafting) into \nthe maxillary sinus.\nOstiomeatal Complex\nThe ostiomeatal unit is composed of the maxillary ostium, \nethmoid infundibulum, anterior ethmoid cells, uncinate \nprocess, and the frontal recess. This anatomic area allows air \nlow and mucociliary drainage into the middle meatus.\nRadiographic Evaluation. The osteomeatal complex can be \nevaluated radiographically most easily on a coronal scan, \nwhich includes the following structures:\n1. Maxillary sinus ostium\n2. Infundibulum\nFIG 4.27 The maxillary sinus membrane (Schneiderian mem-\nbrane) in health should be invisible (red arrow).

The inferior edge of the middle turbinate may have \nvarious shapes exhibiting excessive curvature that may pre-\ndispose the patient to blockage in the nasal cavity, infundibu-\nlum, and middle meatus.56\nRadiographic Evaluation. A paradoxical middle turbinate \nis most easily seen on a coronal CT/CBCT scan image. It may \nalso be seen in certain cross-sectional images. The convexity \nof the paradoxical middle turbinate is directed laterally, \ninstead of medially toward the nasal septum.\nClinical Signiicance. When a paradoxical middle turbi-\nnate is present, the implant clinician must take into \nconsideration the possibility of postoperative mucociliary \ncomplications after bone grafting or implant placement in \nthe maxillary sinus from blockage of the ostium (Fig. 4.30).\nDeviated Septum\nOne of the most common anatomic variants in the oral \nregion is a deviated septum, which may be congenital or \ntraumatic in origin. Studies have shown a prevalence of 70%, \nwhich increases the possibility of osteomeatal complex block-\nage. This occurs when the nasal septum is displaced laterally \ntowards one side of the nasal cavity. When the deviation is \nsevere, the low of air through the nasal cavity is redirected \nbulging of the middle ethmoidal cells and may be a pneuma-\ntised cell or a bony prominence.\nRadiographic Interpretation: The ethmoid bulla are \nusually evaluated on coronal images. These air cells are part \nof the anterior ethmoid sinuses and make up the superior \nborder of the hiatus semilunaris and maxillary infundibulum \nand laterally bounded by the lamina papyracea.\nClinical Signiicance. The degree of pneumatization \nwithin the ethmoid bulla varies. When enlarged, the bulla \nmay encroach upon the uncinate process and middle turbi-\nnate, resulting in nonpatency of the osteomeatal complex. \nThe patency of this area should be veriied prior to any pro-\ncedures involving the maxillary sinus.\nANATOMIC VARIANTS OF THE  \nMAXILLARY ANATOMY\nConcha Bullosa\nThe middle turbinate plays a signiicant role in proper drain-\nage of the maxillary sinus. Normally, the middle turbinate is \na thin, boney structure; however, it can be aerated, in which \ncase it is termed a concha bullosa. This anatomic variant can \nbe unilateral or bilateral and has been shown to have a preva-\nlence of up to 53.6% of the population.53 Additionally, there \nis a strong association with the concha bullosa and a deviated \nseptum of the contralateral side.54\nRadiographic Evaluation. Concha bullosa are easily identi-\nied on a CT/CBCT coronal image as a radiolucent air space \nin the center of the middle meatus and surrounded by an \novoid bony rim.\nClinical Signiicance. In most cases of concha bullosa, no \nparanasal sinus pathology results. The larger the concha \nbullosa, the more likely the probability of compromising the \ndrainage of the middle meatus.

They are usually present unilaterally \nwith a prevalence of approximately 6% of the population.57 \nThe origin of Haller cells is the anterior ethmoid (88%) and \nposterior ethmoid (12%).58\nRadiographic Evaluation. Haller cells are identiied on \ncoronal images that are located inferior to the ethmoid bulla \nand adhering to the medial roof of the orbit, lateral to the \nuncinate process.\nClinical Signiicance. These air cells may expand into the \norbit and narrow the ostium of the maxillary sinus, especially \nin the presence of an infection. Haller cells have been associ-\nated with a high incidence of chronic rhinosinusitis because \nthey may impinge on the patency of the maxillary ostium, \nthus inhibiting ciliary function.

Maxillary septa complicate sinus \ngraft surgery and can prevent adequate access and visualiza-\ntion to the sinus loor; therefore inadequate or incomplete \nsinus grafting is possible. Additionally, a higher incidence of \nmembrane perforation results when septa are present.\nMaxillary Sinus Hypoplasia\nHypoplasia of the maxillary sinus may be a direct result of \ntrauma, infection, surgical intervention, or irradiation to the \nmaxilla during the development of the maxillary bone. These \nor other congenital developmental conditions interrupt the \nmaxillary growth center, thus producing a smaller-than- \nnormal maxilla. A malformed and positioned uncinate \nprocess is associated with this disorder, leading to chronic \nsinus drainage problems.\nRadiographic Evaluation. Smaller-than-normal maxillary \nsinus volume can be seen on panoramic, cross-sectional, \ncoronal, axial, or 3-D images.\nClinical Signiicance. Most often, these patients have ade-\nquate bone height for endosteal implant placement, and a \nsinus graft is not required to gain vertical height. If implant \nplacement or bone grafting involves the maxillary sinus, \ncaution should be exercised, as this condition has been associ-\nated with chronic sinus disease. (Fig. 4.34A–B)\nInferior Turbinate and Meatus Pneumatization \n(Big-Nose Variant)\nA rather uncommon anatomic variant, the big-nose variant, \noccurs when the inferior third of the nasal cavity exhibits \npneumatization within the maxilla and resides over the alveo-\nlar residual ridge. Studies have shown an incidence of approx-\nimately 3%. Because the maxillary sinus is lateral to the \nedentulous ridge, there exists inadequate bone height.\nRadiographic Evaluation. Big-nose variants may be deter-\nmined by evaluation on conventional or reconstructed pan-\noramic images because the nasal cavity will extend distal or \nposterior to the premolar area.\nClinical Signiicance. If this condition is not taken into \naccount, the implant may be placed into the nasal cavity \nabove the residual ridge and often may penetrate into the \ninferior meatus and contact the inferior turbinate. A sinus \ngraft is contraindicated with this patient condition because \nthe sinus is lateral to the position of the implants. Instead, \nan onlay graft is required to increase bone height \n(Fig. 4.34C–D).\nBuccal Thickness of Bone in Premaxilla\nOn average, maxillary buccal cortical plates are less than \n1-mm thick, signiicantly thinner than the mandibular alveo-\nlar bones, which are greater than 1 mm. Thin cortical plates \nAgger Nasi Cells\nAgger nasi cells are the most anterior ethmoidal air cells, \nextending anteriorly into the lacrimal bone. They can be \nidentiied on CT/CBCT in over 90% of patients and have a \nhigh incidence of frontal sinusitis.59\nRadiographic Evaluation. Agger nasi cells are most easily \nseen in CT/CBCT coronal images as they lie anterior, lateral, \nand inferior to the frontal recess and borders the primary \nostium of the frontal sinus (Fig. 4.32).\nClinical Signiicance. These cells may predispose the \npatient to postoperative sinus complications. Their size may \ndirectly inluence the patency of the frontal recess and the \nanterior middle meatus, thus indirectly affecting the patency \nof the osteomeatal complex.\nMaxillary Sinus Septa\nAntral septa (buttresses, webs, and struts) are the most \ncommon osseous anatomic variants seen in the maxillary \nsinus. Underwood, an anatomist, irst described maxillary \nsinus septa in 1910. Krennmair et al further classiied these \nstructures into two groups: primary, which are a result of the \ndevelopment of the maxilla, and secondary, which arise from \nthe pneumatization of the sinus loor after tooth loss.7 The \nprevalence of septa has been reported to be in the range of \n33% of the maxillary sinuses in the dentate patient and as \nhigh as 22% in the edentulous patient. The most common \nlocation of septa in the maxillary sinus has been reported to \nbe in the middle (second bicuspid–irst molar) region of the \nsinus cavity. CT scan studies have shown that 41% of septa \nare seen in the middle region, followed by the posterior \nregion (35%) and the anterior region (24%). For diagnosis \nand evaluation of septa, CT scans are the most accurate \nmethod of radiographic evaluation.60\nRadiographic Evaluation. 3-D images depict the anatomic \nfeatures of septa most easily on CBCT images.

The signs and symp-\ntoms of acute rhinosinusitis are rather nonspeciic, making \nit dificult to differentiate from the common cold, inluenza \ntype of symptoms, and allergic rhinitis. However, the most \ncommon symptoms include purulent nasal discharge, facial \npain and tenderness, nasal congestion, and possible fever. \nAcute maxillary rhinosinusitis results in 22 to 25 million \npatient visits to a physician in the United States each year, \nwith a direct or indirect cost of 6 billion US dollars. Although \nfour paranasal sinuses exist in the skull, the most common \ninvolved in sinusitis are the maxillary and frontal sinuses.65\nRadiographic Appearance. The radiographic hallmark in \nacute rhinosinusitis is the appearance of an air-luid level. A \nline of demarcation will be present between the luid and the \nair within the maxillary sinus. If the patient is supine (CBCT), \nthe luid will accumulate in the posterior area; if the patient \nis upright during the imaging, the luid will be seen on the \nloor and accumulate horizontally. Additional radiographic \nsigns include smooth, thickened mucosa of the sinus, with \npossible opaciication. In severe cases the sinus may ill com-\npletely with supportive exudates, which gives the appearance \nof a completely opaciied sinus. With these characteristics, the \nterms pyocele and empyema have been applied (Fig. 4.38).\nFIG 4.38 Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. (A) Coronal scan \nshowing bilateral air-luid level.

    "content": "177\nCHAPTER 4 Radiographic Complications and Evaluation\nRadiographic Appearance. Fungal rhinosinusitis is usually \nunilateral (78% of cases) with bony destruction very rare. \nWithin the sinuses the presence of mild thickening to com-\nplete opaciication may be present. In most cases, varying \ndegrees of density (“double-densities”) are seen. The majority \nof maxillary sinuses exhibiting fungal disease will radiograph-\nically show near complete opaciication. Depending on the \ninvasiveness of the disease, expansion of the involved sinus \nmay occur and possibly remodeling, thinning, or erosion of \nthe sinus walls may be seen radiographically (Fig. 4.40).\nDifferential Diagnosis. Three possible clinical signs may \ndifferentiate fungal sinusitis from acute or chronic rhinosi-\nnusitis: (1) no response to antibiotic therapy, (2) soft tissue \nchanges in sinus associated with thickened reactive bone, \nwith localized areas of osteomyelitis, and (3) association of \ninlammatory sinus disease that involves the nasal fossa and \nfacial soft tissue. In some cases a positive diagnosis may \nrequire mycologic and histologic studies.\nCYSTIC LESIONS\nCystic lesions are a common occurrence in the maxillary sinus, \nand studies have reported a prevalence range of 2.6% to 20%.68 \nThey may vary from microscopic lesions to large, destructive, \nexpansile pathologic conditions that include pseudocysts, reten-\ntion cysts, primary mucoceles, and postoperative maxillary cysts.\nPseudocysts (Mucous Retention Cyst)\nThe most common cysts in the maxillary sinus are mucous \nretention cysts. After much controversy, in 1984, Gardner69 dis-\ntinguished two categories of these cysts: (1) pseudocysts and (2) \nretention cysts. Pseudocysts are more common and of much \ngreater concern during sinus graft surgery compared with reten-\ntion cysts. Pseudocysts reoccur in approximately 30% of patients \nand are often unassociated with sinus symptoms. As a conse-\nquence, many physicians do not treat these lesions. However, \nwhen their size is larger than 10 mm in diameter, pseudocysts \nmay occlude the maxillary ostium during a sinus graft procedure \nand increase the risk of postoperative infection.\nRadiographic Appearance. Pseudocysts are depicted radio-\ngraphically as smooth, homogenous, dome-shaped, round-to-\novoid, well-deined homogeneous radiopacities. Pseudocysts \ndo not have a corticated (radiopaque) marginal perimeter and \nare always on the loor of the sinus cavity. As their name states, \nthey are not true cysts (e.g., pseudocyst), therefore do not have \nan epithelium lining (Fig. 4.41).\nDifferential Diagnosis. The pseudocyst is easily identiied in \ncomparison to other cystic lesions (e.g., retention, mucocele, \npolyps) by being dome-shaped and only located on the loor \nof the sinus. \nRetention Cysts\nRetention cysts may be located on the sinus loor, near the \nostium, or within antral polyps. Because they contain an \nDifferential Diagnosis. The differential diagnosis of acute \nrhinosinusitis and prolonged viral upper respiratory infec-\ntion are very similar. However, a classic air-luid level in the \nmaxillary sinus will give rise to the conirmation of acute \nrhinosinusitis. Additionally, viral rhinosinusitis will usually \nimprove within 7 to 10 days, whereas acute bacterial rhinosi-\nnusitis persists for longer than 10 days.66\nChronic Rhinosinusitis\nChronic rhinosinusitis is a term used for a rhinosinusitis that \ndoes not resolve in 6 weeks and also has recurrent episodes. \nIt is the most common chronic disease in the United States, \naffecting approximately 37 million people. Symptoms of \nchronic rhinosinusitis are associated with periodic episodes \nof purulent nasal discharge, nasal congestion, and facial pain.\nRadiographic Appearance. Chronic rhinosinusitis has the \ncharacteristic feature of sclerotic, thickened cortical bone \nfrom long-lasting mucoperiosteal inlammation. Addition-\nally, it may appear radiographically as thickened sinus mucosa \nto complete opaciication of the antrum.\nAllergic Rhinosinusitis\nAllergic rhinosinusitis is a local response within the maxillary \nsinus caused by an irritating allergen in the upper respiratory \ntract. The allergen may be the cause of the allergic rhinosi-\nnusitis. This category of rhinosinusitis may be the most \ncommon form, with 15% to 56% of patients undergoing \nendoscopy for sinusitis showing evidence of allergy. Allergic \nrhinosinusitis leads to chronic rhinosinusitis in 15% to 60% \nof patients.67 The sinus mucosa becomes irregular or lobu-\nlated, with resultant polyp formation.\nRadiographic Appearance. Polyp formation related to \nallergic rhinosinusitis is usually characterized by multiple, \nsmooth, rounded, radiopaque shadows on the walls of the \nmaxillary sinus. Most commonly, these polyps are located \nnear the ostium and are easily observed on a CBCT scan. In \nadvanced cases, ostium occlusion, along with displacement \nor destruction of the sinus walls, may be present, with a \nradiographic image showing a completely opaciied sinus \n(Fig. 4.39).\nDifferential Diagnosis. Although the radiographic signs of \nallergic rhinosinusitis may be similar to acute/chronic rhino-\nsinusitis, a thorough medical history may be used to differ-\nentiate. Most patients with allergic rhinosinusitis will have \nsystemic systems (e.g., bilateral involvement) and also have a \npast history of allergy issues.\nFungal Rhinosinusitis (Eosinophilic  \nFungal Rhinosinusitis)\nGranulomatous rhinosinusitis is a very serious (and often \noverlooked) disorder within the maxillary sinus. Patients who \nhave fungal sinusitis are thought to have had an extensive \nhistory of antibiotic use, chronic exposure to mold or fungus \nin the environment, or are immunocompromised."

The primary maxillary sinus muco-\ncele has clinical and radiographic similarities to chronic rhi-\nnosinusitis, fungal rhinosinusitis, or neoplasm. Patients that \npresent with these signs and symptoms should be referred for \nproper diagnosis and treatment.\nPostoperative Maxillary Cyst\nA postoperative maxillary cyst of the maxillary sinus is a \ncystic lesion that usually develops secondary to a previous \ntrauma or surgical procedure in the sinus cavity. It has also \nbeen termed a surgical ciliated cyst, postoperative maxillary \nsinus mucocele, or a secondary mucocele.71\nRadiographic Appearance. The cyst radiographically pres-\nents as a well-deined radiolucency circumscribed by sclero-\nsis. The lesion is usually spherical in the early stages, with no \nbone destruction. As it progresses, the sinus wall becomes \nthin and eventually perforates. In later stages, it will appear \nas two separated anatomic compartments (Fig. 4.43).\nDifferential Diagnosis. The postoperative maxillary cyst is \neasily differentiated from other lesions present in the maxil-\nlary sinus as the patient will have had a past history of sinus \nsurgery and radiographically there will be two distinct radio-\nlucent cavities.\nNEOPLASMS\nSquamous Cell Carcinoma, Adenocarcinoma\nMalignant tumors of the paranasal sinuses are rare, with a \npoorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma comprising \napproximately 80% of tumors. Seventy percent of these \ntumors are found in the maxillary sinus.72 Symptoms can \nvary; however, neoplasms of the maxillary sinus usually \ninclude nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, epistaxis, cranial \nneuropathies, and pain. Advanced cases may include visual \ndisturbances, paresthesias, and possible malocclusion.\nRadiographic Appearance. Radiographic signs of neo-\nplasms may include various-sized radiopaque masses, com-\nplete opaciication, or bony wall changes. A lack of a posterior \nwall on a radiographs should be a sign of possible neoplasm \n(Fig. 4.44).\nDifferential Diagnosis. A maxillary sinus neoplasm may \nshow signs and symptoms similar to chronic rhinosinusitis, \nprimary maxillary sinus mucocele, fungal rhinosinusitis, or \nallergic rhinosinusitis. An opaciied sinus or bony expansion \nshould result in immediate referral. \nANTROLITHS\nMaxillary Sinus Antroliths\nMaxillary sinus antroliths are the result of complete or partial \nencrustation of a foreign body that is present in the sinus. \nThese masses found within the maxillary sinus originate from \na central nidus, which can be endogenous or exogenous.73\nRadiographic Appearance. The radiographic appearance \nof a maxillary antrolith resembles either the central nidus \n(retained root) or appears as a radiopaque, calciied mass \nwithin the maxillary sinus (Fig. 4.45).\nDifferential Diagnosis.

These include: (1) the existing or duplicate prosthesis \nwith radiopaque markers, (2) a thermoplastic template with \nradiographic markers, and (3) use of radiopaque teeth in a \nmucosa or tooth-supported template. Care should be taken if \nthe existing prosthesis is utilized, and any esthetic or functional \nchanges should be made prior to scanning.\nClinical Complication. If a radiopaque template is not uti-\nlized, the ideal positioning may not be determined. For cases \ninvolving minimal edentulous sites, interactive treatment \nplanning software may be used to fabricate the position of \nthe replacement teeth (e.g., Virtual Teeth, Materialize Dental). \nFor full-arch edentulous cases, a radiopaque template or a \ndual scan protocol should be utilized (Fig. 4.47 A–B).\nLack of Radiopaque Template Stability\nIf any instability is present in the radiopaque template, inac-\ncuracies may result with the interactive treatment planning. \nThe inal positioning of the implants and the inal prosthesis \nmay be compromised. Because of the need for ideal implant \nplacement, denture adhesive or reline of the prosthesis should \nbe used for the scan. If not, the prosthesis might be canted, \nthus altering the anatomy and placement of the implants. On \nCBCT images, a radiolucent space will be present showing a \nvoid and improper positioning of the prosthesis.\nComplications Prevention. The radiopaque template should \nalways be evaluated for midline veriication, ideal occlusal \nplane, and approved esthetics. This will minimize the possibil-\nity of transferring incorrect information to be used for the \nimplant placement position and surgical guide preparation. A \nwell-itting prosthesis with denture adhesive or reline should \nbe used to help stabilize the prosthesis along with a bite regis-\ntration. The patient should maintain the teeth in together (i.e., \nslightly out of occlusion) during the scan (Fig. 4.48).\nInability to Identify Mandibular Canal\nIdentiication of Mandibular Canal Methods. The accurate \nidentiication of the mandibular canal is crucial for preopera-\ntive treatment planning for implant placement in the posterior \nmandible. Because the amount of available bone height present \nbetween the alveolar ridge and the mandibular canal dictates \nthe positioning and size of the dental implant, any inaccuracies \nmay lead to an increased morbidity. Because of the inability to \nascertain cortical borders in the MC and with varying trabecu-\nlation, in some cases it may be dificult to determine the exact \nlocation. Studies have shown the visibility of the MC decreases \ntowards the mental foramen. This unreliability of visualization \nof the MC near the mental foramen is due to the lack of dei-\nnite walls in the anterior portion of the canal. Even with the \nwide variation of CBCT images, the ability to identify this \nstructure is dependent on the density of the bone and MC.\nLofthag-Hansen et al determined that the mandibular \ncanal is only visible on one third of cross-sectional images. \nHowever, when other images (sagittal and axial) were evalu-\nated, the visibility of the MC increased signiicantly to \napproximately 87%.

Deviation of the nasal septum \nis considered a variation in normal anatomy; referral and \ntreatment is not indicated unless the patient provides a \nhistory of dificulty breathing through their nose.”\n• Clinical Signiicance: Identiication of possible changes \nin the nasal cavity potentially inluencing breathing \npatterns.\nAir Space. Variations in the size of the airway are noted in \nthe section as well as potential enlargements of the adenoid \nand pharyngeal tonsils.\nTypical report indings might read: “Narrowing of the \nairway has been associated with a variety of respiratory dis-\norders including an increased risk of obstructive sleep apnea. \nCorrelation of the radiographic observation with the patient’s \nclinical history is suggested. Clinical evaluation of the soft \ntissues of the oral pharynx is suggested.”\n• Clinical Signiicance: Identiication of possible airway \nchanges affecting patient breathing patterns.\nTMJ. This section reports on variations and deviations in \nsymmetry between the right and left condyles, articular \nfossae, and joint spaces.\nTypical report indings might read: “The right condyle, \narticular fossa, and joint space exhibited normal bony proiles \nand contours; the left articular fossa and joint space exhibited \nnormal radiographic contours; the left condyle exhibits a \nlocalized discontinuity the cortical outline, the presence of \nresorption lacunae, and sclerosis of the underlying bony tra-\nbecular pattern consistent with DJD. Correlation of the \nradiographic observation with the patient’s clinical indings \nand symptoms, if any, is suggested.”\n• Clinical Signiicance: Identiication of possible radio-\ngraphic changes within the bony structures of the TMJ \nregion affecting patient symptoms/occlusion. TMJ-\npositive indings may predispose the patient to pros-\nthetic rehabilitation complications.\nOther Findings. This section is used to report radiographic \nchanges in anatomic structures not associated with the \nmaxilla and mandible but included within the volume includ-\ning, but not limited to: calciications within the carotid artery \nlateral to the pituitary fossa and within the lower neck; radio-\ngraphically visible changes within the cervical vertebra \nincluding osteophyte formation, sclerosis, narrowing, and \nirregularity of intervertebral disk space width with potential"

(A) Minimal information report. \nContinued\nbone to bone contact; generalized loss or thinning of cortical \nbone and an absence of internal bony trabeculation sugges-\ntive of systemic metabolic disorders of bone/osteoporosis; \nincreased density noted within one or both mastoid pro-\ncesses. Common incidental radiographic indings included \nhere would be: calciication the stylohyoid ligament, calciica-\ntions of pineal gland and cavernous sinus (middle cranial \nfossa area), idiopathic soft tissue calciications within the soft \ntissues of the skin or soft tissues of the oral pharynx (tonsil-\nloliths), salivary gland/duct calciications, metallic foreign \nbodies, ear wax, etc.\nStyles of Radiology Reports\nEach radiologist has their own style and format they use to \nconstruct a report, and it is appropriate for the referring clini-\ncian to do their “due diligence” and select the radiologist who \nwill provide the kind of report they are comfortable using as \na basis for treatment planning decisions. Examples of radiol-\nogy report templates are shown in Fig. 4.52. For example, \nsome radiologists specify that their review of the volume is \nthrough the assessment of “axial cross sections only,” which \nlimits the potential of visualization of radiographic anoma-\nlies when CBVT volumes and the software used easily provide \naxial, coronal, and sagittal cross sections. Our suggestion is to \nidentify a radiologist who provides interpretation based on a \ncomplete analysis of the volume utilizing axial, coronal, and \nsagittal cross sections.\nSUMMARY\nOne of the keys to preventing potential complications during \nthe surgical and prosthetic phases of implant treatment is to \nhave as clear a picture of the patient’s current anatomic \nmakeup as possible. Identifying deiciencies of bone allows \nthe clinician to modify the bony architecture to achieve \noptimal implant location for prosthetic success. Knowing the \nexact locations of vital structures allows clinicians to plan safe \nzones during treatment to avoid potentially catastrophic \ncomplications. Proper planning is absolutely paramount to \nsuccess in any endeavor, and having a strong plan in place \nprior to the initiation of implant treatment is no exception.\nCone beam technology has ushered in a new era of accu-\nracy in treatment planning. Clinicians are no longer having \nto rely on “guesswork” by extrapolating anatomical measure-\nments from a distorted 2-D image. Templates may be made \nbased on these new 3-D images to assist clinicians during \ntough surgical cases, especially early on respective learning \ncurves. CBT is closer to becoming the standard of care across \nthe board.\nWith the combination of 3-D imaging and a thorough \nknowledge of the anatomic areas that are focused on in this \nchapter, a clinician can acquire a further degree of conidence \nthat the likelihood of complications has been reduced, which \nmakes the implant treatment process less stressful for both \npatient and provider."

The\nreferring clinician values this kind of report because the illustrations provided allow them\nto evaluate the severity of the conditions the radiologist has identified and can be used to\neducate the patient with regard to the radiographic findings.\nPatient referral to a physician for additional evaluation based on a radiology report does\nnot have clearly defined guidelines and clearly professional clinical judgment is the key,\ntaking into consideration and integrating clinical findings and patient symptoms. We as\nhealthcare providers have an underlying responsibility to refer patients for additional\nevaluation when considered appropriate; however, we cannot force our patients to go to\nphysicians if they do not choose to. As a result, documenting in the patient's chart that the\nradiology report indicated the presence of potential pathology in an area outside of our\nscope of practice and that the patient was requested to seek a more thorough examination\nfrom a physician regarding the condition is prudent and critical.\nFIG 4.52, cont’d (C) Hybrid medical style with illustrations. \nREFERENCES\n1.

    "content": "194\nDental Implant Intraoperative Complications\nRandolph R. Resnik\n5 \nThe surgical placement of dental implants, once a very special-\nized treatment modality, has become a very mainstream com-\nponent of contemporary dentistry. This has been made possible \nby advancements that have made dental implant procedures \nvery predictable with high success rates. Despite this level of \nsuccess, there still exist many potential complications that can \noccur at any phase of the implant surgical procedure. During \nany implant surgery the potential for a complication exists, \nranging from simple issues to situations that could potentially \nplace the patient at increased risk. The goal of this chapter is \nto provide the implant clinician with a knowledge base to \nproperly address many of the common and uncommon com-\nplications that may occur during the implant surgical phase.\nIMPLANT PLACEMENT: SURGICAL RELATED\nPLACEMENT OF IMPLANTS INTO SITES \nWITH PREEXISTING PATHOLOGY\nInfection or bacteria at or adjacent to a potential implant site \nis a signiicant source for future implant morbidity. Placement \nof an implant close to an infected site or into a previous extrac-\ntion site with bacterial contamination may lead to the loss of \nthe implant and/or loss of the adjacent tooth. Ayangco et al \nreported that teeth with failed endodontic lesions that were \nextracted, debrided, and suficiently healed, are at risk of pos-\nsible retrograde peri-implantitis after implant placement.1\nEtiology\nBacteria present at the time of surgery places the implant at \nrisk. Endodontically infected teeth have involved bacteria, \nwhich are most commonly Propionibacterium acnes, Staphy-\nlococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus intermedius, Wolinella \nrecta, and Porphyromonas and Prevotella spp.2 Bacteroides spp \nbacteria have been shown to inhabit natural tooth periapical \nlesions that are encapsulated in a polysaccharide that enhances \nits virulence and survival ability. Bacteroides forsythus has \nbeen shown to be present in asymptomatic periradicular end-\nodontic lesions and may survive encapsulated in bone even \nafter extraction and debridement.3\nPrevention\nThe surgical site should be evaluated radiographically prior to \nthe surgery for any possible apical pathology. The adjacent teeth \nshould be assessed for the presence of periodontal ligament \n(PDL) thickening or radiolucent areas that may impinge on the \narea of implant placement. Brisman et al reported that even \nasymptomatic endodontically treated teeth with normal radio-\ngraphic appearance could result in implant morbidity. They \nrelate the possibility of inadequate obturation with an incomplete \nseal on the tooth root that may contain bacteria, even when they \nare free of symptoms.4 Nelson and Thomas revealed in studies \nthat bacteria persist and are reactivated upon implant placement \neven after debridement of apical infection, complete extraction \nsocket healing, and alveolar bone remodeling.5 Kassolis et al \nreported that edentulous jaws will contain regions of bacterial \nbioilm and nonvital bone for over 1 year after extraction, and \nhealing may pose a signiicant risk for future implant failure.6\nTreatment\nEndodontic therapy, apical surgery, or extraction of the adja-\ncent tooth should be completed prior to placement of dental \nimplants in this area. Even in the absence of infection, extrac-\ntion sites should be thoroughly debrided and bleeding initi-\nated to reduce the bacteria count and increase bone growth \nfactors to the site. If granulation tissue remains, bacteria and \na resultant inlammatory response will persist. Special curettes \nmay be used to assist in the removal of the granulation tissue \nand small round burs (#2 or #4) can be used to perforate the \nalveolar walls to increase bleeding areas (Fig. 5.1).\nRETAINED ROOT TIPS IN IMPLANT SITE\nPlacement of dental implants into extraction sites that contain \nretained tooth roots may lead to inlammation and retro-\ngrade peri-implantitis. Unfortunately, in some cases, root tips \nare dificult to diagnosis preoperatively, the condition may go \nunnoticed until after implant placement.\nEtiology\nPlacement of dental implants, especially after immediate \nextraction, may lead to undiagnosed retained root tips at the \nsite of implantation. Gray et al, in an animal study, evaluated \nthe intentional placement of dental implants into tooth roots. \nHistologically, there was no inlammation, and in some of the \nspecimens a calciied material was deposited on the implants. \nBuser et al also supported the same indings in animal studies. \nHowever, implants should never be placed in contact with \ntooth structure because this may be a source of infection and \nplace the practitioner at risk for possible medicolegal issues."

As \na result, an incision made facial to the attached tissue may \ncause partial ischemia to some of the crestal tissue. In addi-\ntion, the incision in unkeratinized facial tissue also severs \nlarger blood vessels, which increases bleeding and decreases \nvision during surgery, while also potentially complicating \ninal suturing (Fig. 5.6).\nPrevention\nA thorough clinical examination to determine the amount of \nhost-attached tissue prior to surgery and the possible imple-\nmentation of tissue grafting prior to implant placement.\nTreatment\nFor implant sites intended for crown restorations, an evalua-\ntion of attached tissue should be done. If insuficient attached \ntissue is present, tissue augmentation procedures should be \ncompleted prior to implant placement. For larger edentulous \nsites, especially in the mandible, the incision may be modiied \nfor repositioning to a new, corrected site. The new osteotomy \nposition should be deepened so that subsequent end-cutting \ndrills will not reposition back into the original osteotomy site. \nHowever, when using the Lindemann bur, always use copious \namounts of saline because this bur will generate a signiicant \namount of trauma and heat to the bone7 (Fig. 5.5).\nLACK OF KERATINIZED TISSUE  \nAT SURGICAL SITE\nThe presence of keratinized tissue is a controversial subject \nin oral implantology.

Some reports indicate the lack \nof keratinized tissue may contribute to implant failure.8\nEtiology\nMobile, nonkeratinized mucosa has been shown to exhibit \ngreater probing depths, which has been conirmed histo-\nlogically.

Additionally, AlloDerm may be used as a \nmembrane and to increase the amount of attached tissue.\nBUR “STUCK” IN BONE DURING OSTEOTOMY\nEtiology\nOften in hard bone (≈D1–D2 bone), if the handpiece is \nstopped with the surgical drill in the bone, it may be dificult \nto remove out of the osteotomy. Attempting to remove the \nbur with the handpiece (either forward or reverse) will result \nin damage to the handpiece gears (Fig. 5.7).\nPrevention\nTo avoid this complication, in dense bone small (minimal) \nincrements of bone should be removed at a time. When per-\nforming the osteotomy, “bone dancing” should be performed, \nwhich will result in less stress to the bone and will allow for \nease of widening the osteotomy. Also, by using intermediate \nburs (more burs close in diameter), smaller amounts of bone \nare removed at a given time, decreasing the possibility of burs \nbeing lodged in the bone (“bur integration”).\nTreatment\nIf a bone drill becomes lodged in the bone during prepara-\ntion, the hand piece should not be wiggled back and forth \nto disengage the drill. This may increase the size of the \nbone preparation, cause injury and necrosis to the bone, or \nseparate the drill above or below the bone. Instead, the drill \nis disengaged from the handpiece and gently rotated counter-\nclockwise with forceps or rongeurs.\nOVERPREPARATION OF FINAL DRILL\nEtiology\nThe inal drill is the most critical surgical step in the osteot-\nomy preparation. The bone surrounding this drill will be in \ndirect contact with the implant. When the inal drill prepara-\ntion is not precise, the implant-bone region may be irregular \nwith gaps that may decrease initial stability and lead to early \nimplant failure. A decreased initial bone contact of the host \nbone and dental implant also decreases the percentage of new \nbone-implant contact formation (Fig. 5.8).\nPrevention\nA constant pressure and angulation is used with the inal drill \nto ensure that a precise, round osteotomy is prepared. The \nmost important factor is the use of the inal drill only once to \navoid over preparation, most importantly in less dense bone \n(≈D3–D4). In D4 bone the inal bur is often not used to"

In less \ndense bone, the buccal and lingual cortical plates can be \ndepressed to reduce movement of the implant. The implant \nshould then be evaluated for micromovement. If movement \nexists, the implant should be removed.\nRemove Implant, Deepen Osteotomy. The mobile implant \nmay be removed, and the osteotomy deepened so that rigid \nixation is obtained. However, care should be exercised to not \nallow encroachment on any vital structures (e.g., mandibular \ncanal) or compromise the prosthesis by increasing the crown-\nimplant ratio.\nRemove Implant, Place Wider Implant.

Allograft bone is not \npreferred because it tends to migrate easily after placement \nand is an added expense.\nLOSS OF FACIAL PLATE WHEN PLACING  \nAN IMPLANT\nWhen placing implants in bone that is compromised in width \n(∼division B), it is not uncommon to fracture or lose the \nfacial plate of supporting bone. This leads to a compromise \nin the healing of the implant and the longevity of the implant \nand prosthesis.\nEtiology\nIdeally, the width of bone needs to exceed 6.0 mm for place-\nment of a 4.0-mm diameter implant. When compromised \nwidth of bone exists, the trauma of the osteotomy or the \nplacement of the implant may fracture or “pop off” the buccal \nplate. This is most likely the result of the buccal plate being \nthinner than the lingual plate, which results in the facial plate \nbeing more susceptible to fracture (Fig. 5.10).\nPrevention\nDetermine the available bone prior to implant placement. If \nnonideal width of bone is present, site development, including \nFACIAL DEHISCENCE AFTER  \nIMPLANT PLACEMENT\nAfter implant placement, it is not uncommon to have facial \nplate dehiscence on the buccal aspect of the implant.

Thus, if \ninadequate bone is present, this may lead to future soft tissue \ncomplications and increased implant morbidity.\nEtiology\nBony defects at the crest after implant placement will usually \nresult in lack of available bone width at the ridge level \n(Fig. 5.9) (e.g., a division B ridge that is compromised in \nwidth ∼<6 mm).\nPrevention\nAll ridges should be modiied to obtain a division A bone \n(e.g., >6 mm width and >12 mm of bone height) before oste-\notomy initiation.

To combat this problem, Misch devel-\noped a different surgical protocol for the various bone quali-\nties in 1988. The implant design, surgical protocol, healing \ntimes, treatment plans, and progressive loading time spans \nare unique for each bone density type.\nEtiology\nFine trabecular (D4) bone has very little density with minimal \nto no cortical crestal bone. The most common locations for \nthis type of bone are the posterior molar region of the maxilla \nin a long-term edentulous patient, in an augmented ridge \n(grafted for height and width with particulate bone or sub-\nstitutes), or in a sinus graft.\nThe tactile sense during osteotomy preparation of this \nbone is similar to stiff, dense Styrofoam or soft balsa wood."

A hand wrench is contraindicated because it will widen \nthe osteotomy (i.e., make elliptical) and possibly result in a \nlack of rigid ixation of the implant.

Once inserted, the implant should \nnot be removed and reinserted.

The implant is countersunk in this bone if any \nrisk of loading is expected during healing (e.g., under a soft \ntissue–borne denture). Countersinking the implant below the \ncrest reduces the risk of micromovement during healing in \nthis very soft bone.

    "content": "204\nCHAPTER 5 Dental Implant Intraoperative Complications\nTreatment\nWhen a poorer type of bone exists, increased healing times and \nprogressive bone loading should be adhered to. Increased \nhealing time is indicated to allow for more bone to remodel at \nthe surface and to intensify its trabecular pattern. The addi-\ntional time also allows a more advanced bone mineralization \nand increased strength. Six or more months of undisturbed \nhealing is suggested. The compression technique for surgery \n(e.g., osteotomes), the extended healing time, and progressive \nbone loading protocol allow the remodeling of the poor quality \nbone into a more organized and load-bearing quality similar \nto D3 bone before the inal prosthetic loading of the implants.\nOVERHEATING THE BONE\nOne of the most common complications that has been associ-\nated with early implant failure and bone loss is overheating \nof the bone during osteotomy preparation. This usually is a \nresult of the surgical osteotomy protocol.\nEtiology\nThe amount of heat produced in the bone is directly related \nto the amount of bone removed by each drill.11 A 3-mm pilot \ndrill has been shown to generate greater heat than a 2-mm \npilot drill.12 As a result most manufacturers suggest the irst \ndrill be 2 mm or less in diameter. In a similar fashion, the \namount of heat generated by successive drills is also directly \nrelated to the increase in drill diameter. A 3-mm drill after a \n2-mm drill removes 0.5 mm of bone on each side of the drill. \nA 2.5-mm drill after a 2-mm drill removes only 0.25 mm of \nbone on each side of the osteotomy. The smaller incremental \ndrill size allows the surgeon to prepare the site faster, with less \npressure and less heat. In addition, when large increases in drill \ndiameter are used to prepare bone, the surgeon may inadver-\ntently change the angulation of the drill because the larger drill \nis removing a greater bone volume and the tactile sense is \ndecreased. As a result, an elliptical osteotomy may be prepared \nthat does not correspond accurately to the round implant \ndiameter. The gradual increase in osteotomy size also reduces \nthe drill chatter at the crestal opening, which can inadvertently \nchip away pieces of bone on the crest, where complete bony \ncontact is especially desired. The gradual increase in drill \ndiameter also keeps each drill sharper for a longer period, \nwhich also reduces the heat generated (Fig. 5.12).\nPrevention\nIntermediate Drills. Some manufacturers do not utilize an \nintermediate drill in their drilling protocol. However, a \ndecrease in the heat and trauma generated is found with the \nintermediate drill. Gradual increases in drill diameter reduce \nthe amount of pressure and heat transmitted to the bone, \nespecially in the presence of dense and thick cortical bone.\nCopious Amounts of Saline. Along with external irrigation \nfrom the surgical drills, increased irrigation may be obtained \nby using internal irrigation (through the surgical bur) or with \nsupplemental irrigation via a syringe.\nBone Dance. The bone-dancing technique was introduced \nby Misch in 1988 to reduce the amount of heat generation. \nWhen preparing the osteotomy, small increments of bone \nshould be removed, and by using the up-and-down motion \nof the drill, irrigation may enter the osteotomy site easier.\nUse of Sharp, New Drills. Drills that are dull will increase \nheat generation, causing the possibility of no bone integra-\ntion. On average, surgical drills should be replaced approxi-\nmately every 20 to 30 autoclave cycles.\nDrill Speed. Sharawy and Misch have shown that the drill \nspeed in hard, dense bone should be approximately 2000 to \n2500 RPM. Osteotomy preparation at higher speeds with \nsharp drills elicits less risk of osseous damage and a decreased \namount of devitalized zone adjacent to the implant.12 Yeniyol \net al have shown that drilling at very slow speeds results in a \nhigher degree of bone fragmentation.13\nSurgical Templates. Surgical templates often result in over-\nheating of the bone because of the decreased space between \nthe guide tubes in the template and the drill size. Ideally, the \ntemplate should be modiied to open up the facial aspect of \nthe template so supplemental irrigation may be utilized.\nTreatment\nIf known excess heat generation occurs during implant \nplacement, ideally the implant should be removed, regional \nacceleratory phenomenon (RAP) initiated, and the site \ngrafted for future implant placement. If bone width is avail-\nable after suficient RAP is completed, a wider implant may \nbe placed.\nIMPLANT PRESSURE NECROSIS\nA possible cause of early implant failure is pressure necrosis. \nOvercompression of the crestal bone has been shown to be a \ncontributing factor in implant failure.14 It is postulated that \nexcessive tightening of the implant creates compression forces \nwithin the crestal bone around the implant. This may impair \nthe microcirculation and lead to bone resorption.\nEtiology\nPressure necrosis from implant placement may increase the \ndevital zone of bone around the implant or even cause short-\nterm neurosensory impairment when the implant site is in \nthe vicinity of the mandibular canal. This most often occurs \nwhere there exists a cortical component of bone in the crestal \nregion (∼D1–D2 bone). If a crestal bone drill is not used in \nhigher bone density with a cortical component, excess stress \nwill be generated upon insertion of the implant, which will \nlead to a devitalized zone (Fig. 5.13).\nPrevention\nTorque. The implant should not be tightened into the oste-\notomy, such as a nut onto a bolt. A torque value up to 35 N/\ncm is considered safe with most threaded implant designs."

As a result, during bone remodeling the bone does not \nheal in its expanded position, instead returning to its initial \nnarrow dimension, and the implant fenestrates the labial \nplate. When bone expansion is performed at implant place-\nment, a stage II uncovery with relection of the facial soft \ntissue is advantageous to evaluate the facial plate.\nPrevention. To decrease the possibility of bone dehiscence \nafter bone spreading, the technique should be restricted to \ndivision A and B ridges.\nTreatment. When a dehiscence is observed, a barrier mem-\nbrane with layered graft approach is indicated to restore the \nfacial plate. Because the implant is integrated to the remain-\ning bone, the implant may be progressively loaded after a 3- \nto 4-month period, rather than waiting 6 to 9 months, as with \naugmentation by barrier grafts alone.\nPoor Position\nEtiology. The third complication of bone expansion is a \npoor inal implant position, usually more facial than ideal. \nThe thicker palatal cortical plate tends to push the osteotomes \nto the facial; if the implant surgeon is unaware of this mal-\npositioning, the end result will be an implant that is too facial \nand will be problematic esthetically and functionally.\nPrevention. Constant attention of angulation and modiica-\ntion of the palatal bone with side-cutting drills (Lindemann \ndrills) is necessary to prevent this problem.\nTreatment. The inal prosthesis should not be compromised \nfor the advantage of placing the implant during the surgery. \nBone augmentation and reentry 6 months postoperatively \noften improve the implant position and, as a result, the inal \nrestoration.\nINABILITY TO DETERMINE TRUE LOCATION \nOF MENTAL FORAMEN ON CBCT\nIf the true position of the mental foramen cannot be deter-\nmined from the CBCT, relection of the foramen is recom-\nmended to determine the exact position.\nEtiology\nAlthough rare, sometimes it is dificult to determine the exact \nlocation of the mental foramen or if an anterior loop exists \nfrom a CBCT. Because of the possible consequences of placing \nan implant too close to the mental foramen, care must be \nexercised to prevent impingement.\nCrestal Bone Bur. Because most implants have a wider crest \nmodule (wider diameter of the neck of implant in comparison \nto implant body), greater stress can be concentrated upon place-\nment in D1 and D2 types of bone. To decrease crestal pressure, \nthe implant may be placed to ideal position, then backed off \napproximately 1 mm to avoid pressure necrosis.\nTreatment\nIdeally, the thickness of crestal bone and bone quality type \nshould be ascertained prior to implant osteotomy prepara-\ntion. This is easily evaluated on a CBCT radiographic exami-\nnation. If a large cortical component of bone is present and \nthe implant placed is known to contain excess pressure, the \nimplant should be removed and the crestal bone modiied. \nThe implant should be then reinserted.\nBONE SPREADING COMPLICATIONS\nBone spreading has become a popular surgical technique to \nexpand the available bone width prior to implant placement. \nSince Tatum developed the bone spreading technique in the \nearly 1970s, the expansion technique has been primarily used \nin regions of division B bone to increase the bony width. \nHowever, the easiest edentulous ridges to expand are division \nA bone volume with associated D3 or D4 bone densities. The \nnarrower the bone, the greater the risk of fracture of the facial \nplate. The softer the trabecular bone quality, the lower the \nelastic modulus and the greater the viscoelastic nature of the \nridge. Therefore, the less dense the bone, the easier and more \npredictable the bone expansion. There exist three main \ncomplications that may occur during bone spreading.\nSplintering of Facial Plate\nEtiology. The most common complication of bone spread-\ning, especially in division B bone that is D2 quality, is splitting \nthe facial plate during the procedure. Once this occurs the \nsurgeon must decide whether to continue, place the implant, \nand perform a barrier membrane layered bone graft, or abort \nthe procedure and place only a bone graft (Fig. 5.14).\nPrevention. Make sure there exists suficient bone for bone \nspreading and good surgical technique. A common miscon-\nception is that division C minus width (C−w) ridges may be \nspread with simultaneous implant placement. This often \nresults in fracturing the facial plate. Bone spreading should \nbe restricted to division A and B ridges.\nTreatment. The implant may be inserted when the following \nfactors are positive: (1) the implant is rigid at the proper \ndepth, (2) the implant is in a favorable angulation, and \n(3) the facial plate is farther facial than the implant (it is \nfractured, but expanded). Under these conditions the barrier \nmembrane layered graft procedure will predictably restore \nthe facial bone, and the implant is not compromised. If one \nof these three factors is negative, it is more prudent to remove \nthe implant, harvest additional autograft, and perform the \nbone graft without the implant in situ."

The incisive canal has an average axis of \n70 degrees with a range of 57.0 to 89.5 degrees from the hori-\nzontal plane.16 This structure contains terminal branches of \nthe nasopalatine nerve, the greater palatine artery, and a short \nmucosal canal (i.e., Stensen duct). A vertical projection above \nthe incisive canal along the nasal loor is called the premaxillary \nwing. The nasal process of the premaxilla rises 2 to 3 mm \nabove the nasal loor. As a result, when 7 to 11 mm of bone is \npresent below the nasal loor, a large osteotome may create a \ngreenstick fracture in this process above the foramen and \npermit the placement of a 9- to 14-mm implant. The foramen \nis usually 4 to 6 mm in diameter at the crest and narrows down \nto 4 mm at the apex. Implants inserted at the same time as the \nsoft tissue is curetted are usually 5 to 6 mm in diameter.\nPrevention/Treatment\nThere exist many possible complications with incisive \nforamen implants.\nThe irst surgical complication of an incisive foramen \nimplant is the result of an implant that is too small for the \nforamen and not properly ixated. The implant may be inad-\nvertently pushed through the incisive canal and into the nares \nproper. Because the patient is lying on their back during the \nsurgery, the implant may fall back into the soft palate, then \ninto the trachea or esophagus. If the implant disappears from \nthe oral site, the patient’s head should be turned to the side \nimmediately, then down and forward. A nasal speculum and \ntissue forceps may then be used to recover the implant.\nPrevention\nA CBCT evaluation utilizing the cross-sectional and 3-D \nimages should be used to clearly identify the mental foramen. \nIn some cases, the brightness and contrast will need to be \naltered to depict the mental foramen.\nTreatment\nThe primary incision is extended anterior and posterior with \nreleases to minimize stretching of the tissue so the foramen may \nbe identiied. The location of the foramen is variable, depending \non age, ethnic background, amount of resorption, and skeletal \nrelationship. Initially, the periosteum is relected off the residual \ncrest, and a moist surgical sponge can be used to wipe the peri-\nosteum off the dense labial cortical plate to identify the superior \naspect of the foramen. After the superior aspect of the foramen \nis identiied, the tissue is relected anterior and posterior to \nconirm the exact location of the foramen (Fig. 5.15).\nINCISIVE FORAMEN IMPLANT  \nPLACEMENT COMPLICATIONS\nThe incisive foramen region, rather than a central incisor site, \nmay also be used to insert an endosteal implant, especially \nwhen an overdenture is the intended inal prosthesis.15 The \nincisive canal ranges in length from 4 to 26 mm and is directly \nrelated to the height of bone in the premaxilla.

Although this complication is very \nrare, it is possible. When relection of the palatal tissue off the \nincisive canal is associated with arterial bleeding, a blunt bone \ntap (mirror handle) may be placed over the canal and a mallet \nused to hit the instrument irmly, crushing the bone over the \nartery. After several minutes the procedure may continue, and \nthe implant insertion will obdurate the site and arrest the \nbleeding.\nThe short-term complication of an incisive foramen \nimplant is associated with enucleation of the soft tissue from \nthe foramen. Although the author has not witnessed this \ncomplication, neurologic impairment of the soft tissues in the \nanterior palate may exist. This may lead to paresthesia to the \nsoft tissue or a dysesthesia, with a report of a burning/painful \nsensation. It is logical to include this risk in an informed \nconsent. If it should occur, removal of the implant for dyses-\nthesia is warranted, whereas paresthesia of the palate most \nlikely is a condition the patient can tolerate without signii-\ncant issues. In many cases the patient will regain neurosen-\nsory feeling from collateral innervation.\nA long-term complication that has been observed twice \nby the author is the regeneration of the soft tissue in the \nincisive canal, resulting in bone loss around the implant. \nWhen the implant is removed and the soft tissue biopsied, \nnerve ibers can be seen reinvading the site. This most likely \noccurs because the implant was too small for the size of the \nforamen, and the soft tissue can reform around the implant. \nTreatment of this complication includes removing the \nimplant and, if necessary for the treatment plan, regrafting \nand/or reimplantation (Fig. 5.16).\nIMPLANT PLACEMENT IMPINGING ON  \nTHE NASOPALATINE CANAL\nThere exists a close anatomic relationship between the naso-\npalatine canal and the maxillary central incisor area. The ante-\nrior maxillary area has high esthetic importance, and ideal \nimplant placement is mandatory. The nasopalatine canal is \nlocated in the maxillary palatal midline, just posterior to the \ncentral incisor area. There is a funnel-shaped opening of the \ncanal into the oral cavity, which is known as the incisive \nforamen. The canal divides into two canaliculi towards the \nnasal cavity, and terminates at the nasal loor as the foramina \nof Stensen. The canal contains the nasopalatine (incisive) nerve \nand the terminal branch of the descending nasopalatine artery.\nEtiology\nWhen the maxillary teeth are lost, the buccal plate anterior \nto the canal will lose up to 60% of its width.

(Fig. 5.17).\nPrevention\nTo prevent implant placement into the nasopalatine area, \nCBCT imaging is recommended to determine the dimensions \nand morphology of the nasopalatine canal. The nasopalatine \ncanal has many variations ranging from one canal to various \ntypes of “Y” conigurations.\nTreatment\nWhen it is determined that an implant will impact upon the \nnasopalatine canal, alternative procedures must be consid-\nered. One such treatment is for enucleation of the canal, then \nbone grafting, with subsequent implant insertion. Alterna-\ntively, implants may be placed directly into the canal, usually \nfor overdenture treatment plans.18\nSTAGE II UNCOVERY SURGERY \nCOMPLICATIONS\nTISSUE PUNCH REDUCING AMOUNT OF \nATTACHED TISSUE\nA common technique to uncover or expose a healed implant \n(stage II surgery) is the use of a tissue punch that is slightly \nlarger than the implant placed. The tissue punch is preferred \nby many practitioners because it is quick and easy; however, \nit may be detrimental to the soft tissue health of the implant.\nEtiology\nA tissue punch is often used because it is fast and simple and \ncan be used without relecting the periosteum. However, this \nmay lead to potential prosthetic and long-term complications \nbecause it decreases the available amount of attached tissue. \nThe tissue punch is placed directly over the top of the implant \nand pressure is exerted to remove the tissue, exposing the \nimplant cover screw. However, the disadvantage of this tech-\nnique is the keratinized tissue that is sacriiced, which is often \nmuch larger than the diameter of the implant (Fig. 5.18).\nPrevention\nIf inadequate keratinized tissue is present (<3 mm), a tissue \npunch should not be used to uncover an implant. A tissue \npunch that is signiicantly larger than the implant crest module \nshould not be used because excessive tissue will be removed.\nTreatment\nIn cases of inadequate keratinized tissue, a slightly lingual inci-\nsion is made to create a soft tissue lap to uncover the implants. \nTissue grafting with autograft or AlloDerm may be used to \nincrease attached tissue volume surrounding the implant.\nBONY DEFECTS AT UNCOVERY\nOn occasion, a vertical or horizontal defect may be revealed \naround the uncovered implant at the second stage surgery. \nThis often presents a very dificult decision for the clinician \nas to the course of action."

This prevents soft tissue ingrowth into the \ndefect and provides an improved environment for the bone \ngraft healing time against the implant surface. In this scenario \nthe second stage uncovery is delayed for approximately 2 to \n4 months, depending on the size of the defect.\nWhen bone loss exposes the threads of the implant body, \nthe ability to reform bone in the defect when the implant is \nuncovered and loaded is reduced. When the implant has not \nbeen exposed before the uncovery procedure, the implant \nbody is usually not contaminated by microorganisms because \nit has been under soft tissue. The full-thickness relection of \nthe region has exposed areas of vital bone not involved in the \nimplant support. This bone may be harvested and packed \ninto the vertical defect (after the soft tissue in the defect has \nbeen thoroughly removed). The defect and surrounding area \nare overpacked. When the implant defect is larger than 3 mm, \nthe most predictable method to correct the condition is with \na particulate autologous bone graft covered by a resorbable \nmembrane (e.g., AlloDerm, Biomend), and the soft tissue is \nreapproximated over the membrane, bone graft, and implant \nfor an additional 8 to 12 weeks of healing. A vertical defect \ngreater than 3 mm is usually grafted unless it represents half \nor more of the total implant height, in which case the implant \nshould be removed.\nDefect less than 3.0 mm. When the vertical bone defect \naround an implant is less than 3 mm, the implant may be \nuncovered and used in the current condition for the prosthetic \nabutment. After the soft tissue is removed from a defect, the \nsurrounding bone is again evaluated. In the case of a vertical \nbone defect of less than 3 mm, there are three surgical options:\nFirst, an osteoplasty may eliminate the vertical defect when \nthe reduced bone-implant interface does not compromise the \nprosthetic support or esthetics. The permucosal abutment \n(PME) is placed at the same appointment (Fig. 5.20).\nA second method to correct a vertical defect less than \n3 mm is to curette the defect and overill the region with an \nautograft. The PME may be added at the same appointment \nand the tissue approximated around the site. When there is a \ndesire to have thicker soft tissue around the site, a barrier \nmembrane (e.g., AlloDerm) may be used over the implant \nsite and covered with soft tissue (Fig. 5.21).\nA third alternative to correct a vertical defect on the mesial \nand distal region is to drive a wedge into the bone several \nmillimeters away from the implant body. Tapping a wedge-\nshaped osteotome into the distal bone compresses vital bone \nup against the implant body. The wedge-shaped defect created \nin the ridge as a result of the osteotome is several millimeters \naway from the implant and is surrounded by bone; this defect \nwill heal without consequence. A facial or lingual vertical \ndefect may be corrected by taking a blunt instrument with a \nmallet and compressing the facial or lingual bone against the \nimplant body. This technique also places live, viable bone \n(autogenous) adjacent to the implant body. The PME is \nplaced at this appointment.\nHorizontal Defects\nTreatment. A horizontal bony defect of bone around the \nimplant body may also be treated in several ways.\nGreater than one-half length. When horizontal bone loss \naround an implant is more than half of the implant body, the \nimplant should be surgically removed and the site grafted at \nthe uncovery appointment for future implant placement.\nLess than one-half length. The most predictable method \nto treat horizontal bone loss that is less than 50% of the \nimplant body is to reduce the soft tissue thickness to decrease \nthe probing depth around the implant. The soft tissue may \nbe apically repositioned, exposing a portion of the implant \nbody into the oral cavity. If threads or a rough surface are \npresent above the bone, an aluminum oxide (“white”) stone \nand rubber wheel are used under copious irrigation to smooth \nthe region and limit plaque accumulation. A cement-retained \nprosthesis on an implant with horizontal bone loss may be \nplaced on the implant body in esthetic regions.\nAnother option to address horizontal bone loss is to grow \nbone above the defect, and this method is used when the inal \nprosthesis is a ixed-prosthesis 1 (FP-1) or additional bone-\nimplant interface is required to withstand the forces exerted"

Soft tissue greater than 4 mm in thickness will \nresult in a less-than-ideal pocket depth around the implant.19,20\nEtiology\nIt is not uncommon when implants are placed in edentulous \nridges to have excessive tissue thickness before and after \nimplant surgery. This is most common in the posterior \nmaxilla and patients with a thick biotype (Fig. 5.22).\nPrevention\nPreoperative assessment of tissue should be conducted or \nthe tissue maybe thinned out at the implant placement \nappointment.\nTreatment\nThe tissue is relieved from the periosteal surface, especially in \nthe labial lap, until it is less than 3 mm thick. If abundant \nattached tissue is present in the palatal region of the maxillary \nimplants, a gingivoplasty may be performed.\nWhen the tissue requires apical repositioning or when it \nis 3 to 4 mm thick and may grow over the healing abutment, \nthe suture groove may be used. A suture is placed next to the \nhealing abutment (PME) and is tied to lower the tissue level. \nTissue forceps lift the suture from the incision line, and the \nsuture is then rotated to form a loop. The loop is placed over \nthe enlarged healing abutment and into the suture groove or \nunder the healing cap. The suture may then be tied, securing \nthe tissue at the height of the suture groove. A similar tech-\nnique is used on the other side of the healing abutment. These \ntwo sutures (one on each side) hold the tissue at the level of \nthe suture groove and prevent it from lifting up and over the \nhealing cap during soft tissue healing (Fig. 5.23).\nLOSS OF PAPILLA AFTER UNCOVERY  \n(SPLIT-FINGER TECHNIQUE)\nWhen the implant-bone interface is acceptable, the exposure \nof the implant body should be accomplished with the soft \ntissue inal architecture in mind.

In addition, bone is often only 60% mineral-\nized at stage II uncovery after the surgical trauma from stage I \nsurgery. According to computer densitometry reports, bone \nmay be more dense and the bone interface stronger on the day \nof surgery, compared with the stage II uncovery date.23,24 It \ntakes 52 weeks after initial surgery for bone to be completely \nmineralized. The mineralization of bone is related to its \nstrength. Using RTT at stage II uncovery evaluates the interface \nwhen it is weak and more at risk to fracture from overload. In \naddition, at 4 months the bone is often still histologically \nwoven bone rather than lamellar bone. Woven bone is unor-\nganized and weaker than the load-bearing lamellar bone, \nwhich is more desirable at the implant interface. An RTT at \nuncovery does not permit this improved interface to develop \nbefore testing. RTT of implants too early in the healing process \n(relative to bone density) is more likely to lead to the removal \nof implants that would otherwise be integrated.\nPrevention\nIn the author’s opinion RTT presents too many subjective \nvariables. Misjudgment can damage the bone-implant inter-\nface and prolong treatment and increase costs associated with \nthe extra reparative treatment. The desire for objective stan-\ndards for clinical veriication of osteointegration is under-\nstandable. The most common methods of clinical veriication \nused today, radiographs and manual mobility testing, have an \nadmittedly subjective component. However, they do not place \nthe implant at risk and have stood the test of time.\nTreatment\nIt is recommended not to utilize a reverse torque test in the \nevaluation of the dental implant integration.\nANESTHESIA/PLATELET-RICH FIBRIN \nCOMPLICATIONS\nINABILITY TO OBTAIN MANDIBULAR BLOCK\nWith the placement of implants in the mandible, profound \nanesthesia is a crucial component of surgical success. In eden-\ntulous mandibles or patients being treated with sedation, this \nmay be dificult, and alternative anesthesia techniques are \nwarranted. The Misch Implant Institute has recommended \nfor years a rarely used technique in obtaining profound anes-\nthesia in the mandible, the Akinosi technique.\nEtiology\nWith edentulous patients the Akinosi technique is preferred \nbecause traditional techniques (Halsted block) require the \nuse of reference points (occlusal plane), which are not present \nin edentulous patients. Additionally, many dental implant \npatients are sedated, which results in dificulty for the patient \nto open fully for the injection.\nPrevention\nThe implant clinician must understand and utilize profound, \nalternative anesthesia techniques such as the Akinosi technique.\nto increase the amount of papilla height around the \nimplant body.\nTreatment\nMaintain Papilla. An incision is made in the gingival sulci of \nthe adjacent teeth. The incision is started at the distolingual \nline angle of the adjacent teeth and forms a loop at the facial \nemergence location of the implant crown. This creates two \n“ingers” at least 2 mm in width adjacent to each natural tooth. \nOnce elevated, these two facial ingers will become the facial \naspects of the interdental papillae. A central palatally sup-\nported inger is also created. The tissues are then elevated, and \nthe implant cover screw is exposed and replaced with an abut-\nment. The palatal inger may then be split into two segments \n(i.e., the split-inger approach). Each segment is rotated to the \ninterproximal region to support the elevated facial ingers. A \n4-0 or 5-0 modiied mattress suture positions the papillae in \nthe proper location, next to a transitional crown (Fig. 5.24).\nIncrease Papilla Height. When additional height is required, \nthe split-inger technique may be used in conjunction with a \nconnective tissue graft or AlloDerm to further augment the \ntissue height. This procedure may also be performed at inser-\ntion surgery, when a one-stage approach is desired.\nOnce the soft tissues are subtracted or added to obtain the \ndesired emergence contour, the surgeon has basically two \noptions to maintain this region. The irst option is that a PME \nabutment may be inserted. Its size and shape should be \nsmaller than the cervical contour of the inal crown and \nextend through the tissue 1 to 2 mm. The emergence of the \nPME abutment will develop the initial soft tissue form. A \nwide-proile PME abutment should not be used because it \nmay cause gingival shrinkage and limit the restoring dentist’s \nability to shape it into its ideal form. A transitional prosthesis \nis recontoured to it over the healing cap for the next few \nweeks, until the patient is seen for the irst prosthetic appoint-\nment. The soft tissue heals and is allowed to contour to the \nhealing abutment or permucosal device. Usually, 4 to 6 weeks \nis needed for ideal tissue maturation.\nREVERSE TORQUE TESTING COMPLICATIONS\nReverse torque testing (RTT), used as veriication for rigid ixa-\ntion, involves placing a deined reverse torque (counterclock-\nwise) to the implant (via mount) at stage II uncovery surgery. \nThe level of applied torque ranges from 10 to 20 N/cm. Implants \nfailing such testing are presumed to be nonintegrated, likely to \nbecome early loading failures, and are not recommended for \nuse as prosthetic abutments. Reports in the literature have sug-\ngested RTT at stage II surgery or to assess an implant suitability \nfor immediate loading.22 Two alleged advantages are its use as a \nbiomechanical measure of initial stability and its use as a deini-\ntive veriication of initial osteointegration.\nEtiology\nThe RTT is suggested to be most beneicial in less dense bone, \nyet bone of this density is most at risk of failure during the"

The needle \npenetrates approximately half its length (25 to 30 mm) before \naspiration and injection of anesthetic. For this technique, no \nbony landmark is used. The Akinosi block is usually less painful \nfor the patient because the anesthetic luid is injected into the \ntop of the pterygoid triangular space, which has more room for \nthe solution. In addition, the top of this triangular space has \nfewer muscle ibers in the pathway of the injection compared \nto the penetration site of the Halsted block and is associated \nwith less discomfort (Fig. 5.25).\nINADEQUATE BLOOD SPIN FOR  \nPLATELET-RICH FIBRIN\nPlatelet-rich ibrin (PRF), described by Choukran et al, has \nbecome very popular in the ield of implant dentistry.25 The \nobtained ibrin platelet matrix contains numerous growth \nfactors that are responsible for cell mitosis, increasing colla-\ngen production, recruiting cells to the injury site, initiating \nangiogenesis, and inducing cell differentiation. After drawing \nthe patient’s blood, a centrifuge process allows the formation \nof a ibrin mesh that is enriched with platelets and growth \nfactors. This natural ibrin matrix concentrates platelets and \ngrowth factors and allows for enhanced hard and soft tissue \nhealing. Within the tube the ibrin clot is formed in the \nmiddle layer. The upper layer contains the acellular plasma, \nand the bottom part contains red corpuscles.\nEtiology\nWhen the centrifuge process does not work properly, a dis-\ntinct middle layer (PRF) will not be present. This may happen \nbecause of numerous possibilities including:\n• Delay in centrifuging blood (the longer the delay, the \nless clot formed)\n• Insuficient time in the centrifuge\n• Inadequate centrifuge RPM (3000 rpm)\n• Test tube contains anticoagulant (e.g., chloral hydrate)\nPrevention\nThe blood sample should be immediately placed in the cen-\ntrifuge without delay and spun for a minimum of 12 minutes.\nTreatment\nIf the ibrin clot is not present, a new blood sample should \nbe obtained and the process is repeated (Fig. 5.26).\nDIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING BLOOD SAMPLE \nFOR PRF PROCESS\nA failed blood draw is most commonly caused by improper \nneedle position. Ideally, with the use of a vacutainer, after \npenetration into the vein, negative pressure allows for the \nrapid illing of the sample tube.\nEtiology\nIf free low of the blood into the tube is not present, it is most \ncommonly due to one of the following improper needle"

    "content": "223\nCHAPTER 5 Dental Implant Intraoperative Complications\nAIR EMPHYSEMA\nSubcutaneous air emphysema can lead to many devastating \ncomplications during and after dental implant surgery. Early \nrecognition and management of this condition is crucial to \npreventing progression of the problem. As the air accumu-\nlates subcutaneously, dissection occurs along the connective \ntissue that joins the adjacent muscle planes. Via the fascial \nspaces, air from the oral cavity may extend into the medias-\ntinum space, where it may communicate with parapharyn-\ngeal and retropharyngeal spaces, which lead to airway \ncompromise. From the retropharyngeal space, air may lead \ninto the pleural space and pericardium, which could result in \nheart and lung failure.\nEtiology\nBecause of the attachment apparatus difference between \nimplants and teeth, air extruded into the sulcular area around \nimplants may lead to air emphysema. The two most common \nways for this to occur is the use of an air-driven handpiece or \nan air-water syringe in which air is forced into the sulcular \narea. Symptoms will include swelling that increases over \ntime with a “crackling” feeling with pain. Crepitus to palpa-\ntion will conirm the diagnosis of air emphysema. The patient \nwill usually be apprehensive with a feeling of dificulty in \nbreathing.\nPrevention\nWhen placing implants, modifying abutments with the \nmouth, or removing bone around an implant body, an elec-\ntric handpiece should always be used (i.e., never use a air-\ndriven handpiece). Additionally, an air-water syringe should \nnever be used to place air into the sulcular area parallel to the \nlong axis of the implant.\nTreatment\nUsually symptoms arise immediately; however, cases have \nbeen described that have occurred minutes to hours after a \nprocedure. Patients with signiicant emphysema should be \nmonitored closely prior to discharge for respiratory or cardiac \ndistress. Treatment should include supportive therapy with \nheat and analgesics. Antibiotic therapy should always be given \nbecause infection may result from bacteria being induced \ninto the fascial spaces with resultant cellulitis or necrotizing \nfascitis. Resolution usually occurs in 4 to 7 days with minimal \nmorbidity. In isolated cases, exploratory surgery, emergency \ntracheotomy, and the placement of chest tubes have been \nreported (Fig. 5.30).26\nSOFT/HARD TISSUE COMPLICATIONS\nElectric Handpieces\nElectric handpieces, the most common type of handpieces used \nin implant dentistry today, have a tendency to overheat, which \nmay result in signiicant soft tissue complications. In 2007 and \n2010, the FDA released warnings to health professionals \nconcerning possible serious burns related to electric dental \nhandpieces. The FDA has requested manufacturers to decrease \nthese issues by design modiication, overheating alarms, warning \nlabels, and clinician training to avoid overheating.\nEtiology. Because electric handpieces have insulated hous-\nings, the clinician may not be aware of the extent of the heat \ngenerated in the handpiece. Compounding the problem is \nthat the patient may be anesthetized and unaware of the \nthermal injury. Injuries have been reported ranging from irst- \nto third-degree burns and may require reconstructive surgery. \nUnlike conventional air-driven handpieces that decrease efi-\nciency when overworked, electric handpieces will maintain \nhigher eficiency, thus generating a greater amount of heat.\nPrevention. Awareness is most crucial for avoiding this com-\nplication. The clinician should be conscious of the possibility of \nhandpiece overheating, take frequent breaks during treatment, \nand check continuously for the implant motor becoming hot \nduring treatment. The electric handpieces should have routine \nmaintenance according to manufacturer’s recommendations.\nTreatment. If a burn occurs, treatment will vary depending \non the severity usually. Treatments range from OTC ointment \nto a physician referral. For severe burns, systemic antibiotics \nare warranted. If the burn does not penetrate the vermillion \nborder, healing will usually result without a defect (Fig. 5.31).\nMonopolar Electrosurgery Units\nMonopolar electrosurgical units are a common soft tissue \nmodality used in dentistry today. However, in implant den-\ntistry, when these units are used around dental implants, \nsigniicant complications may arise. Monopolar electrocau-\ntery should never be used in the proximity of a dental implant \nor implant prosthesis.\nEtiology. Electrosurgery is deined as the controlled passage \nof high-frequency waveforms, or currents, for the purpose of \naltering the surrounding soft tissue. The action of monopolar \nelectrocautery is cutting the tissue by means of advancing \nspark with a grounded patient. This results in sparking, \ncurrent spread, and thermal damage in the tissues because of \nthe generation of heat.\nPrevention. In implant dentistry, monopolar electrosurgery \nunits are contraindicated. The monopolar electrodes cannot \ncontact an implant or electrical shock osteoradionecrosis and \npossible implant loss may result (Fig. 5.32). However, bipolar \nelectrosurgical units have been shown to be effective around \ndental implants. Bipolar electrocautery utilizes molecular reso-\nnance with a sine-wave current that prevents sparking and \nthermal damage. These types of units may be used continu-\nously because they produce progressive coagulation rather \nthan a single high-output discharge, thus creating no spark.27\nTreatment. Treatment is usually palliative in nature as elec-\ntrosurgery damage is usually irreversible."

Additionally, the anatomy of the sublingual area must \nbe understood. The sublingual gland is positioned adjacent \nto the lingual cortex and seated below the mylohyoid muscle. \nThe submandibular duct is positioned inferior and medial to \nthe sublingual gland. The lingual nerve will cross the sub-\nmandibular duct from medial to lateral and then cross back \nat the irst premolar area, where it branches into the tongue \nmusculature.\nTreatment\nTreatment should include referral to an oral and maxillofacial \nsurgeon, which usually involves the complete removal of the \nsublingual gland. In some cases, where the ranulas are very \nsmall and asymptomatic, no surgery may be indicated or \nmarsupialization to reestablish connection with the oral \ncavity (Fig. 5.33).28\nANESTHETIC TOXICITY\nA serious complication, local anesthetic overdosage is of great \nconcern in implant dentistry. Because many implant-related \nsurgeries are of longer duration, a greater amount of anes-\nthetic is often administered. Special attention must be taken \nduring implant surgery as to the number of cartridges and \ntype of anesthetic used during a procedure.\nEtiology\nThe maximum number of cartridges that can be adminis-\ntered safely to a patient is time dependent. The elimination \nhalf-life is not indicative of anesthetic duration; however, it \nmay be used as a guide for repeated anesthetic administration \nduring a lengthy procedure. After one half-life, as much as \n50% of the permissible dose can be administered with rea-\nsonable safety if liver function is normal. Special care must \nbe given to the use of combination local anesthetics. In \nimplant dentistry, it is common to use two amide anesthetics \ntogether—lidocaine and bupivacaine. Although acceptable, \ntotal doses should not exceed combined maximum recom-\nmended doses. Calculations should factor in the total dose of \nthe combination and whether suficient time has elapsed for \nelimination of the initial dose.29\nTreatment\nMost amide anesthetics (except for articaine) are metabolized \nby the liver by a microsomal enzyme system. Special attention \nshould be given to patients with decreased liver function (e.g., \nas a result of chronic alcoholism, hepatitis), especially elderly \npatients. The half-life of lidocaine has been shown to be \ngreater than 2.5 times the normal values in patients with \nhepatic disease.30 Special attention must be given to the \namount of anesthetic used, and concern for reinjection (i.e., \namount of anesthetic administered after initial block) must \nbe strictly evaluated in these patients. In addition to the liver, \nEtiology\nThe proximity of the sublingual gland to the lingual cortical \nplate of the mandible makes it susceptible to injury. If the \ngland is traumatized, a ranula may result. Trauma usually \noccurs from improper angulation during dental implant \nsurgery, which perforates the lingual cortex and causes \ndamage to the sublingual gland. Additionally, the gland may \nbe injured during aggressive relection and retraction when \nworking in the sublingual area.\nFIG 5.31 Soft tissue burns.

Oxidizer (e.g., oxygen, nitrous oxide)\nThe most signiicant risk for a dental surgical ire occurs \nwhen laser or electrocautery units are use in an oxygen-rich \nenvironment such as when supplemental oxygen is adminis-\ntered via a nasal cannula. The spark from the electrocautery \nunit or laser in the presence of oxygen or highly inlammable \nanesthetic gases may cause the explosion or surgical ire.32\nPrevention\nThe FDA recommends the following steps to prevent dental \nsurgical ires33:\n1. Determine which procedures carry high risk, which will \ninclude any procedure requiring the use of supplemental \noxygen and the operation of an ignition source near the \noxygen.\n2. Use supplemental oxygen safely. Deliver the minimum \nconcentration of oxygen needed to maintain adequate \noxygen saturation for your patient. If any type of ignition \nsource is required, oxygen should be decreased or shut off.\n3. Use alcohol-based (lammable) skin preparation agents \nsafely. Prevent alcohol-based antiseptics from pooling in \nthe surgical area (mouth). Remove alcohol-soaked materi-\nals from the prep area, such as 4 × 4 gauze that is used for \nintra or extra oral scrub. Allow adequate time for the \nalcohol-based antiseptic to dry.\n4. Use surgical equipment safely and consider alternatives to \nusing an ignition source for dental implant surgery. If an \nignition source must be used, know that it is safer to do \nso after allowing time for the oxygen concentration to \ndecrease. It may take several minutes for a reduction of \noxygen concentration in the area even after stopping the \ngas or lowering its concentration.\n5. Understand that surgical drapes and other fuel sources \n(e.g., patient napkins, surgical table covers) can ignite \neasily and burn in an oxygen-enriched environment, even \nif the products are described as “lame-resistant.”\nTreatment\nIn case of an airway ire, immediately halt the procedure and \nstop the low of any gases (e.g., oxygen) and ventilate the \noperatory. Remove any lammable material such as gauze and \npatient drapes. Saline may be used to extinguish an airway \nire. Assess the patient; medical assistance should be sum-\nmoned in most cases (Boxes 5.2 and 5.3).\nORAL/CONSCIOUS SEDATION TOXICITY\nIt has been estimated that as many as 75% of adults in the \nUnited States have some degree of dental fear, ranging from \nmild to severe,34 and that approximately 5% to 10% avoid \ndental care because of anxiety.35 In implant dentistry the use \nof conscious sedation is a valuable adjunct. The American \nDental Association deines conscious sedation as a minimally \ndepressed level of consciousness that retains the patient’s \nability to independently and continuously maintain an airway \nand respond appropriately to physical stimulation or verbal \ncommand and that is produced by a pharmacologic or non-\npharmacologic method or combination thereof.36 Several"

Table 5.2 lists the most commonly used oral \nand intravenous sedative agents.\nBenzodiazepines\nEtiology. Benzodiazepines are the most effective drugs avail-\nable for dental-related anxiety used in private practice today. \nBenzodiazepines mainly produce anxiolysis and anterograde \namnesia, which are extremely useful for patients undergoing \nconscious sedation for dental implant procedures. The exact \nmechanism is not known; however, benzodiazepines are \nthought to have an effect on the limbic system and the thala-\nmus, which are involved with emotions and behavior.37 \nUnfortunately, in the ield of sedation dentistry, the use of \noral sedative agents is often misused, which may lead to sig-\nniicant complications.\nTriazolam. One of the most common benzodiazepines \nused today in implant dentistry is triazolam (Halcion), which \nis an orally administered and short-term hypnotic drug. In \naddition to its hypnotic properties, triazolam also has the \nadvantages of anterograde amnesia, anxiolytic, sedative, and \nanticonvulsant properties. When given orally, this drug is fast \nacting with short duration and has been shown to be safe and \neffective for dental procedures. Studies have shown that tri-\nazolam given in doses of 0.25 to 0.5 mg does not produce \nadverse effects in respiration, heart rate, or arterial pressure.37\nDiazepam. Diazepam (Valium) is a long-acting drug that \nfor years has been the most commonly used form of benzo-\ndiazepine. Basically, in low doses, diazepam reduces anxiety \nwithout sedation and in high doses it acts as a sedative and \npromotes sleep. Diazepam has anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, \nsedative, hypnotic, skeletal muscle relaxant, and amnestic \nproperties. It is mainly used in dentistry to reduce tension \nand anxiety and induce retrograde amnesia. When given \norally, it is rapidly absorbed and has a fast onset of action \nwithin 60 minutes. The bioavailability after oral administra-\ntion is 100%, and the peak plasma levels occur between 30 \nminutes and 90 minutes after administration. Diazepam has \nthe disadvantage of pharmacologically active metabolites, \nwhich may interact with other medications. Because of the \nactive metabolites, diazepam has a biphasic half-life of about \n1 to 2 days and 2 to 7 days for the active metabolite desmeth-\nyldiazepam, which results in prolonged action, causing \ndrowsiness and lethargy for up to 48 hours.38\nAdditional Conscious Sedation Medications\nFentanyl is a synthetic opioid agonist narcotic that produces \nanalgesia, drowsiness, sedation, and euphoria, but no amnesia. \nAll opioid agonists produce dose-dependent depression of \nventilation. Respiratory depression is a result of a decreased \nresponse of the ventilatory centers to carbon dioxide. For this \nreason, care should be taken when administering opioid ago-\nnists, especially in combination with other sedatives. Nausea \nand vomiting are another undesirable effect of opioid ago-\nnists. Opioid-induced nausea and vomiting are caused by \ndirect stimulation of dopamine receptors in the chemorecep-\ntor trigger zone in the fourth loor of the fourth ventricle."

The peak effect is seen at 6 to 10 \nminutes. The recommended dose for adults is 200 mg every \n1 to 2 minutes until the effect is seen, to a maximum of 3 mg \nper hour. It is available as a clear, colorless solution for intra-\nvenous injection, containing 500 mg in 5 mL. It is hepatically \nmetabolized to inactive compounds, which are excreted in the \nurine.40 Many benzodiazepines have longer half-lives than \nlumazenil. Repeated doses of lumazenil may be required to \nprevent recurrent symptoms of overdosage after the initial \ndose of lumazenil wears off (Fig. 5.34). Reversal drug of \nchoice is naloxone HCl (Narcan 0.4 mg/ml). The initial nal-\noxone dose is 0.4 mg that can be repeated every 2 to 3 minutes \ndepending on the patient’s respiratory status. The duration \nof action of naloxone is shorter than most opioids, so the \npatient should be closely monitored for recurrence of opioid \ntoxicity.\nThere exists numerous routes of pharmacologic admin-\nistration for medical emergency episodes. The most ideal \nsite for administration is intravenous (IV) because this \nmethod has direct access to the bloodstream. In most \nnonsedation cases, this is route is impractical. Another \noption for the implant clinician for the administration of \nan injectable emergency drug is the sublingual approach. \nThis method allows for fast, easy access for the administra-\ntion below the tongue, which allows for the medication to \ndiffuse into the bloodstream. The insertion point is the \nsublingual midline to avoid damage to the salivary ducts.\nThe deltoid approach (intramuscular) utilizes the deltoid \nmuscle site (upper arm), which is recommended for injec-\ntions of smaller volume. To locate this administration site, \nthe acromian process is palpated as the superior landmark \nPropofol (Diprivan) is an intravenous sedative-hypnotic \nagent commercially introduced in the United States in 1989 \nby Zeneca Pharmaceuticals. It was the irst of a new class of \nintravenous anesthetic agents: the alkylphenols. Propofol is \nan ideal sedative anesthetic for dentistry because it is fast-\nacting and possesses a short half-life. The elimination half-life \nof propofol has been estimated to be between 2 and 24 hours. \nHowever, its duration of clinical effect is much shorter \nbecause propofol is rapidly distributed into peripheral tissues. \nBecause of its pronounced respiratory depressant effect and \nits narrow therapeutic range, propofol should be adminis-\ntered only by individuals trained in airway management. \nThere is no reversal agent at this time for Propofol.\nPrevention\nThe irst key to prevention is obtaining adequate training in \nthe use of conscious sedation. The implant dentist must \nacquire sedation skills from both a theoretical and a practical \nstandpoint. The second key to prevention is preparedness, \nwhich irst includes an up-to-date emergency kit containing \nemergency drugs (including reversal agents) and an airway kit \nthat enables them to deliver oxygen under positive pressure. \nOxygen is the irst line of defense in a sedation emergency, and \nproper administration must be understood. The ofice should \nhave an emergency plan in place. The third key of prevention \nis the use of sedative medications within maximum doses \nwith strict protocol to patient monitoring.39\nTreatment\nBesides maintaining the patient’s airway and an emergency \nprotocol, implant dentists must have ideal reversal agents \nfor benzodiazepines. Flumazenil (Anexate, Lanexat, Mazicon, \nRomazicon) is a benzodiazepine antagonist used as a reversal \nagent for the treatment of benzodiazepine overdose. It reverses \nFIG 5.34 Reversal agents.
