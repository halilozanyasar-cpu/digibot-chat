Resnik\n16 \nDental implants have been shown to have excellent clinical \nsurvival; however, many longitudinal studies have shown an \nincreased incidence of biologic and technical complications \nwhen compared with tooth-borne full coverage restorations.1 \nAs dental implants are becoming more and more popular, the \nimplant clinician must be cognizant of potential prosthetic \ncomplications that may ensue. In this chapter, a wide range \nof ixed prosthetic complications will be discussed. These \ninclude biomechanical force–related complications, prosthe-\nsis complications, intraoperative complications, esthetic com-\nplications, and postoperative complications. By having an \nunderstanding of the guidelines established to prevent, iden-\ntify, and treat these numerous ixed prosthetic complications, \nan implant dentist can signiicantly improve clinical out-\ncomes while reducing the overall stresses of daily practice life.\nBIOMECHANICS: FORCE-RELATED ISSUES\nBiomechanical stress, which is responsible for a majority of \ndental implant complications, most commonly occurs from \nocclusal function. Most biomechanical complications do not \noccur as a result of a single force event because they typically \ndevelop over time. This repetitive force, which is applied to the \nvarious dental materials that make up the prosthesis, follows a \nfatigue curve. The fatigue curve is directly related to the number \nof cycles and the intensity of the force.2 When lower-force \nmagnitudes repeatedly contact an object, the force can eventu-\nally exceed the endurance limit and fracture of the material will \nresult (Fig. 16.1). For example, a wire coat hanger that is bent \ndoes not break the irst time, but repeated bends will fracture \nthe material—not because the last bend was more forceful but \nbecause of the resultant fatigue. This same principle applies to \ndental implants and is why the most common cause of implant \nand prosthesis component complications are related to biome-\nchanical conditions that give rise to fatigue.3\nSCREW LOOSENING\nAbutment screw loosening has been shown to be associated \nwith an overall average of 6% of implant prostheses fabri-\ncated.3 Screw loosening is the most common implant pros-\nthetic complication, accounting for approximately 33% of \nall postimplant prosthodontic complications.4 More recent \nstudies indicate this complication occurs in approximately \n8% of single crowns, 5% of multiple-unit ixed prostheses, \nand 3% of implant overdentures. De Boever has shown that \n12% of prostheses exhibit loosening within 3 years,5 while \nChaar has shown an incidence of 4.3% within 5 years and \napproximately 10% long term (5–10 years).6\nScrew loosening may cause considerable complications. A \nloose screw may contribute to crestal bone loss because bacte-\nria are able to colonize and harbor in the open interface. When \nan abutment screw becomes loose on a cemented crown, the \ncrown may need to be cut off the abutment to gain access to \nthe abutment screw, which results in patient disappointment \nand unproductive clinician time. If a loose abutment screw is \nnot treated appropriately, fracture of the prosthesis, implant \ncomponents, or the implant body may occur.\nEtiology\nExternal Force Factors (Box 16.1). External forces that act on \na screw joint greatly increase the risk of screw loosening. These \nforces may be called joint-separating forces when related to \nscrew loosening; however, they are the same forces that are risk \nfactors for implant failure, crestal bone loss, and component \nfracture. When the external joint-separating forces are greater \nthan the force holding the screws together (called clamping \nforces), the screw will become loose. The external forces from \nparafunction, crown height, masticatory dynamics, position in \nthe dental arch, and opposing dentition are factors that can \ndramatically increase the stress to the implant and the screw \njoint. In addition, conditions that magnify or increase these \nfactors are cantilevers, angled loads, and poor occlusal designs.\nExternal forces applied to the joint system are important \nto account for when the aim is to decrease the incidence of \nscrew loosening. The endurance limit of a material is the \namount of force required to fracture the object when enough \ncycles are applied. The greater the force, the fewer cycles \nrequired before fracture occurs. It is the combination and \nrelationship of both the amount of force and the number of \ncycles that is the cause of the screw loosening complication.\nCantilevers/Increased Crown Height Space. One of the \nmost common etiologic factors that results in screw loosen-\ning is excessive continuous occlusal forces. The most common \nexample occurs in prostheses with improper occlusal con-\ntacts. The greater the stress applied to the prostheses, the \ngreater the risk of abutment screw loosening. A nonideal \nprosthetic design may potentiate the force applied. Cantile-\nvers increase the risk of screw loosening because they increase"

For example, cantilevers on prostheses lead \nto uneven occlusal loads. Uneven occlusal loads cause repeated \ncycles of compression and then tension and shear of implant \ncomponents. Screws are especially vulnerable to tensile and \nshear forces. Both of these are dramatically increased with \ncantilever forces or angled loads. Because the screw is an \ninclined plane, the continued vibration causes it to unthread. \nThe greater the range of external forces, the fewer the number \nof cycles necessary before screw loosening.\nWhen an increased crown height space exists (poor crown-\nimplant ratio), there is a resultant greater force applied to the \nscrew. This usually results in a greater risk of screw loosening \n(or fracture). Boggan et al demonstrated that the force that \nis applied to the screw is directly related to the crown height. \nThe crown height acts as a vertical cantilever, which magniies \nthe force on the abutment screw (Fig. 16.2).8\nParafunction. Of all the external forces that cause screw \nloosening, the primary factor is parafunction related. A hori-\nzontal bruxing patient loads the implant crown with an \nangled force repeatedly. This increases the magnitude of \nforce, cycles to fatigue failure, and the angle of the force that \nplaces shear on the interface. Abutment screw loosening can \nbe expected in a patient with a severe bruxing habit. A para-\nfunction patient increases the amount of force to the system \nwhile also increasing the number of cycles to the system. \nHence, fractures of porcelain and cement seals and screw \nloosening or fracture are inevitable. When the adjacent \nnatural teeth are mobile to lateral or angled forces, the rigid \nimplant and implant crown may be overloaded. A heavy bite \nforce occlusal adjustment, which allows the adjacent teeth to \nmove before implant crown contact, is recommended to \nreduce the risk of overload.\nFIG 16.1 (A) When stress is plotted on the y-axis and cycles \nto failure are plotted on the x-axis, the fatigue curve of a \nmaterial may be established.

When improper preload \nvia the torqueing process is applied to the abutment screw, \nscrew loosening will often occur. This may be caused by either \nexcessive or insuficient tightening of the abutment screw. An \nimplant screw is similar to a bolt joint in engineering. There \nis a preload (tightening force) placed on the screw, which \ndevelops a force within the screw. As the screw is tightened, \nit elongates, producing tension, which results in the implant \nscrew acting like a spring. The preload stretch of the screw is \nmaintained by frictional force, and the tension between the \nscrew and the implant/abutment is termed a clamping force. \nWhen insuficient preload is applied to the screw, there is \ninsuficient clamping force, which ultimately leads to screw \nloosening, especially under occlusal loading. When excessive \nforce is applied, the clamping force is easily released, and \nscrew loosening will occur (Fig. 16.4).\nScrew Diameter. The diameter of the abutment screw may \nhave a signiicant effect on the amount of preload applied to \nthe system before deformation occurs. The greater the screw \ndiameter, the higher the preload that may be applied, which \nresults in a greater clamping force on the screw joint. However, \nthe coping and prosthetic screws vary greatly according to the \ntype, size, and material. The strength of the material increases \nby a power of four when the diameter of the screw doubles \n(a screw with twice the diameter is 16 times stronger). As a \nresult, abutment screws loosen less often because they can \ntake a higher preload compared with coping and prosthetic \nscrews. Some companies offer similar diameters for abutment \nand prosthetic screws. As a result, a similar clamping force \nmay be used for either component (Fig. 16.5).\nScrew Material. The composition of the screw is another \nfactor that modiies its performance. The composition of the \nContinuous occlusal loads can have a cumulative effect on \nthe preload, and the screw material may undergo deforma-\ntion.9 When the force exceeds the yield strength, plastic defor-\nmation occurs, and the screw begins to deform. This material \ndeformation causes the screw to loosen and leads to potential \nfailure of the prosthesis.\nScrew loosening is also affected by the amount of the force \nand the number of cycles and is similar to fatigue. External \nmethods to limit screw loosening include factors that reduce \nthe biomechanical stress. These include key implant positions \n(i.e., to distribute forces evenly), suficient number of implants \n(i.e., adequate surface area), passive frameworks, and ade-\nquate occlusal schemes.10\nSplinted vs. Nonsplinted Crowns. Screw loosening of abut-\nment or prosthetic screws occurs more often on individual \nimplant crowns than on crowns that are splinted together. For \nexample, in a report for single molar replacement, the abut-\nment screw-loosening rate was 40% during a 3-year period. \nWhen two splinted implants were used to replace the molar \nspace, the screw loosening was reduced to 8%.11 The stress \ndistribution of splinted prosthetic units results in less force \napplied to the screw system. Studies have shown splinted \nimplant-retained overdentures have far less screw loosening \nin comparison to ixed prostheses.12\nCrown/Abutment Not Fully Seated. If the abutment is not \nfully seated because of improper abutment placement, tissue \nimpingement, or bone impingement, a poor distribution of \nforce in the screw system will result, which leads to increased \nscrew loosening. When the abutment is not seated fully and \ncompletely tightened, the prosthetic screw will be distorted, \nwhich leads to inadequate preload and subsequent screw \nloosening or fracture (Fig. 16.3).\nA\nB\nC\nFP-1\nFP-3\nFIG 16.2 (A) Excessive crown height space comparing an FP-3 to a FP-1, which leads to a verti-\ncal cantilever to any angle load.

(C) Poor \nimplant positioning (e.g., implant placement too far posterior) leading to excessive resultant force \nfrom cantilever effect and greater stress on the screw system. Note the signiicant cusp height \nand opposing cusp concavity, which increases the shear component of force on the implant \nsystem.

This is not a consequence \nrelative to permanent deformation or fracture because it is \nmore than twice as strong as the other grades of titanium.\nThe metal for the screwdriver used in the torque wrench \nis also important to consider. Stripping of the screw head \nprevents the clinician from tightening or removing the screw. \nSome manufacturers make the torque wrench driver out of \ntitanium alloy, and the screw is made of gold or titanium. The \nconcept is that the torque wrench will not deform the hexagon \nand will not strip, so the device lasts longer. However, this is \nnot ideal. It is easier to replace the torque wrench driver than \nthe abutment or prosthetic screw. Because of this, the torque \nwrench should be made of titanium and the screw of tita-\nnium alloy.\nFrom a clinical standpoint the receptor site for the torque \nwrench is also a feature of the screw head to consider. The \nscrew head has a rotation feature, most commonly a hexago-\nnal design. The more sides to the rotation feature, the more \noften the head will strip. A slot or triangular feature will strip \nless than a hexagon (Fig. 16.6).\nComponent Fit. In the science of machining metal compo-\nnents, there is a range of dimensions that manufacturers use. \nFor instance, an implant 4 mm in diameter may actually range \nfrom 3.99 mm to 4.01 mm. Likewise, the abutment and pros-\nthetic coping connection also has a range. As a result, if a smaller \nimplant body hex dimension is mated with a larger abutment \nconnection, the components may not ideally it together. Most \nimplant manufacturers allow for a misit range that results in \nthe abutment or coping being able to rotate ±10 degrees on the \nimplant body. Components between the abutment and implant \nbody may have a misit of 10 degrees in a rotational dimension, \nand horizontal discrepancies have been reported up to \n99 µm.14,15 These ranges are different with respect to each \nimplant system. The more accurate the component it, the less \nforce applied to the abutment or prosthetic screw (Fig. 16.7).\nThe incidence of screw loosening is also a function of the \naccuracy of it of the lat-to-lat connection of the implant \nand abutment or prosthetic component. Implant abutment \nmagnitude can be used on the titanium alloy abutment screw \nand female component (found within the implant body), less \non grade 4 titanium, less on grade 1 titanium, and the least \non gold screws.\nThe elongation of metal is related to the modulus of elas-\nticity, which depends on the type of material, width, design, \nand the amount of stress applied. The material of which the \nscrew is made (e.g., titanium alloy, titanium, or gold) has a \nspeciic modulus of elasticity. A prosthetic gold screw exhibits \ngreater elongation than a screw made of titanium alloy but \nhas a lower yield strength.\nAlthough the strengths of titanium grades are dramatically \ndifferent, the modulus of elasticity is similar for grade 1 to 4 \ntitanium. Hence, the strain of the abutment screw is similar \nwith each grade of titanium, but the safety load relative to \nfracture is different. Titanium alloy (grade 5) has a slightly \nhigher modulus of elasticity. Although not clinically relevant to \nFIG 16.5 Screw sizes vary according to manufacturers. In \ngeneral, the larger the screw diameter, the greater preload \nthat may be applied. Care should be exercised to not place \ntoo high of a torque as this will lead to screw deformation \nand screw loosening. \nFIG 16.6 Variation of abutment screw threads.

A \nmachine coping connection is still present, so it is superior \nto the plastic components used to cast one metal.18 The risk \nof oxides forming between the coping and metal of the pros-\nthesis is also reduced (Fig. 16.8).\nImplant Design. The type and design of the dental implant \nhas a signiicant impact on screw loosening. As a general rule, \nmost implant bodies have an antirotational feature for the \nabutment connection. The most common designs are an \nexternal hexagon, an internal hexagon, a Morse taper, and a \nMorse taper with threads.\nFactors that affect the abutment screw connection and \nscrew loosening include the height (or depth) of the hexagon \nand the platform diameter. Boggan et al studied the inluence \nof design factors on the mechanical strength and quality of \nit of the implant abutment interface. Whereas failure mode \nfor static test samples was bending or deformation of the \nabutment screw, fracture of the abutment screw was the \nconnections or prosthetic connections with an unstable \nmating interface place undue stress on the screw that con-\nnects the components. Mechanical testing has demonstrated \na direct correlation between the tolerance of the lat-to-lat \ndimension of the external hexagon and the stability of the \nabutment or prosthetic screw. Binon showed that a mean \nlat-to-lat range of less than 0.005 mm exists on the hexagon, \nand a lat-to-lat range of less than 0.05 mm for the entire \nsample would result in a more stable screw joint.16 Studies \nhave shown plastic castable patterns, which can be highly \ninaccurate, to have a vertical misit as high as 66 µm.17\nThe same manufacturing conditions apply to impression \ntransfer copings and analogs. Many manufacturers have a \nwider machining range (+ or − variance) for the prosthetic \ncomponents to reduce the cost of manufacturing. When trans-\nfer copings and analogs are used in impressions and then to \nfabricate the prosthesis in the laboratory and the implants are \nsplinted together, the prosthesis may not passively seat.\nMany manufacturers recommend the use of plastic (non-\nmetal) burn-out posts. Plastic burnout prosthetic copings \ncost less, but they exhibit much greater laboratory variance \nand poor it because of irregularities and settling of the super-\nstructure. Besides cost, another advantage of a plastic burnout \npattern for a coping is that one type of metal is used for the \ncoping and superstructure, lessening the risk of metal corro-\nsion or separation between the coping and superstructure.\nTo reduce settling a machined coping may be used to it \nthe implant abutment more accurately. Some manufacturers \nsuggest a titanium coping to reduce the risk of misit. However, \noxides form on the titanium-machined coping surface and \nimpair metal adherence when the prosthesis or abutment \nmetal work is cast to the coping. Mechanical retentive features \non the coping improve this metal-to-metal attachment.\nLaboratory studies demonstrate that an alloy-cylinder \ncompatibility exists when noble metal alloys are used rather \nFIG 16.7 The rotational it of the abutment-to-implant body \nis variable from one manufacturer to another.

The static \nfailure load was greater for the external hex implants of 1 mm \nin height compared with implants with an internal hexagon \nof 1.7 mm. The larger-diameter implant had the greatest \nstatic load before failure (Table 16.1).8 As the hexagon height \n(or depth) increases, the load on the abutment screw \ndecreases. Likewise, as the diameter of the implant platform \nincreases, the force on the abutment screw decreases. Reduc-\ntion of the lateral load (P) on the abutment screw is crucial \nto prevent the load on the screw to be beyond the yield \nstrength of the material.\nThe height (or depth) of the antirotational hexagon is \ndirectly related to the force applied to the abutment screw \nwith any lateral load. Because the crown is connected to the \nabutment and the abutment rests on the implant platform, a \nlateral force on the crown creates a tipping force on the abut-\nment. This tipping force is resisted by the hexagon height or \ndepth, the platform, and the abutment screw. When the arc of \nrotation is above the hexagon height, all of the force is applied \nto the abutment screw. For the hexagon height to be above the \narc of tipping forces, the hexagon height must be at least 1 mm \nfor a 4-mm-diameter implant. Yet many implant manufactur-\ners feature a hexagon height of only 0.7 mm, so almost all of \nthe force is directed to the abutment screw, increasing the \noccurrence of screw loosening and fracture (Fig. 16.9).\nThe difference between external vs. internal connections \nhas been well documented. Studies have shown the incidence \nassociated with external-connection (EC) implants was \n18.3% at a mean of 5.3 years (217 of 1183 restorations; \nmaximum, 59.9%).19,20 The complication rate with internal-\nconnection (IC) implants was 2.7% at a mean of 4.5 years \n(142 of 5235 restorations; maximum, 31.6%).21,22 Other \nstudies have shown the external hex to have a signiicantly \nhigher incidence of screw loosening than internal hex \n(MA-EC, 15.1%; Zr-EC, 6.8%; MA-IC, 1.5%; Zr-IC, 0.9%).23\nThe platform dimension upon which the abutment is \nseated is also an important factor in screw loosening. Larger-\ndiameter implants, with associated larger platform dimen-\nsions, reduce the forces applied to an abutment screw and \nchange the arc of displacement of the abutment on the crest \nmodule. For example, in a report by Cho et al, abutment \nscrew loosening over a 3-year period was almost 15% for a \n4-mm implant diameter but less than 6% for the 5-mm \nimplant diameter (Fig. 16.10).24\nTABLE 16.1 Failure Loads of Various \nImplant Types\nImplant Type\nStatic Failure Load (N)\n1.0 mm external hexagon, 4 mm\n966\n1.0 mm external hexagon, 5 mm\n1955\n0.7 mm external hexagon\n756\n0.6 mm internal octagon\n587\n1.7 mm internal hexagon\n814\nFrom Misch CE: Dental implant prosthetics, ed 2, St Louis, \n2015, Mosby.\nFIG 16.9 The higher (or deeper) the antirotational hexagon com-\nponent (x component on the graph), the less the force applied \nto the abutment screw (Fs) on the y-axis.

The more \npassive the it on the implant abutment for screw retention \nand the more controlled the occlusal forces, and the more \nsecure the prosthesis. The repeated compressive and tensile \nforces from nonpassive castings under occlusal loads cause \nvibration and loosening of the screw components. Accuracy \nin design and fabrication of the metal superstructure are \ndetermining factors for the reduction of forces at the implant \nabutment and implant-bone interface.\nPassive screw-retained restorations are more dificult to fab-\nricate than passive cement-retained restorations. When the \nscrew is threaded into position, the superstructure may distort, \nthe implant may move within the bone, or the abutment screw \nmay distort. The distortion of the superstructure and implant \nsystem may reach a level such that a 500-µm original gap may \nnot be detectable.26 As a result, the casting may appear to it \nthe implant abutment for screw retention. However, the super-\nstructure, bone, and components do not bend beyond their \nelastic limit, and compression, tensile, and shear forces are \nplaced on the bone-implant interface.27 The bone must remodel \nto eliminate these forces. If the forces are beyond physiologic \nor ultimate strength limits, resorption of the bone-implant \ninterface occurs. As a result, greater crestal bone loss has been \nassociated with nonpassive castings. Creep (a constant force \napplied over time on a material) or fatigue also can contribute \nto fracture of the components over time because of a constant \nload or cyclic load frequency (Figs. 16.11 to 16.13).\nAnatomic Location. The location of the prosthesis in the \noral cavity is also a signiicant factor in the incidence of screw \nloosening. Sadid-Zadeh showed a signiicant incidence differ-\nence with respect to anatomic locations; anterior (12.8%; 51 \nof 398 restorations) and posterior positioning (4.8%; 144 of \n2972 restorations). However, when evaluating internal con-\nnection implants, they had an associated higher incidence of \nscrew loosening in the posterior region (4.3%) than the ante-\nrior region (0.7%).28\nPrevention\nDecreased Force. Because of the directional relationship \nbetween force and screw loosening, the evaluation, diagnosis, \nand modiication of treatment plans related to stress condi-\ntions are of considerable importance.

Additionally, implant protec-\ntion principles should be adhered to including reduction of \ncuspal inclines of the prosthesis (decreased cusp height), \ndecreased occlusal table, and no lateral contacts, especially in \nthe posterior.\nIdeal Preload. The ideal torque force on an abutment screw \nvaries by manufacturer and may range from 10–35 N/cm. \nThis preload is determined by many variables including the \nscrew material, screw head design, abutment material, abut-\nment surface, and possible lubricant. To reduce the incidence \nof screw loosening, the abutment screw should be torqued by \nthe following protocol:\n1. Light inger tighten with driver (~10 N/cm)\n2. Maximum inger tighten with driver (~20 N/cm)\n3. Implant screw should be torqued to the manufacturer \nspeciications\n4. After 5–10 minutes, the screw should be retorqued to the \nsame manufacturer speciications.\nNote: For cases of expected increased force, the implant \nscrew may be retorqued a third time after 30–60 days.\nScrew Tightening Sequence. When screw tightening a \nmulti-unit ixed implant prostheses, a proper sequence and \ntechnique is crucial to obtain the correct torque. The torque \nshould be applied incrementally amongst all screws so that \nnot one screw is tightened fully. This is based on the fact that \na multi-unit prosthesis is unlikely to be “completely” passive. \nA nonideal tightening sequence will lead to either an insuf-\nicient or excessive amount of torque placed onto a speciic \nscrew thread. Undertorque will lead to insuficient clamping \nforce and lack of ideal stretching of the screw. This will most \noften lead to screw loosening. Overtorque will lead to perma-\nnent deformation of the screw which may lead to screw \nfracture (Fig. 16.14).\nSettling Effect. Settling is a term used to describe the effect \nof various implant parts wearing and itting closer together. \nMinor irregularities on or within a casting that incorporates \nthe top of an abutment or screw can cause slight elevation of \nthe casting or the screw head. Over time, micromovement \nwears down the irregularities, and the parts it closer together. \nHowever, this settling relaxes the preload force on the pros-\nthetic screw and is more likely to cause screw loosening. \nThis embedment relaxation or loss of preload has been \nFIG 16.14 Screw tightening sequence.

With the use of two mirror \nhandles placed on the buccal and lingual aspect of the \ncrown, a buccal-lingual force is applied to evaluate the mobil-\nity of the prosthesis. This will result in a subjective response \nfrom the patient experiencing either pain or no pain.\nNo pain: if no pain is present, then it is most likely the \nabutment screw is loose.\nPain: if pain is present, it may be the result of either the \nabutment loosening or implant failure. With respect to \nthe abutment screw, the pain will originate from the \nmovement of the crown, most likely resulting from \ntissue impingement. In some situations, this can be veri-\nied by a radiograph showing incomplete seating of the \nprosthesis with the abutment. If the pain originates from \nthe implant, this will usually indicate failure of the implant.\nStep 2: Palpation of buccal/lingual cortical plates. A \nsecond test is to palpate the buccal and lingual cortical \nplates over the implant body. If no pain is present, then it \nis most likely the abutment. If pain is present, it is usually \na sign the implant has failed.\nshown to be approximately 2% to 10 % of the initial preload \nwithin the irst few seconds or minutes after tightening. This \nis the reasoning for the above protocol to include a second \nretorque after 5–10 min to regain the lost preload due to \nsettling (Fig. 16.15).29\nTorque Under Moist Conditions. Studies have shown when \nplacing and torqueing abutment screws, more accurate torque \nvalues result under wet conditions vs. dry.30 Saline may be \nused to lubricate the screw prior to placement of preload to \nmaximize the accuracy of the preload.\nWider Implant Bodies. The use of wider implant bodies \nresults in decreased force on the screw. Graves has shown \nincreasing implant size from 3.75 mm to 5.0 mm results in \n20% greater strength, while increasing implant size from \n3.75 mm to 6.0 mm to increases the strength by 33%.31\nTreatment\nWhen confronted with a mobile prosthesis, it is important to \ndetermine if the mobility is a result of screw loosening or the \nactual implant being mobile (implant failure). Box 16.2 \nshows a technique to determine the etiology of the prosthesis \nmovement (Fig. 16.16).\nImplant Movement. Mobility of the implant indicates failure of \nthe implant and necessitates immediate removal. A radiograph \nmay reveal a circumferential radiolucency. The site should \nthen be reevaluated after adequate healing for the need of bone \ngrafting, implant placement, or change in prosthetic treatment \nplanning (Fig. 16.17).\nAbutment Screw Movement\nOption 1. Removing a cemented crown from a mobile \nabutment is very challenging with crown removal techniques \n(e.g., crown bumper). The impact force that is applied to the \nmobile crown is dissipated because of the loose screw. This \nmay result in damage to the internal threads of the implant \nbody. In addition, when an implant crown margin is subgin-\ngival, it is often dificult to obtain access for the crown \nremover. In poorer bone densities, overzealous use of a crown \nremover may result in loss of bone-implant interface.\nOption 2. The safest and most predictable treatment \noption to treat abutment movement is accomplished with \nmaking an occlusal access, and turning the cement-retained \ncrown into a screw-retained crown (Fig. 16.18).\nThe following are the steps for completing this procedure:\n1. Evaluate and determine the location and angulation of the \nimplant abutment screw (buccal-lingually and mesial-\ndistally). An intraoral radiograph is often helpful."

Care should \nbe exercised when cutting the crown off because in most cases \nit is dificult to determine the cement location (Fig. 16.19). \nThis may result in sectioning the crown too deep causing \ndamage to the abutment, abutment screw, or implant body \n(Fig. 16.20).

If the abutment remains ixated to the prosthesis, the \nprosthesis can be easily removed by gently heating the pros-\nthesis with a Bunsen burner.\nSCREW FRACTURE\nEtiology\nThe etiologic factor most likely to cause screw fractures is \nbiomechanical stress to the implant system. The biomechani-\ncal stress leads to partially unretained restorations or fatigue, \nwhich is directly related to an increased amount of force. \nProsthesis screw fracture has been shown to occur with a \nmean incidence of 4% with a range of 0% to 19%. Abutment \nscrew fracture is directly related to the screw diameter, with \nlarger-diameter screws fracturing less often, with a mean inci-\ndence of 2% and a range of 0.2% to 8%3 (Fig. 16.21).\nThe etiology of abutment screw fracture is the same for \nscrew loosening (see above).\nPrevention\nImmediate Treatment of Loose Screw.

There are multiple \nretrieval kits on the market that are used to remove fractured \nscrews. These are usually speciic for the type of implant body \ntype (internal, external, trilobe, etc.) (Fig. 16.26).\nEXCESSIVE TORQUE APPLIED TO THE \nABUTMENT SCREW/PROSTHESIS\nEtiology\nThe amount of force applied to tighten a screw joint is related \nto the success and technique in placement of the screw \npreload. Torque rotational forces on a screw may be measured \nin newton-centimeters (N-cm). Too large of a torque (exceed-\ning manufacturers’ recommendations) leads to a low clamp-\ning force, which increases the risk of loosening. The clamping \nforces on a metal-to-metal screw component are one of the \nmore important considerations for long-term screw ixation. \nThe joint strength is improved the most by achieving ideal \nclamping forces. The clamp force is directly proportional to \nthe force used to tighten the screw or the preload.\nThe torque applied to a screw component affects both the \ncompressive forces in the threads and the compressive force \napplied to the head of the screw on the recipient component. \nThe torque applied to the screw will also result in tensile \nforces within the male component of the screw. The compres-\nsive and tensile forces from the torque forces are magniied \nbecause they are applied to the inclined plane of the screw \ncomponents. The tensile forces attempt to lengthen (strain) \nthe screw when adequate torque is applied. The strain (change \nin length divided by original length) of the screw is also \nrelated directly to the amount of torque force. The higher the \nforce, the greater the strain. Too great a torque force causes \nplastic or permanent deformation or a permanent change in \nthe material, at which point the screw is no longer retrievable \nand additional force causes fracture of the screw. Too large a \ntorque results in fracture of the screw or stripping of the \nthread components (Fig. 16.27).\nPrevention\nIdeal Torque. The suggested amount of the torque for a \npreload should be 75% of the value to reach permanent \ndeformation of the screw material.32 The amount of preload \napplied to a screw joint should be consistent and adequate \nenough to cause deformation (strain) within the screw thread. \nIn the original screw retention system of Nobelpharma from \n1980 to 1990, only inger pressure from a handheld screw-\ndriver was used to tighten screws. However, a hand screw-\ndriver has been shown to produce an inconsistent torque \nvalue. In a study by Misch with 136 dentists, the average \ntorque placed on a screw joint with a hand screwdriver was \n11 N-cm and ranged from 5 to 21 N-cm. As a consequence, \nabutment and screw loosening during that era was observed \nin almost 50% of the restorations.\nRound Bur (205LN). A very small round bur or 205LN can \nbe used in a slow-speed handpiece or AS123 screwdriver. The \ntip of the bur is placed at the seam of the fractured screw and \nabutment (implant). As the bur spins clockwise, the friction \nplaced on the screw makes it turn counterclockwise, and the \nscrew unthreads (Fig. 16.23).\nInverted Cone Bur (≈33 1 2 Bur). With an inverted cone bur \nin a high-speed handpiece (ideally electric handpiece in \nreverse), gently touch the top of the screw. This will usually \nresult in the screw being extruded from the implant body. \nCare should be exercised to not touch the implant body with \nthe bur because this will result in damage to the implant body \nthreads. With this technique, always use a throat pack to \nprevent loss (Fig. 16.24).\nSlot the Top of Screw. A slot 1 mm deep is made through \nthe center of the screw with a high-speed handpiece and a \nvery narrow issure bur (or 3312 bur). A small screwdriver is \nthen used to unthread the screw. Be careful using this tech-\nnique because the bur may inadvertently perforate the side of \nthe implant body. There is no predictable method to repair \nthe implant body if this occurs.

When implant \nprostheses opposed a denture, no fracture was observed. \nWhen implant prostheses opposed each other, 16% of the \ndental units experienced a fracture of porcelain. The higher \nforces in the implant system (including the occlusal porce-\nlain) were related to a dramatic increase in biomechanical \ncomplications. The fracture rate was greatest for bruxism \npatients or group function occlusal patients with 34.9% and \n51.9% of patients, respectively, affected. The percentage of \nporcelain units that fractured in these two conditions were \n18.9% and 16.1%, respectively. Note that the incidence of \nporcelain fracture, even in patients without higher force con-\nditions, is greater than observed with natural teeth.\nEtiology\nThe second most common complication for ixed prostheses \non natural teeth is porcelain fracture. Occlusal material \nfracture is more common with implants than natural \nteeth because of the lack of periodontal stress relief with \nimplants and a resultant higher impact force to the occlusal \nmaterial.36\nConsistent Torque. A torque wrench is required to obtain a \nconsistent value of torque. However, several reports have \nshown that most torque wrenches are not completely \naccurate and components may corrode after autoclaving \nmany times, which may increase the torque applied to the \nsystem.33,34 There exist two types of torque wrenches, friction \nand spring. Studies have shown that spring-type wrenches are \nmore accurate and have less chance of over-torquing the \nabutment screw.\nAutoclaving hand torque wrenches in the open position \nand the clinician testing the torque wrench before use are \nsuggested to make sure the components are not frozen \nin place, which will increase overtorque. Periodically, the \ntorque wrench should be recalibrated or replaced (≈ after 100 \nautoclave cycles) by the implant company or manufacturer \n(Fig. 16.28).\nPROSTHESES FRACTURES/OCCLUSAL \nMATERIAL FRACTURE\nIn a retrospective analysis by Kinsel and Lin, porcelain fail-\nures of metal ceramic crowns and ixed partial dentures sup-\nported by implants ranged from 0% to 53% of patients and \nwere directly related to force factors.35 For example, whereas \nFIG 16.23 Round bur (205LN).

Additionally, an implant abut-\nment is usually smaller in diameter than a natural tooth, \nresulting in less surface area. With less surface area, a greater \npossibility of loss of retention may result. To complicate the \nsituation further, many clinicians often desire to make implant \nrestorations retrievable to more easily handle future compli-\ncations. A softer cement (temporary implant cement) is often \nused for implant crowns, which additionally predisposes to \nuncemented restorations (Fig. 16.33).\nPrevention\nRetention/Resistance Form. The tenets of retention and \nresistance of ixed prosthodontics are directly applicable to \nimplant abutments and include taper, surface area, height, the \ngeometry of the abutment preparation, surface roughness, \nand luting agents (Box 16.3).\nAbutment Taper. The retention of a crown has been shown to \nrapidly decrease as the taper is increased from 6 to 25 degrees.41 \nTaper degree is deined as the sum of both sides of the prepara-\ntion. A typical tapered diamond bur is ideally fabricated to \nexhibit a taper of about 3 degrees on each side, or a 6-degree \ntotal taper. The parallelism of the axial walls has been recognized \nto be the single most effective factor for retention.42 The ideal \ntaper originally was recommended to be within 2 to 5 degrees \nof parallelism of the path of insertion, which also places minimal \nstress concentrations on prepared abutments.43\nUnfortunately, most manufactured stock implant abut-\nments for cement exhibit total tapers ranging from 10 to over \n30 degrees. As a result, the retentive surfaces of the more \nmore unsupported porcelain (>2 mm). To limit the amount \nof unsupported porcelain, the incisal edge and occlusal table \nposition of the prosthesis must be planned before fabrication \nof the metal superstructure. The technician then may fabri-\ncate a full-contour wax-up of the inal prosthesis and after-\nward reduce the contour by 2 mm in the regions where \nporcelain is to be added. A common error is to fabricate \nthe metal framework, then determine the incisal position \n(Fig. 16.32).\nUNCEMENTED PROSTHESIS\nUncemented prostheses are the third most common cause of \nixed prostheses failure on natural teeth.40 This complication is \neven more common with implant abutments because they are \nmore rigid and higher forces are transmitted to the cement \ninterface. Kourtis has reported an uncemented prosthesis to be \nthe second most common implant prosthetic complication, \nwhich compose 25% of the documented complications.4\nEtiology\nImplant Abutment. An implant prosthesis is most often sus-\nceptible to loss of cementation when chronic loads or shear \nforces are applied to the prosthesis, which eventually weakens \nthe cement interface. With dental implants an uncemented \nrestoration is more common because of the inherent qualities \nthat an implant abutment exhibits. The implant abutment is \nusually made of titanium alloy, which predisposes the resto-\nration to inferior cement adherence in comparison to a \nnatural tooth. In dentistry today, most cements are made to \nadhere to the interface with the dentin of a natural tooth. The \nFIG 16.33 (A) Implant abutment often has decreased surface area and nonideal taper. (B) Most \nstock abutments have a smooth surface leading to possible uncemented restoration.

Studies have shown a 2-mm \nincrease in height will increase retention up to 40%, especially \nwhen the abutment is only 4 mm in diameter. An increase in \nheight from 4 to 7 mm results in a 67% increase in reten-\ntion.45 When the height of the implant abutment is less than \n5 mm, the diameter of the implant abutment is more critical \nto improve cement retention or resistance. A customized \nabutment, larger in diameter than the stock abutment, may \nbe necessary to retain the restoration. In these instances, addi-\ntional abutment height not only increases the surface area but \nalso results in increased retention and resistance form. The \nlonger axial walls allow for more compressive and tensile \nforce, rather than damaging shear stress.\nGeometry of Abutment. Manufactured implant abutments \nfor cement are usually circular in cross section, providing \nlittle resistance to shear forces, especially on individual, \nunsplinted crowns. The surface area of an abutment exposed \nto shear forces is more critical than the total surface area \nunder tensile force.46 The strength of the cement interface is \nweakest under the shear component of a force. A lat side on \nthe implant abutment preparation decreases shear forces on \nthe cement interface. Whenever possible, a preparation with \none or two lat sides should be made on circular abutments \nfor cemented prostheses (Fig. 16.37).\nA tapered implant abutment post may provide multiple \npaths of insertion or removal. The addition of one or more \nparallel-sided grooves to an abutment limits the path of with-\ndrawal of the crown to one direction.47 Whenever possible, \nretentive elements such as grooves parallel to the path of inser-\ntion should be added to a short or excessively tapered implant \nabutment for cement. Additional grooves parallel to the path \nof insertion mechanically resist rotational forces, place com-\npressive forces on the cement in these regions, and dramatically \nimprove cementation.48 However, caution should be exercised \non the outer walls of two-piece abutments. These abutments \nmost likely have thin walls, and a groove may perforate or \nweaken the abutment (Figs. 16.38 and 16.39).\ntapered, unprepared implant abutments provide less retention \nthan natural abutments. The preparation in the cervical third \nof the abutment near the crown margins may be indicated in \nthe more tapered implant abutments to reduce the taper even \nwhen the path of insertion is satisfactory (Fig. 16.34).\nAbutment Surface Area. The surface area of an implant \nabutment inluences the amount of retention. The parame-\nters of retention are similar for a tooth or implant and mainly \nare inluenced by the diameter and height of the abutment. \nStudies have shown a linear increase in retention occurs \nas the diameter increases for preparations with identical \nheight, and a wider abutment offers greater retention than a \nnarrower abutment.44\nThe diameter of an implant abutment for cement reten-\ntion is often less than 5 mm (posterior region), which is com-\nparable to that of a prepared lateral incisor. The decreased \nsurface area results in poorer retention than most natural \nabutments. Wider implant abutments usually have more \nretention than standard-size abutments. A wider abutment \ncan be obtained by two methods. First, a wider implant body \nhas a corresponding wider abutment for cement than a \nsmaller-diameter implant. Second, the abutment may have a \nwider emergence design than the implant body (or abutment \nlare). The greater-diameter abutment has many advantages \nincluding providing a greater taper, a thicker outer body wall, \nand more surface area for retention (Fig. 16.35).\nAdditionally, preparing or roughening the abutment \nsurface will result an increased surface area. The surface of \nstock or premanufactured abutments should be modiied \nwith a diamond bur, cross-cut issure carbide, or a heatless \nstone. This will also increase mechanical retention for cemen-\ntation (Fig. 16.36).\nAbutment Height. With dental implant abutments, the \nlonger (increased height) the abutment, the greater the \nFIG 16.34 As the taper of an implant abutment is increased \nfrom 6 to 25 degrees, the retention of the crown is rapidly \ndecreased.

The arc of rotation of the crown inluences the dis-\nlodging forces and is affected by the direction of forces. The \nsurface design and conditions of the preparation farthest \nfrom the fulcrum or rotation point provide the resistance to \nuncementation. The greatest resistance factors of the abut-\nment for cement retention to a moment force are a minimum \nabutment taper and maximum abutment height. The higher \nthe abutment, the greater its resistance to lateral forces. The \nheight of the abutment should ideally be greater than the arc \nformed by the crown rotating about a fulcrum at the margin \nof the opposite side of the restoration (Fig. 16.40).43\nMost implant abutment heights range from 4 to 10 mm. \nSome manufacturers only supply ≈5-mm abutments to save \nthe clinician preparation time. Although this may be ade-\nquate in some situations, a cantilever or ixed prosthesis with \na large crown height often may require longer implant abut-\nments to resist the arc of removal or to resist lateral forces in \nthe anterior regions of the mouth. In cases with insuficient \nheight, ideally a custom abutment should be fabricated to \nincrease retention and resistance form (Fig. 16.41).\nA wider-diameter implant abutment provides greater \nretention but may offer less resistance to moment forces than \nFIG 16.36 (A) Stock abutments depicting smooth surface and signiicant taper.

The surface texture of the abut-\nment increases the retention of a restoration by creating \nmicroretentive irregularities into which the luting agent proj-\nects. The surface retention depends on the surface texture, the \ntype of burs used for the preparation, and the type and thick-\nness of the luting agent.49 The clinician may use a coarse \ndiamond over the surface of the implant abutment to increase \nthe amount and depth of microscopic scratches on the surface \nto more than 40 µm. The internal aspect of the casting can \nalso be air abraded with 50 µm of alumina to enhance its \nretention for cementation by as much as 64%.50\nAbutment Resistance Form. The resistance form of an abut-\nment opposes the uncementation of the prosthesis against \nforces directed in apical, oblique, or horizontal directions.46 \nForces most likely to cause uncemented restorations related \nto resistance are associated with parafunction, long spans, \ncantilevers, mobile natural abutment teeth joined to implants, \noffset loading, and horizontal loads from occlusal contacts.\nWhen a force is directed within the margins of the abut-\nment crowns, leverage or tipping forces are limited. However, \nfor implant-supported prostheses, forces often are projected \naway from the abutment, usually facially. In addition, excur-\nsive movements generate a leverage force, especially on"

Implant abutments are a common indica-\ntion for minimum abutment margin reduction because they \nare usually smaller in diameter than a prepared natural tooth \nfor a crown (5 mm or less). Reduction of the abutment diam-\neter to achieve room for porcelain or a beveled margin further \ndecreases the surface area for retention. Additional space for \nmetal and porcelain in the region of the margins typically is \nnot required because the implant is already smaller in diam-\neter than the cervical aspect of the tooth and suficient volume \nis available for the restorative materials (Fig. 16.47).\nPrevention/Treatment\nPosition. The subgingival margin for teeth or implants \nshould not proceed further than 1.5 mm below the free gin-\ngival margin even in the interproximal region. It is important \nto note that the implant abutment lare is often 1 mm above \nthe implant body connection, which is often at the crest of \nthe bone. When the tissues are 2.5 mm thick (or more), the \nabutment lare is apical to the crown margin location.\nMargin Type. Traditional preparations on teeth usually \nrestrict the use of knife-edge margins (minimum tooth prep-\naration) to avoid overcontouring of the inal restoration. No \nscientiic studies have stated that chamfers or chamfer and \naprons are superior to other inish lines, but the ease of prep-\naration has made them desirable and avoids excessive bulk of \nrestorations. However, whenever minimum implant abut-\nment or tooth preparation is indicated, a knife-edge inish \nline should be considered (Box 16.4).\nFIG 16.47 Porcelain may be bonded to the knife-edge margin \nwhen additional bulk and contour are necessary to develop \nthe emergence of the crown. The porcelain applied to the \nknife-edge margin may extend from the metal coping to any \nemergence contour desired.

The \namount of abutment material removed for parallelism jeopar-\ndizes the width of the implant abutment. Minimum structure \nremoval of the implant or natural tooth on the side toward the \nangulation is suggested to reduce these complications.\nAn exception to a knife-edge abutment margin is when the \nimplant is too facial or too close to an adjacent tooth and a \nporcelain crown margin is desired. Crown margin designs \nsuch as a shoulder or chamfer can be selected in cases in \nwhich the implants are placed too facially so as to create suf-\nicient space for the restoration and avoid overcontouring \n(Fig. 16.48). Another indication for greater reduction is to \nallow for suficient space in a mesiodistal dimension for the \nprosthesis when two implants are too close to each other. \nPreparation will need to be made to allow for ideal hygiene \npractices.\nNONPASSIVE PROSTHESIS\nThe passive it of a prosthesis was irst described by Bråne-\nmark to be approximately 10 µm between the prosthesis and \nthe implant or abutment.51 Other authors have shown mar-\nginal its up to 100 µm are clinically acceptable, with larger \ngaps having a greater chance of bacterial colonization and \nincreasing inlammation around the implants.52 The deini-\ntion of passive it has evolved to be a clinical “acceptable it \nin which the stress/strain conditions are within the physio-\nlogic range that enables immature bone to mature and \nremodel in response to occlusal loads following physiologic \nconnection.”53 A horizontal it discrepancy leads to binding \nof the screws and bending stresses in the implant system. A \nvertical it discrepancy results in the preload bringing the \nmating surfaces together, which predisposes the screw to \nfatigue fractures and loosening.54\nIdeally, when a prosthesis is retained by prosthetic (coping) \nscrews, the restoration passively sits on top of the abutments, \nand the prosthetic screws ixate the two components together. \nWhen the prosthesis its passively, the screws place a compres-\nsive or tensile force on the abutments, but no force is trans-\nmitted to the implant bodies (Fig. 16.49). If, however, the \ncasting of the prosthesis does not sit passively on the abut-\nments for screws, the force of the prosthetic screws is then \ntransmitted to the implant bodies (Fig. 16.50)."

A torque force of \n20 N-cm applied on a screw can move two railroad cars. This \nsame force applied to a nonpassive casting tends to distort the \nsuperstructure, underlying bone, and implant components \n(Fig. 16.51). Because the force is constant, it can introduce \nbiomechanical creep into the system, which can fatigue materi-\nals and bone. An implant does not predictably move within \nbone, yet retained stresses from nonpassive castings must be \naccommodated through a bone remodeling process.\nAs a result of all these variables, implant prosthesis distor-\ntions ranging from 291 to 357 µm may be observed during \nthe fabrication of the restoration.55 Passive inal restorations \nare highly unlikely when more than two implants are splinted \ntogether and support a prosthesis with screw retention as \nthe method of ixation. If a casting has a 50-µm misit, the \ncasting and implant may have to move 200 µm before the \nsystem is completely passive (Fig. 16.52).

After prosthesis delivery, an abutment for screw \nretention or prosthesis screw may loosen between appoint-\nments. This usually indicates that the casting is not seated \npassively, yet the cause often is overlooked. Instead, the screws \nare tightened again (often with more torque), and the bone \nmust remodel to release the strain in the implant system. This \nstrain may lead to crestal bone loss and possibly even implant \nfailure.\nIndirect Transfer Copings. The use of indirect transfer \ncopings on multiunit implant cases is a signiicant source of \nnonpassive restoration. An indirect-transfer coping utilizes the \nelastomeric properties of impression material. The indirect-\ntransfer coping is screwed into the abutment or implant body \nand remains in place when a traditional “closed-tray” impres-\nsion is set and removed from the mouth. The indirect-transfer \ncoping is removed from the implant body/abutment in the \nmouth, connected to an implant body analog, and then rein-\nserted into the closed-tray impression. The copings usually \nhave undercuts that engage the elastic impression material \nwhen reinserted, are slightly tapered to allow ease in removal \nfrom the impression, and often have lat sides or smooth \nundercuts to facilitate reorientation in the impression after it \nis removed.\nThe disadvantages of this technique include inaccuracies \nwithin the elastomeric impression material, inability to insert \nthe implant into the correct position, and micromovement of \nthe implant components. The indirect impression transfer \ncopings remain in the mouth when the impression is removed \nand are replaced into the impression before pouring the \nworking or master cast. The greater the permanent deforma-\ntion, the less retentive the impression pin and the more vari-\nable its position in the distorted receptor site. As stone is \nvibrated around the indirect transfer, the attached abutment \nanalog may move, and the inal position may not be accurate \nrelative to the intraoral abutment position.\nAnother source of impression transfer error may occur \nwhen the impression is made. An air bubble inadvertently \nmay be present on the top of the transfer coping; as a result, \nthe transfer may be reinserted into this void beyond its initial \nposition. Some manufacturers have incorporated a screw hole \nor slot in the top of the transfer coping, which should be \nblocked out before making the impression. Otherwise, the \npositive replica in the impression may prevent the indirect \ntransfer from seating completely in the impression before the \npouring of the master model. This will result in deinite inac-\ncuracies of the true position of the implant bodies.\nscrew-retained restorations may create permanent strain con-\nditions on the implant system that can be many times greater \nthan that of cemented prostheses. The microstrain applied to \nthe bone may fall beyond the overload zone and into the \npathologic zone in which bone remodeling occurs with crestal \nbone loss or even implant failure.\nNonpassive prostheses have been shown to be a primary \ncause of unretained restorations, crestal bone loss, implant \ncomponent fracture, and implant mobility. A truly passive \nscrew-retained dental restoration is virtually impossible to \nfabricate on multiple splinted implants.56 There are too many \nvariables that are out of the clinician’s control when attempt-\ning to fabricate a prosthesis.

In a \nstudy comparing tray and impression material performance \nover time, addition silicone impression materials exhibited \nthe longest stability, with up to 720 hours.59 Although varied \nresults have been published, the vast majority of studies \nappear to conclude that the least amount of dimensional \nchange occurs with addition silicones (0.06%) and polyethers \n(0.1%). The use of these materials to make the inal impres-\nsion for a screw-retained restoration is strongly suggested \n(Fig. 16.53).\nLaboratory Process/Materials. Almost all laboratory mate-\nrials will have associated inaccuracies. Dental stone has been \nshown to expand 0.01% to 0.1% and does not correlate to the \ndimensional changes of impression materials.60 In addition, \nthe wax patterns distort while setting or spruing, and the \ninvestment material expands a variable amount.61 The metal \ncastings shrink when cooled, and the shrinkage does not \npermit an accurate metal-to-metal connection.55 The metal \nsuperstructures are often thicker and larger in implant pros-\ntheses than in traditional prostheses because the implant \nabutment is of reduced diameter, and bone loss volume often \nis replaced by the inal prosthesis. Dimensional changes \nduring metalwork fabrication are correlated directly with the \nsize of the casting. The marginal it and tolerance between \nthe implant analog and implant abutment are often different \nfrom actual implant and abutment components.62 Implant \ncomponents are not all fabricated to exact dimensions, and \neach transfer of an implant component has a slightly different \nsize, which leads to misit and is magniied by the number of \ndifferent pieces used during the fabrication steps.\nAs a result of all these variables, implant prosthesis distor-\ntions ranging from 291 to 357 µm may be observed during \nthe fabrication of the restoration.55 Passive inal restorations \nare highly unlikely when more than two implants are splinted \ntogether and support a prosthesis with screw retention as \nthe method of ixation. If a casting has a 50-µm misit, the \ncasting and implant may have to move 200 µm before the \nsystem is completely passive. This is a considerable risk to \ncreate crestal bone loss, loose prosthetic screws, and implant \nfailure (Fig. 16.54).\nImpression Technique. Various techniques have been sug-\ngested to achieve an accurate master cast. The precise transfer \nof the spatial relationships of implants from the mouth to the \nmaster cast with an impression is the irst and critical step to \nensure passive it of implant framework. To maximize the \naccuracy of the impression process, an understanding of \ndirect vs. indirect and open vs. closed impression technique \nmust be understood. A direct-transfer impression coping \nconsists of two components, a hollow transfer coping (often \nsquare) and a long central screw to secure it to the abutment"

The problem in the past with autopolymerizing resin \nis the inherent shrinkage of the material. Acrylic resin has \nbeen shown to have a total shrinkage of acrylic resin between \n6.5% and 7.9% in the irst 24 hours, with 80% of shrinkage \noccurring in the irst 17 minutes after mixing.66 Another \nmaterial that has been shown to be superior is impression \nplaster, which has a setting expansion of 0.01% and 0.12%.67 \nImpression plaster is quick setting, very rigid with no distor-\ntion, easy to manipulate, and inexpensive. If acrylic resin is \nused, a resin scaffold should be fabricated 24 hours in advance \nand then separated and fused together with a low shrinkage \nresin (e.g., Pattern Resin [GC America Inc.]).\nTreatment\nModiication. If a cemented prosthesis is not passive, the \ncasting or abutment may be modiied slightly at the same \ntry-in appointment. High-speed carbides with copious \namounts of water may be used to modify the abutment, \nadjust the internal aspect of the casting, or both, and may \nprovide an immediate solution. The internal aspect of the \ncasting should always be evaluated for any distortions.\nSoldering. A screw-in prosthesis that is not clinically passive \nrequires casting separation and soldering of the casting or a \nnew impression. The separation of the metal superstructure \nmust respect speciic dimensions to ensure the precision of \nthe soldering (0.008 inch). Too much space causes solder \nshrinkage and a weak joint; too little space may cause distor-\ntion from expansion during heating of the casting.68 Indexing \nthe separate pieces also requires greater time, and the patient \nmust return for another appointment after the laboratory \nprocess of soldering, which includes an additional laboratory \nfee (Figs. 16.55 to 16.57).\nor implant body. An “open-tray” impression tray is used to \npermit direct access to the long central screw securing the \ndirect-transfer coping. After the impression material is set in \nthe mouth, the direct-transfer coping screw is unthreaded to \nallow removal of the impression from the mouth. The square \ncoping remains in the impression, seated on the implant \nwithout ixation. This technique utilizes the advantages of \nimpression material with rigid properties and eliminates the \nerror of permanent deformation because the transfer coping \nremains within the impression until the master model is \npoured and separated. They are also less likely to be rotated \nor moved during the model fabrication compared with the \nindirect techniques.\nImpression Recommendation.

However, when natural teeth \nare splinted together, decay at the interproximal margin often \noccurs at a rate of more than 20%.69 In addition, the endodon-\ntic risk is increased when crowns are splinted. Whereas a single \ncrown has an endodontic risk of 3% to 5.6%, splinted teeth \nhave an endodontic risk of 18%.

Additionally, implants \ndo not have the inherent disadvantages of natural teeth, in \nthat they do not decay and are less prone to bone loss from \nbacterial plaque than natural teeth (Fig. 16.58).\nPorcelain Repair. Many clinicians will recommend the use \nof independent crowns on dental implants so they may repair \nporcelain fracture if it occurs.

These procedures are usually more dificult to perform \naround existing teeth and implants than the original implants.\nAdvantages of Splinted Implant Crowns. There are many \nadvantages to splinting dental implants together. To maxi-\nmally beneit from an increased number of implants, the \nimplants should be splinted together. Splinted implants have \nthe following advantages over independent units:\nIncrease the functional surface area of prosthesis \nsupport. Splinted implants increase the functional surface \narea to the support system. When implants are independent, \nthey cannot share the occlusal load from one implant to \nanother.71 As a consequence, with splinted implant crowns, \nthe risks associated with the biomechanical overload to the \nimplant system are reduced (occlusal porcelain, cement, \nscrew, marginal bone loss, implant-bone interface stress, and \nimplant components failure). If a maxillary second molar \nimplant is connected to a maxillary irst molar implant, it can \nshare an occlusal load to the irst molar even when the second \nmolar has no direct occlusal load. As a consequence of splint-\ning, implant survival may be greater. For example, Quiryman \net al72 reported success rates of 90% for single implants, 97% \nfor two splinted implants, and 98% for three splinted implants.\nporcelain-to-metal crowns are most often placed over \nunsupported porcelain with shear loads, which increases the \nrisk of porcelain fracture (interproximal). When dental \nimplants are splinted together, the implants are supported by \nmetal, which results in the porcelain being placed under com-\npressive forces.\nSplinting Is More Dificult. Another perceived reason for \nindependent implant crowns is the belief that splinting makes \nthe case more technically challenging. As individual units, the \ninterproximal contacts can be modiied to seat the individual \ncrowns. Fully seating all the implant crowns, although more \ntime consuming, is supposedly a more accurate technique. \nThe authors disagree with this thought process. The cause of \ncasting misit is related to impression material shrinkage, \nstone expansion, and analog variance of the abutment or \nimplant body. Although this may have been an issue in the \npast, advancements with dental materials and techniques \nhave led to the ability to obtain an accurate prosthesis.\nPlanning for Failure. Another perceived advantage of inde-\npendent implant units is if one implant fails, the clinician \nneeds to replace only one implant and crown. However, the \nimplant failure often causes bone loss, which then requires \nFIG 16.58 Individual vs. splinted implant crowns.

An anteroposterior (A-P) distance between two or \nmore implants is a beneit for any angled load or cantilever, \nespecially when three or more implants are not in a straight \nline. The biomechanics of an arch is of most beneit because \nthere are ive different planes connected together (bilateral \nmolar, bilateral premolar, bilateral canines, and an anterior \nimplant). Rotational forces, angled forces, and cantilevers to \nthe facial or lingual (offset loads) are all reduced when \nsplinted implants are not in the same plane and receive a load \ncomparable to individual units (Fig. 16.59).73\nIncreased retention and resistance form of the prosthe-\nsis. Splinted implant crowns provide greater abutment \nsurface area and resistance form; thus the prosthesis has more \nretention. For a cementable prosthesis, there is less force \ntransferred to the cement interface, which results in less likeli-\nhood of uncementation. This is especially signiicant when \nthe abutments are short or lateral forces are present. Both \ncement retention and resistance form are increased with \nsplinted crowns. The prosthesis is less likely to become unce-\nmented, so less hard cements or temporary cements may be \nused, which allows the restoration to be more easily removed \nwhen necessary (Fig. 16.60).\nEase of removing the prosthesis for abutment screw loos-\nening. If a prosthesis does become partially retained or an \nabutment screw becomes loose, a splinted restoration is much \neasier to remove than individual nonsplinted units. The \nimpact removal force to an individual crown is decreased by \nthe loose abutment screw. This results in dificulty in remov-\ning the crown and possible damage to the internal threads of \nthe implant body. In addition, attempting to engage a single \ncrown margin is often dificult for the crown remover, espe-\ncially when a subgingival margin is present. As a consequence, \nthe crown may need to be cut off and destroyed to gain access \nto the loose abutment screw. With a splinted prosthesis, a \ncrown remover is easily engaged into the interproximal space \nof the prosthesis.\nDecrease the risk of marginal bone loss because of better \nforce distribution.74 Splinted implants have less stress trans-\nmitted to the crestal marginal bone. Force distribution is \nmore beneicial with a splinted prosthesis; thus less force is \ntransmitted to the osseous tissue. Increased stress to the pros-\nthesis is related to marginal bone loss around an implant.\nDecrease the risk of porcelain fracture. Splinted crowns \nhave less risk of porcelain fracture. The marginal ridges (and \noften buccal mandibular cusps) of implant crowns are usually \nunsupported by the metal work. As a consequence, the load \non a marginal ridge is a shear load, with porcelain weakest to \nshear loads. In a report by Kinsel and Lin, porcelain fractures \noccurred in 35% of patients with implant crowns, especially \nwhen bruxing patients were restored in group function. \nSplinted implant crowns have the metal connectors of the \ncasting below the marginal ridges. The interproximal porce-\nlain has a compressive force on the porcelain, and porcelain \nis strongest to compressive loads.75\nDecrease the risk of abutment screw loosening. Splinted \nimplants reduce the risk of screw loosening. One of the \nFIG 16.59 A-P splint. (A–C) The mandible may have a square, \novoid, or tapering shape.

However, \ndistal to the foramina, the mandible exhibits considerable \nmovement toward the midline on opening.79 This movement \nis caused primarily by the attachment of internal pterygoid \nmuscles on the medial ramus of the mandible. The distortion \nof the mandible occurs early in the opening cycle, and the \nmaximum changes may occur with as little as 28% opening \n(or about 12 mm). This lexure has also been observed during \nprotrusive jaw movements.80 The greater the active opening \nand protrusive movements, the greater the amplitude of \nmandibular lexion. The amount of movement varies among \nindividuals and depends on the density and volume of bone \nand the location of the site in question. In general, the more \ndistal the sites, the more medial lexure. The amplitude of the \nmandibular body lexure toward the midline has been mea-\nsured to be as much as 800 µm in the irst molar–to–irst \nmolar region to as much as 1500 µm in the ramus-to-ramus \nsites (Fig. 16.61A).\nTorsion. Torsion of the mandibular body distal to the foram-\nina has also been documented in both animal and human \nstudies. Hylander evaluated larger members of the rhesus \nmonkey family (macaque) and found the mandible twisted \non the working side and bent in the parasagittal plane on the \nbalancing side during the power stroke of mastication and \nunilateral molar biting (Fig. 16.61B).81 Parasagittal bending \nof the human jaw during unilateral biting was conirmed by \nAbdel-Latif et al, who showed patients with implant prosthe-\nses measured up to 19 degrees of dorsoventral shear.82 \nThe torsion during parafunction is caused primarily by \nforceful contraction of the masseter muscle attachments \n(Fig. 16.62A). Parafunctional bruxism and clenching may \ncause torsion-related problems in the implant support system \nand prosthesis when the mandibular teeth are splinted from \nthe molar-to-molar regions.\nDecrease the risk of implant component fracture. Splinted \nimplants distribute less force to the implant bodies, which \ndecreases the risk of implant body fracture. In a report by \nSullivan and Siddiqui, a 4-mm single implant replacing a \nmolar had implant body fracture in 14% of the cases. In \ncomparison, multiple implants splinted together report a 1% \nimplant body fracture rate.3,77\nEasier to treat upon implant failure. When an indepen-\ndent implant fails, the implant most likely will need to be \nremoved, which usually indicates bone grafting prior to the \nreimplantation. This may require multiple surgeries over a \nlong time period with great expense to the clinician. In \ncontrast, when multiple crowns are splinted and an implant \nfails, the affected implant may often be removed and the \nimplant crown converted to a pontic using the same prosthe-\nsis. As a result, rather than several surgical and prosthetic \nprocedures over an extended period when independent units \nare restored, the problem may be solved in one relatively short \nappointment.\nMANDIBULAR FULL-ARCH \nSPLINTING—FLEXURE\nIn the mandible, full-arch splinting with implants distal to \nthe mental foramen may lead to signiicant complications \nwith the patient.

Prevention of mandibular lexure \nshould include the following treatment plans:\nBilateral Posterior Implants: If implants are positioned \nbilaterally in the premolar/molar regions of the man-\ndible, the inal prosthesis should be splinted with two \nsections. This will minimize the possibility of lexure/\ntorsion issues.\nAnterior Implants with Unilateral Implants Posterior: \nFull-arch splinted prostheses may be fabricated without \nconcern regarding lexure/torsion problems.\nAnterior Implants with No Posterior Implants: Full-arch \nsplinted prostheses may be fabricated without concern \nregarding lexure/torsion problems.\nTreatment\nIf a full-arch splinted prosthesis is fabricated and the patient \nexhibits complications related to the lexure/torsion of the \nmandible, the prosthesis needs to be remade or modiied so \nthat it is not fabricated in one piece (Fig. 16.62B).\nCONNECTING IMPLANTS TO TEETH\nPrior to 1988, many practitioners connected an implant to \none or two natural teeth. These implants were designed to \nhave either a ibrous tissue or a direct bone interface. When \nthe root form osseointegration concept of Brånemark for \nfull-arch edentulous ixed prostheses became more dominant \nin the mid-1980s, these implants came to be used in partially \nedentulous arches. It was hypothesized at the time that joining \na rigid implant to a natural tooth would cause biomechanical \ncomplications on the implant, implant prosthesis, or both. \nSince that time, several reports have indicated that a rigid \nimplant may be joined to a natural tooth in the same pros-\nthesis.83,84 In fact, implant-cantilevered prostheses in partial \nedentulous patients have more reported complications than \nwhen implants are joined to teeth.\nThere are more partially edentulous patients missing pos-\nterior teeth than anterior teeth. As a result, the most common \nscenario for which a root form implant may be joined to a \nnatural tooth is in the posterior regions. Of these cases, the \nmost common scenario is as a terminal abutment in a patient \nmissing the molars. For example, if a patient is missing the \nirst and second molars in a quadrant (with no third molar \npresent), the segment requires at least two implants of proper \nsize and design to independently restore these two teeth. If \nadequate bone exists in the second molar and distal half of \nthe irst molar but inadequate bone exists in the mesial half \nof the irst molar, a premolar-size pontic is required. The \npontic may be cantilevered from the anterior natural teeth or \nthe posterior implants. Either of these options may result in \nImplants placed in front of the foramina and splinted \ntogether or implants in one posterior quadrant joined to \nanterior implants have not shown these complications related \nto the lexure or torsion of the mandible. Complete implant-\nsupported ixed restorations can halt the posterior bone loss \nassociated with edentulism, improve psychologic health, and \nproduce fewer prosthetic complications than removable res-\ntorations. All edentulous mandibular patients should be \ngiven the option of having a ixed prosthesis.

The tooth exhibits normal physi-\nologic movements in vertical, horizontal, and rotational \ndirections. The amount of movement of a natural tooth is \nrelated to its surface area and root design.

The inherent \nlexibility matched the vertical mobility of the natural \ntooth. The minimal movement of the tooth and the fact \nthat implant, prosthesis, and abutment components have \nsome mobility indicate that the risk is small in the vertical \ndirection with the biomechanical difference of an implant \nand a tooth in the same prosthesis when one or two pontics \nseparate these units.90\nImplant Mobility. The implant-bone interface also exhibits \nlateral movement. Sekine et al evaluated the movement of \nendosteal implants with rigid ixation and found a range of \n12 to 66 µm of movement in the labiolingual direction.87 \nKomiyama measured 40 to 115 µm of implant movement in \nthe mesiodistal direction under a force of 2000 g (≈4.5 psi) \nand a labiolingual range of 11 to 66 mm (Fig. 16.68).91 The \ngreater implant movement in the mesiodistal dimension cor-\nresponds to the lack of cortical bone around the implants in \nthis direction compared with the thicker lateral cortical plates \npresent in the labiolingual dimension. The mobility of \nimplants varies in direct proportion to the load applied and \nthe bone density, which relects the elastic deformation of \nbone tissue.\nAlthough the implant has a range of mobility, the mobility \nis related to the viscoelastic component of bone, not the \nphysiologic aspect of a periodontal membrane. As such, when \nthe implant and tooth are loaded in the same prosthesis, the \ntooth immediately moves (primary tooth movement), and \nthen the tooth and implant move together. In other words, \nsecondary tooth movement is similar to implant movement \nbecause they both depend on the viscoelasticity of the bone. \nIn a study by Sekine et al, when a tooth was gradually loaded \nover a 2-second period, the tooth immediately moved 36 µm \nand then gradually moved an additional 6 µm. The implant \ngradually loaded had movement directly related to the \namount of load and eventually moved as much as 22 µm. The \nsecondary tooth movement was similar to the implant move-\nment (Fig. 16.69).87\nIn summary, when all factors are considered, an implant \nmoves vertically and horizontally, the abutments and pros-\nthesis lex, and the tooth has apical and lateral movements. \nHowever, the major difference in movement between implants \nand teeth is more related to the direction of movement (the \nhorizontal dimension is more compared to much less differ-\nence in the vertical dimension).\nPrevention/Treatment\nGuidelines for Joining Implants to Teeth\nNo lateral force on prosthesis.

The irst, and the option of choice, is to place \nadditional implants and to avoid the inclusion of natural \nabutments in the inal prosthesis.

The other option is to improve stress distribution by \nsplinting additional natural abutments until no clinical \nmobility of the splinted units is observed.\nRigid connectors are contraindicated. Implants should \nnot be joined to mobile teeth with rigid attachments, which \nbasically adds a cantilever on the implant (the tooth acting as \na living pontic).

A vertical move-\nment or force placed on a posterior implant joined to a \nhealthy posterior tooth causes mesial tension on the implant. \nThe implant can move vertically 3 to 5 µm and mesially 40 \nto 115 µm, and a noble metal–ixed prosthesis with one \npontic allows mesiodistal movement of 6 µm (Fig. 16.70). A \nnatural tooth with no clinical mobility could be connected \nrigidly to an osseointegrated implant with no lateral forces \nbecause the implant, bone, and prosthesis compensate for the \nslight tooth movement. Finite element, photoelastic, and \nclinical documentation conirm that implants can be con-\nnected rigidly to stable teeth.92 However, the occlusion should \nbe modiied to allow the initial occlusal contacts on the \nnatural tooth so that the implant does not bear the major \nportion of the initial load.93\nThe lateral mobility of healthy anterior incisor teeth often \nis recorded as (+) with a range of movement from 90 to \n108 µm.

When implants are joined to teeth \nthat act as a terminal abutment, a deinitive cement should \nbe used for the natural tooth. The tooth cannot intrude \nunless it becomes unretained from the abutment (or has a \nnonrigid connector between the units).\nReports of intrusion of the natural tooth connected to an \nimplant usually include the use of temporary cement to \nlute a coping to the natural abutment, leaving the inal resto-\nration uncemented on the coping, or the use of a nonrigid \nconnector.97\nA possible explanation for tooth intrusion may be that the \ntooth is pushed vertically 28 µm but wants to rebound only \n8 µm. The ixed prosthesis rebounds immediately and pulls \non the tooth. The cement seal eventually breaks, causing a \nspace to develop, which is irst occupied by air. The prosthesis \nthen acts as an orthodontic appliance and continually pushes \nthe tooth in a vertical direction. Eventually, the space is \noccupied by saliva, and hydraulics continue the downward \nforce during mastication. The tooth eventually submerges \nor intrudes from the prosthesis.\nIdeal, Favorable Conditions. An alternative may be to join \nthe implant(s) to a natural tooth if all other factors are favor-\nable. This treatment option is more likely in the presence of \na division C−h ridge in the pontic region when inadequate \nbone height adjacent to the natural tooth decreases the prog-\nnosis of a vertical bone graft. This option is also available \nwhen a posterior implant is positioned too distal to restore \nwith a single crown. It is almost always better to splint the \nimplant to the adjacent tooth rather than fabricating a can-\ntilevered crown from one implant, especially when parafunc-\ntion is present.\nNarrow-Diameter Implants. Another scenario in favor of this \ntreatment plan is when the posterior implants are of a narrower \ndiameter than usual. When two division B root forms are used \nin the posterior mandible to replace molars, there should be no \ncantilever to magnify the force on the implants. Posterior \npontics should not be cantilevered from even two splinted divi-\nsion B root form implants because they will have a greater \nbiomechanical risk. An additional root form implant or a \nnatural tooth is usually required as an abutment for the ixed \nprosthesis. When an additional implant insertion is not an \noption, the posterior implants may be joined by a rigid connec-\ntor (e.g., a solder joint) to a natural tooth or teeth within the \nprosthesis, provided all dental factors are favorable.\nINTRAOPERATIVE PROSTHODONTIC \nCOMPLICATIONS\nABUTMENT NOT SEATED\nIf an abutment is not fully seated within the implant, the \npreload placed on the screw will be insuficient. This will lead \nbreak the cement seal on the tooth. However, the rigid implant \nwill have greater stresses applied to the cement (or screw) \nretained crown. After the prosthesis is loose from the implant, \ngreater stress is applied to the natural mobile tooth. The \ntooth may increase in mobility as a result or fracture as a \nconsequence (especially when endodontic procedures were \nperformed) (Fig. 16.71).\nNonrigid connectors are contraindicated. A mobile attach-\nment between the implant and natural tooth is usually not a \nbeneit. A mobile attachment moves more than an implant or \na tooth. Therefore, it is not an “attachment.” The pontic is \ncantilevered from the implant with little to no support from \nthe tooth. It is usually better to have a rigid connector between \nimplants and teeth than a mobile attachment.\nAlthough nonrigid connectors have been advocated in the \nliterature, a nonrigid connector in a unilateral prosthesis rarely \nis indicated for implant-ixed prostheses and may be detrimen-\ntal.94 Nonrigid connection does not improve the stress distri-\nbution between the different abutments and has been reported \nto have caused migration of the natural teeth.95,96\nIf the nonrigid connector exhibits any clinically observed \nmobility, it moves more than the implant. As such, the \nimplant-supported part of the restoration is cantilevered to \nthe attachment.

The \nirst is not placing apical pressure on the top of the torque \nwrench. Failure to keep good apical pressure will lead to a \nshear force applied to the screw and/or stripping of the screw. \nSecondly, the torque wrench can be a signiicant lever arm. \nThus, the torque wrench should be used with short strokes. \nAnd lastly, the torque wrench should be replaced on a regular \nbasis and maintained in a good working condition. When \nautoclaving the torque wrench, make sure the wrench is in \nthe open position. This will reduce the possibility of excess \nresidue forming within the torque wrench assembly. Studies \nhave shown that, on average, clinicians use torque wrenches \nwith deviations of 10% or greater.

When placing torque on the screw, \ninsert the hex driver irst, then attach the torque driver to the \nhex driver. This will minimize the possibility of not having \nthe hex driver fully seated.\nTreatment\nThere are three possible treatment options to remove a \nstripped hex screw.\n1. Place and fully seat the hex driver into the hex screw \nhead. With an osteotome or mirror handle, lightly tap \nthe hex drive to fully seat the driver into the hex. Ideally, \na new hex driver should be used.\n2. Add a small amount of autopolymerizing acrylic (GC \nPattern Resin) onto the tip of the hex driver. Seat the \nhex driver into the hex screw head.

Soft tissue–borne prostheses \nhave the least impact force because the gingival tissues are \nresilient.\nThe manner in which forces are applied to implant resto-\nrations within the oral environment dictates the likelihood of \nsystem failure. The duration of a force may affect the ultimate \noutcome of an implant system. Relatively low-magnitude \nforces, applied repetitively over a long time, may result in \nfatigue failure of an implant or prosthesis. Stress concentra-\ntions and, ultimately, failure may develop if insuficient cross-\nsectional area is present to dissipate high-magnitude forces \nadequately. If a force is applied some distance away from a \nweak link in an implant or prosthesis, then bending or tor-\nsional failure may result from moment loads. An understand-\ning of force delivery and failure mechanisms is critically \nimportant to the implant practitioner to avoid costly and \npainful complications.\nMOMENT LOADS\nThe moment of a force about a point tends to produce rota-\ntion or bending about that point. A moment force is deined \nas a vector (M) (vectors are described in terms of magnitude \nand direction) the magnitude of which equals the product of \nthe force magnitude multiplied by the perpendicular distance \n(also called the moment arm) from the point of interest to the \nline of action of the force. This imposed moment load also is \nreferred to as a torque or torsional load and may be destructive \nto the implant system (Fig. 16.83).\nA total of six moments (rotations) may develop about the \nthree clinical coordinate axes previously described (occlu-\nsoapical, faciolingual, and mesiodistal axes). Such moment \nloads induce microrotations and stress concentrations at the \ncrest of the alveolar ridge at the implant-tissue interface, \nwhich lead inevitably to crestal bone loss (Fig. 16.84).\nThree clinical moment arms exist in implant dentistry: (1) \nocclusal height, (2) cantilever length, and (3) occlusal width. \nMinimization of each of these moment arms is necessary to \nprevent unretained restorations, fracture of components, \ncrestal bone loss, and complete implant system failure.\nOcclusal Height\nThe occlusal height serves as the moment arm for force com-\nponents directed along the faciolingual axis working or bal-\nancing occlusal contacts, tongue thrusts, or in passive loading \nby cheek and oral musculature, as well as force components \ndirected along the mesiodistal axis.\nIn division A bone, initial moment load at the crest is less \nthan in division C or D bone because the crown height is \ngreater in division C and D bone.

Offset occlusal contacts or lateral loads, however, intro-\nduce signiicant moment arms.\nCantilever Length\nLarge moments may develop from vertical axis force compo-\nnents in prosthetic environments designed with cantilever \nextensions or offset loads from rigidly ixed implants. A lingual \nforce component also may induce a twisting moment about \nthe implant neck axis if applied through a cantilever length.\nAn implant with a cantilevered mesobar extending 1, 2, and \n3 cm has signiicant ranges of moment loads. A 100-N force \napplied directly over the implant does not induce a moment \nload or torque because no rotational forces are applied through \nan offset distance. This same 100-N force applied 1 cm from \nthe implant results in a 100 N-cm moment load. Similarly, if \nthe load is applied 2 cm from the implant, a 200 N-cm torque \nis applied to the implant-bone region, and at 3 cm, a 300 N-cm \nmoment load results. For comparison, recall that implant abut-\nments typically are tightened with 30 N-cm of torque.\nOcclusal Width\nWide occlusal tables increase the moment arm for any offset \nocclusal loads. Faciolingual tipping (rotation) can be reduced \nsigniicantly by narrowing the occlusal tables or adjusting the \nocclusion to provide more centric contacts.\nIn summary, a vicious, destructive cycle can develop with \nmoment loads and result in crestal bone loss. As crestal bone \nloss develops, occlusal height automatically increases. With \nan increased occlusal height moment arm, the faciolingual \nmicrorotation and rocking increase and cause even more \nstress to the crestal bone. Unless the bone increases in density \nand strength, the cycle continues to spiral toward implant \nfailure if the biomechanical environment is not corrected \n(Fig. 16.85).\nNOT UTILIZING IMPLANT-PROTECTED \nOCCLUSION\nEtiology\nA proper occlusal scheme is a primary requisite for long-term \nimplant prosthetic survival, especially when parafunction or \na marginal foundation is present. A poor occlusal scheme \nincreases the magnitude of loads and intensiies mechanical \nstresses (and strain) to the implant system. These factors \nincrease the frequency of complications of the prosthesis and \nbone support. Crestal bone loss may lead to anaerobic sulcus \ndepths and peri-implant disease states. These conditions may \nalso cause tissue shrinkage and loss of interdental papillae \nand poor esthetic conditions. All of these complications may \nbe caused by biomechanical stress as a result of occlusal loads \n(functional or parafunctional).\nPrevention\nThe implant-protective occlusion (IPO) concept refers to an \nocclusal plan speciically designed for the restoration of \nendosteal implants, providing an environment for reduced \nbiomechanical complications and improved clinical longev-\nity of both the implant and prosthesis.93 The biomechanical \nrationale for this concept was published by the author after \nlong-term clinical evaluation and biomechanical studies (and \nwas originally called medial-positioned, lingualized occlu-\nsion). This concept was speciically designed for ixed pros-\ntheses in either partial or complete edentulous patients. \nClinical considerations for this concept are drawn from basic \nprosthetic concepts, bone biomechanical principles, and \ninite element analyses to reduce noxious occlusal loads and \nestablish a consistent occlusal philosophy.\nA primary goal of an occlusal scheme is to maintain the \nocclusal load that has been transferred to the implant system \nwithin the physiologic and biomechanical limits of each \npatient. These limits are not identical for all patients or restora-\ntions. The forces generated by a patient are inluenced by \nranges of parafunction, masticatory dynamics, implant arch \nposition and location, arch form, and crown height. The treat-\nment plan philosophy for dental implants varies greatly and \ndepends on these several parameters. The clinician can address \nthese force factors best by selecting the proper position, \nnumber, and implant size, increasing bone density when neces-\nsary by progressive bone loading and selecting the appropriate \nocclusal scheme using stress-relieving design elements.\nThe IPO principles for ixed prostheses address several \nconditions to decrease stress to the implant system, including \nexisting occlusion, implant body angle to occlusal load, cusp \nangle of implant crowns, mutually protected articulation, \ncantilever or offset loads, crown height, crown contour, \nocclusal contact position, timing of occlusal contacts, and \nprotection of the weakest component (Box 16.5).\nOCCLUSAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR FIXED \nIMPLANT PROSTHESES\nInitial Evaluation\nMany clinicians begin to evaluate the occlusion of the patient \nwhen the inal implant prosthesis is delivered to the patient. \nHowever, this time frame is often too late to properly restore \nBOX 16.5 Implant-Protective \nOcclusion Principles\n• No premature occlusal contacts or interferences\n• Mutually protected articulation\n• Implant body positioned perpendicular to occlusal load\n• Narrow cusp angle of crowns (cuspal inclination)\n• Minimize cantilever or offset loads\n• Minimize crown height (vertical offset)\n• Ideal implant crown contour\n• Ideal occlusal contact positions\n• Ideal timing of occlusal contacts\n• Protect the weakest component (i.e arch)\n• Long, wide contact area"

Its relationship to CR (a neu-\nromuscular position independent of tooth contact with the \ncondyles in an anterior, superior position) is noteworthy to \nthe restoring dentist. The potential need for occlusal adjust-\nments to eliminate delective tooth contacts as the mandible \ncloses in CR and the evaluation of their potential noxious \neffects on the existing dentition and the planned restoration \nis important to evaluate.\nCorrection of the delective contacts before treatment pre-\nsents many advantages and may follow a variety of approaches"

The crowns with 100-µm pre-\nmature contacts had little bone changes. The 180-µm group \ndemonstrated a V-shaped pattern of bone loss for several \nmillimeters. The 250-µm implant crowns for 4 weeks had a \nlarge V-shaped defect around the implants that extended for \nmore than two thirds of the implant body. The implant is \nrigid, and the premature implant load cannot be released by \nincreased mobility or occlusal material wear as with a natural \ntooth.102 The premature contact on an implant system con-\ntributes to a higher risk of early abutment screw loosening, \nporcelain fracture, early loading failure, and crestal bone loss.\nThe elimination of premature occlusal contacts is espe-\ncially important when habitual parafunction is present \nbecause the duration and magnitude of occlusal forces are \nincreased. The elimination of premature contacts is more \ncritical than in natural teeth because of the lack of proprio-\nception and the implant’s inability to move and dissipate the \nforces. Because of increased proprioception, an initial prema-\nture occlusal contact on a tooth often affects the closure of \nthe mandible to result in an MI position different from CO. \nA premature contact on an implant crown does not beneit \nfrom such protective features. As a result, the implant system \nis at increased risk. Therefore, occlusal evaluation in CO and \nMI and adjustment as necessary in partially edentulous \nimplant patients is more critical than in natural dentition \nbecause the premature contacts can result in more damaging \nconsequences on implants compared with teeth (Fig. 16.86).33\ndepending on the severity of the incorrect tooth position: \nselective odontoplasty (a subtractive technique), restoration \nwith a crown (with or without endodontic therapy), or extrac-\ntion of the offending tooth. The existing occlusion is best \nevaluated with facebow-mounted diagnostic casts on an artic-\nulator mounted with an open-mouth bite registration in CR.\nControversy exists as to the necessity to have MI harmoni-\nous with CO (CR occlusion). A vast majority of patients do \nnot have such a relationship, yet they do not exhibit clinical \npathology or accelerated tooth loss. It is dificult to state that \nthese two positions must be similar. However, it is important \nto evaluate the existing occlusion and the mandibular excur-\nsions to decide whether the existing situation should be mod-\niied or be maintained. In other words, clinicians should \ndetermine whether they are going to ignore or control the \nocclusion of the patient.\nAs a general rule, the more teeth replaced or restored, the \nmore likely the patient is restored to CO. For example, if a \ncompletely edentulous mandible is to be restored with an \nimplant-supported ixed prosthesis, CO provides consistency \nand reproducibility between the articulator and the intraoral \ncondition. The slight changes in occlusal vertical dimension \n(OVD) and its relationship to the position of anterior implant \nabutments to the direction of force may be studied and \nimplemented on the articulator without the need to record a \nnew occlusal vertical position on the patient. On the other \nhand, when one anterior tooth is being replaced, the existing \nMI position is often satisfactory to restore the patient even \nthough a posterior interference and anterior slide into full \ninterdigitation may be present (with little clinical variance \nfrom the ideal conditions). However, in a partially edentulous \npatient, the existing occlusion should be evaluated to deter-\nmine if noxious conditions are present.\nPremature Occlusal Contacts\nA fundamental biomechanical formula is stress equals force \ndivided by the area over which the force is applied (S = F/A). \nDuring either maximum intercuspation or CO, no occlusal \ncontacts should be premature, especially on an implant-\nsupported crown. Premature occlusal contacts often result in \nlocalized lateral loading of the opposing contacting crowns.101 \nBecause the surface area of a premature contact is small, the \nmagnitude of stress in the bone increases proportionately (i.e., \nS = F/A). All of the occlusal force is applied to one region rather \nthan being shared by several abutments and teeth. In addition, \nbecause the premature contact is most often on an inclined \nplane, the horizontal component of the load increases the \nshear crestal stresses and the overall amount of stress to the \nentire implant system. The occlusal porcelain, the abutment \nscrew, and the cement retaining the crown are all at increased \nrisk because shear loads render more complications.\nThis is a general criterion for natural teeth, but the concept \nis much more important on implant prostheses with their \nhigher impact force and less occlusal awareness for the several \nreasons previously addressed. Myata et al evaluated prema-\nture contacts on implant crowns in monkeys (Macaca fascicu-\nlaris). The crestal bone was histologically evaluated on \nFIG 16.86 Premature occlusal contacts (i.e. implant prosthe-\nsis occluding prior to natural teeth) are detrimental to the \nimplant leading to possible bone loss or implant fracture."

From the level of the crest \nof the ridge to the occlusal plane, the implant abutment looks \nsimilar to one in an axial implant body. The laboratory tech-\nnician and restoring dentist often treat the angled implant \nand axial implant in similar fashion. However, in the 15-degree \nangled implant body, the load to the facial bone increases by \n25.9% compared with an axial load (Fig. 16.88). If the implant \nsurgeon places the implant body with a 30-degree angulation, \nthe buccal force component of any occlusal load will result in \na 50% increase of the load applied to the facial bone.93\nThe risk of crestal bone loss is increased with an angled \nimplant. In addition, the greater force is applied to most of the \nimplant system. The occlusal porcelain may be loaded in the \nlong axis with the angled abutment, but the abutment screw \nloosening and implant component fracture risks increase in \ndirect comparison to the load applied to the bone. Although \nthe restoring dentist may place a 30-degree angled abutment \nand restore the case similar to the axial implant, the conditions \nand risks of early loading failure, crestal bone loss, and loose \nabutment screws are dramatically different (Fig. 16.89).\nForce Direction and Bone Mechanics\nThe noxious effect of offset or angled loads to bone is exac-\nerbated further because of the anisotropy of bone. Anisotropy \nrefers to the character of bone whereby its mechanical prop-\nerties, including ultimate strength, depend on the direction \nin which the bone is loaded and the type of force applied. For \nexample, cortical bone of human long bones has been \nreported as strongest in compression, 30% weaker in tension, \nand 65% weaker in shear.103 Porcelain, titanium components, \nand cements are also weakest to shear components of a load. \nIPO attempts to eliminate or reduce all shear loads to the \nimplant system because the bone, porcelain, titanium com-\nponents, and cement are weakest to shear loads.\nAny occlusal load applied at an angle to the implant body \nmay be separated into normal (compressive and tensile) and \nshear forces. As the angle of load to an implant body increases, \nthe amount of compressive and tensile forces is modiied by \nthe cosine of the angle. Hence, the force is slightly reduced. \nHowever, the angled component of force is a shear force, and \nthe shear force is the amount of force times the sine of the \nload, which considerably increases the load. The force the \nbone observes is the sum of the compressive, tensile, and \nshear forces. For example, a 100-N force applied at 12 degrees \noff-axis will increase the total force to the bone by 100 N × \ncosine 12 degrees = 97.81 N + 100 N × sine 12 degrees = 20.79 \nN. The total force is 97.81 N + 20.79 N = 118.60 N (or almost \na 20% increase in total force). The greater the angle of load \nto the implant long axis, the greater the compressive, tensile, \nand shear stresses (Fig. 16.90).\nIn inite element analysis, when the direction of the force \nchanges to a more angled or horizontal load, the magnitude \nof the stress is increased by three times or more.104 In addi-\ntion, rather than a primarily compressive type of force, tensile \nand shear components are increased more than tenfold com-\npared with the axial force. In a photoelastic block with \nImplant Body Orientation\nForces acting on teeth and dental implants are referred to as \nvectors (deined in magnitude and direction). Occlusal forces \nare typically three dimensional, with components directed \nalong one or more of the clinical coordinate axes. The primary \nforces of occlusion can be resolved into a combination of \ncomponents in any given plane. The same magnitude of force \ncan have dramatically different effects on the implant system \nsolely because of the direction of the applied load. This is \nespecially noted on implant support systems because they are \nmore rigid. Teeth are naturally designed primarily for long-\naxis loads. The natural tooth roots in the majority of the \nmouth are perpendicular to the curves of Wilson and Spee. \nAlthough chewing is in an elliptical “tear drop” pattern, when \nthe teeth inally contact, the forces are in the long axis of the \nroots, especially during power biting (Fig. 16.87). The apical \nmovement of teeth is minimal compared with their lateral \nmovement. The maxillary anterior teeth receive a lateral load. \nThe consequences of a lateral force to a tooth are reduced \nbecause of the increased tooth mobility, which decreases the \neffects of the lateral force component of a load.\nAn axial load over the long axis of an implant body gener-\nates less overall stress and a greater proportion of compressive \nstress compared with an angled force to the implant body. \nWhen an implant body is loaded along its long axis, a 100-N \nforce results with an axial force component of 100 N, and no \nlateral force component is observed. The implant body should \nbe positioned perpendicular to the curves of Wilson and \nSpee, just as with natural teeth.\nMost anatomic variations of the bone (e.g., bony concavi-\nties) are located on the facial aspect and inluence implant \nbody inclination. An implant body may be positioned with a \n15-degree angle to avoid the facial concavity and, therefore, \nis positioned at 15 degrees to the occlusal load.

IPO attempts \nto eliminate lateral or angled loads to an implant-supported \nprosthesis because the magnitude of the force increases and \nthe strength of the bone decreases.\nIn conclusion, the microstrain of the crestal bone is \nincreased with an angled load and may shift from an axial \nload within physiologic limits to an angled load in the patho-\nlogic overload zone and, as a consequence, result in bone loss. \nThe greater force, especially in shear, is generated to the entire \nimplant system. The occlusal porcelain is weaker to shear and \nmay fracture, the cement that retains the prosthesis is weakest \nto shear and may become unretained, the abutment screw \nmore likely becomes loose with shear loads, the crestal bone \nregion may resorb, and implant components fracture more \noften with higher shear loads. When shear forces are increased \nwith an angled load to the implant system, an attempt should \nbe made to reduce the negative effect of angled loads.106\nThe primary component of the occlusal force should be \ndirected along the long axis of the implant body, not at an \nangle or following an angled abutment post. Angled abut-\nments should be used only to improve the path of insertion \nof the prosthesis or improve the inal esthetic result. The \nangled abutment, which is loaded along the abutment axis, \ntransmits a signiicant moment load (i.e., tending to rotate or \nrock the implant) to the entire implant system.\nProsthetic Angled Loads\nGreater crestal bone strains with angled forces have been \nconirmed with photoelastic and three-dimensional inite \nelement analysis methods. Whether the occlusal load is \napplied to an angled implant body or an angled load (e.g., \npremature contact on an angled cusp) is applied to an implant \nbody perpendicular to the occlusal plane, the results are \nsimilar (Fig. 16.92). A biomechanical risk to the implant \nsystem increases.\nThe implant surgeon may place the implant body ideally, \nperpendicular to the occlusal plane, yet the restoring dentist \nthen may load the implant crown at an angle. Similar noxious \nforces are increased in shear, and a decrease in bone strength \noccurs to the crestal bone, as well as an increase of shear loads \non implant components and the abutment screws. An angled \nload at a 45-degree angle on the same implant design, the \ncompressive stress may increase to 14,000 psi (96.6 MPa), \nand on the opposite side, tensile stress may increase to \n4000 psi (27.6 MPa). The compressive stresses are tripled, \nand the tensile stress increases 1000-fold with a load from a \n45-degree angle.\nThe stress contours in the bone simulant of the three-\ndimensional studies resemble the clinical pattern of early \ncrestal bone loss on implants. Not only does the magnitude \nof stress increase under angled loads, but it also evolves into \na more noxious shear component, which is more conducive \nto bone loss and screw loosening.105 The greater the angle of \nthe force, the greater the shear component. Bone is 65% \nweaker to shear load. The amount of the force increases, and \nthe strength of the bone decreases. It has been reported that \nangled occlusal forces decrease the ability of successful bone \nrepair on natural teeth. It may also impair successful bone \nremodeling around an implant.\nNot only is the bone weakest to shear loads but forces \napplied at an angle to the bone also further affect the physi-\nologic limit of compressive and tensile strengths of bone. A \nforce applied at a 30-degree angle may decrease the bone \nstrength limits by 10% under compression and 25% with \ntension (Table 16.5). A 60-degree force angle reduces the \nstrength 30% under compression and 55% under tension. \nNot only does the crestal bone load increase around the \nimplant with angled forces but also the amount of stress the \nbone may withstand (i.e., the ultimate strength) decreases in \nFIG 16.91 A photoelastic study of opposing implants in a \nmaxilla and mandible.

Of the three options, increas-\ning the implant number is most effective to reduce overall \nstress to the system.108 In addition, a greater number of \nimplants also has more retention for the restoration.\nThe restoring dentist may reduce the overload risk by (1) \nsplinting the implants together, (2) reducing the occlusal load \non the second implant and further reducing the load on the \nthird implant, and (3) eliminating all lateral or horizontal \nloads from the most angled implant and completely eliminat-\ning them in all posterior regions.\nThe anterior mandible (with a force magnitude similar to \nthe anterior maxilla) often has the implant body positioned \nperpendicular to the occlusal plane and restored with a \nstraight abutment. In the anterior maxilla, even under ideal \nconditions, the implant should be angled away from the labial \nbone and results with the abutment toward the facial crown \ncontour. An angled prosthetic abutment is required, and \nthese implant bodies are more frequently loaded at an angle. \nIn fact, maxillary anterior teeth are usually loaded at a 12- to \n15-degree angle to the occlusal plane.\nThe natural dentition reduces the increased stress to the \nmaxilla by increasing the size of the roots compared with \nmandibular incisors and increasing the mobility of the tooth. \nIn the maxilla, a larger-diameter implant or a greater number \nof implants are indicated to minimize the crestal bone stress \non each abutment, especially in patients exhibiting severe \nbruxism. Ridge augmentation may be necessary before \nimplant placement to improve implant position or facilitate \nthe use of a wider-diameter implant. IPO aims at reducing \nthe force of occlusal contacts, increasing the implant number, \nor increasing the implant diameter for implants subjected to \nangled loads.\nimplant body or an angled load on the implant crown \nincreases the amount of crestal stresses on the implant system, \ntransforms a greater percentage of the force to shear force, \nand reduces bone, porcelain, and cement strength. In con-\ntrast, the surrounding implant system stress magnitude is \nleast, and the strength of bone, porcelain, and cement is great-\nest under a load axial to the implant body and perpendicular \nto the occlusal plane. All of these factors mandate the reduc-\ntion of angled forces to the implant system (Fig. 16.93).\nMost implant bodies inserted at an angle of greater than \n12 degrees to the occlusal plane require an angled abutment. \nThe surgeon and restoring dentist should understand that \nangled abutments are fabricated in two pieces and are weaker \nin design than a two-piece straight abutment without an \nangle. Because less metal lanks the abutment screw on one \nside of an angled abutment, it is at more risk of fracture or \nis less able to be reduced in width for ideal crown contours. \nFurthermore, a larger transverse load component develops at \nthe abutment screw and crest of the ridge as a result of angled \nloads and increases the risk of abutment screw loosening. In \na study by Ha et al, the angled abutment was compared with \na straight abutment for screw loosening in the anterior \nmaxilla. The angled abutments showed more screw loosening \nwith cyclic loading than the straight abutments.107\nSolutions to Angled Loads\nWhen lateral or angled loads cannot be eliminated, a reduc-\ntion in the force magnitude or additional surface area of \nimplant support is indicated to reduce the risk of biome-\nchanical complications to the implant system. For example, \nFIG 16.92 When an angled load is placed on an implant body, \nthe compressive stresses on the opposite side of the implant \nincrease and the tensile and shear loads on the same side of \nthe implant increase. Because bone is weaker to tensile and \nshear forces, the risks to the bone are increased for two \nreasons: (1) the amount of the stress increases, and (2) the \ntype of stress is changed to more tensile and shear condi-\ntions.

When the initial \ntooth movement occurs, secondary tooth movement is \npresent during a greater load and relects the viscoelastic \nproperty of the surrounding bone. The vertical secondary \ntooth movement is minimal and may approach 3 to 5 µm for \na natural tooth.\nThe secondary tooth movement is similar to the bone-\nimplant movement. In other words, the initial axial move-\nment during a light bite force of an implant has no initial, \nsudden movement. Contrary to the teeth that move immedi-\nately, even with light loads, implants only move under a heavy \nocclusal load and even under these conditions have almost \nno mobility. The implant may move up to 5 µm after addi-\ntional force causes the bone to deform, with little correlation \nof movement to the implant body length.87 In fact, the mobil-\nity of implant “secondary” movement is more related to bone \ndensity than any other factor.\nWhen teeth oppose each other, the combined intrusive \nmovements of the contacting elements may be 56 µm (28 + \n28 µm). When a tooth opposes an implant, the initial com-\nbined intrusive movement is only 28 µm (28 + 0 µm). In \nother words, when implant prostheses oppose natural teeth, \nthe difference in movement between teeth in the rest of the \nmouth and the implants causes a condition with greater loads \nto the implant.\nPrevention/Treatment\nArticulation Protocol\n1. The clinician should irst evaluate the existing occlusion \nbefore implant reconstruction and ideally eliminate occlu-\nsal prematurities on teeth before the inal evaluation of the \nocclusion for the implant reconstruction.\n2. At the delivery of the implant prosthesis, any premature \ncontact on the implant restoration should be eliminated. \nIt is interesting to note that a coating of petroleum jelly \non the articulating paper will help release the dye and \nallow more precise occlusal contact identiication on the \nteeth and implant restoration (Fig. 16.94). After this step, \nOCCLUSAL CONTACT TIMING\nMost commonly, clinicians use subjective methods when \nevaluating and determining occlusal contact. This may often \nlead to false-positive or negative results because of the use of \ndental anesthesia, the subjective nature of the method, and \nquestionable awareness of contact timing.\nEtiology\nOcclusal Awareness. Jacobs and van Steenberghe evalu-\nated patient occlusal awareness by the perception of an inter-\nference. When teeth oppose each other, an interference is \nperceived at approximately 20 µm. An implant opposing a \nnatural tooth detects an interference at 48 µm; this detection \nis more than twice as poor. An implant crown opposing an \nimplant crown perceives the interference at 64 µm, and when \na tooth opposes an implant overdenture, the awareness is \n108 µm (ive times poorer than teeth opposing each other).109 \nMericske-Stern et al measured oral tactile sensitivity with \nsteel foils. The detection threshold of minimal pressure was \nsigniicantly higher on implants than on natural teeth (3.2 vs. \n2.6 foils).110 Similar indings also were reported by Hammerle \net al in which the mean threshold value for implants (100.6 g) \nwas 8.75 times higher than that of natural teeth (11.5 g).111 \nAn occlusal adjustment performed by occlusal awareness—\n“How does the bite feel? Is the implant crown high?”—is a \npoor indicator for hyper contacts compared with a crown on \na natural tooth. As a consequence of decreased quantity and \nquality of occlusal awareness, a premature occlusal contact \nmay remain on an implant crown after occlusal adjustment.\nThe biomechanical concern for the difference in tooth \nmovement and implant movement should not be restricted \nto situations in which these entities are directly connected \nwithin the same prosthesis. When an implant is placed in a \npartially edentulous arch, many similar biomechanical ele-\nments are present, whether the teeth are splinted to the \nimplant or are independent.\nInherent Laboratory Error. The laboratory cannot equili-\nbrate the occlusion accurately on the working casts. The tech-\nnician taps two stone casts together to evaluate the occlusal \ncontacts. The stone dies do not move 28 to 108 µm. As a \nresult, the occlusal adjustment in the mouth compensates for \nthe primary and secondary tooth movement. When a heavy \nbite force occlusal adjustment is not performed at the delivery \nof an implant crown, the dentist may not be aware that the \nimplant may be overloaded similar to a new crown on a \nnatural tooth that has not been equilibrated in the mouth.\nTooth vs. Implant Movement. The sudden, initial (primary) \ntooth movement ranges from 8 to 28 µm in a vertical direc-\ntion under a 3- to 5-lb load, depending on the size, number, \nand geometry of the roots and the time elapsed since the last \nload application.86 This tooth movement has been called \n“primary” tooth movement and is a result of the movement \nwithin the periodontal complex. An implant has no initial or \nprimary vertical tooth movement. An implant with a heavy \nFIG 16.94 Petroleum jelly applied to articulating paper helps \nrelease the dye and makes the occlusal marks more speciic. \n(From Misch CE: Dental implant prosthetics, ed 2, St Louis, \n2015, Mosby.)"

To evaluate these occlusal contacts, a full-arch artic-\nulating paper is required.\nImplant Prostheses Opposing Each Other. When implant \nprostheses oppose each other unilaterally, the heavy bite force \nocclusal adjustment must account for a 56-µm difference in \nvertical movement between the opposing implant crowns \nand the rest of the natural teeth. The light bite force occlusal \nadjustment should again be performed with a full-arch-size \narticulating paper, and the implant-implant section should \nbarely contact, but the tooth-tooth anterior and posterior \nsections have more occlusal contact. Under a heavy bite force \nin occlusion, similar occlusal contacts are present on both \nsides of the arch.\nComplete Implant-Supported Prosthesis. A complete-arch \nimplant-supported prosthesis in one arch opposing complete \nnatural teeth does not require a difference in a light and heavy \nbite force occlusal evaluation. Likewise, when implants \nsupport both maxillary and mandibular prostheses, a light \nand heavy bite force difference in occlusal timing is not \nrequired.\nMaxillary Anterior. When anterior teeth disocclude the \nposterior teeth in excursions, the lateral tooth movement of \nthe posterior teeth (56–73 µm) does not have to be accounted \nfor because no lateral force exists. Because anterior teeth and \nimplants have lateral movement during mandibular excur-\nsion that results in greater discrepancies, the occlusal adjust-\nment in this direction is more critical to the implant system. \nthe clinician uses thin articulating paper (less than 25-µm \nthickness tin foil) for the initial implant occlusal adjust-\nment in occlusion under a light tapping force (Fig. 16.95). \nThe implant prosthesis should barely contact during this \nlight bite force, and the surrounding teeth in the arch \nshould exhibit greater initial occlusal contacts. In other \nwords, only light axial occlusal contacts should be present \non the implant crown.\n3. After the equilibration, when a light bite force is com-\npleted, the patient applies a heavier occlusal force and \ngrinds on the articulating paper (Fig. 16.96). A plastic \narticulatory paper is a beneit, so the “paper” will not tear \nduring the heavy bite and grind force on the teeth (e.g., \n20 µm, Accuilm; Parkell, Farmingdale, NY). The occlusal \ncontact point on the implant crown should remain axial \nover the implant body and may be of similar intensity on \nthe implant crown and the adjacent teeth. When greater \nbite forces are used, all of the occlusal elements react \nsimilar under the heavy occlusal load. To harmonize the \nocclusal forces between implants and teeth, the dentist \nevaluates a heavy bite force occlusal adjustment because it \ndepresses the natural teeth, positioning them closer to the \nless depressed implant position, and permits equal sharing \nof the occlusal load.45\nOcclusal Contact in One Quadrant. When all posterior \nteeth in one quadrant of the same arch are implant sup-\nported, the same occlusal timing is suggested. Under a light \nbite force, the occlusal contacts between the anterior and \nposterior teeth on the opposite side are slightly heavier in \ncentric occlusion than the implant prosthesis. Under a heavy \nFIG 16.95 A light occlusal force is applied irst to the implant \nand teeth. The irst molar implant crown has less initial \ncontact than the teeth.

The implant crown in this patient needs \nto be adjusted because the occlusal markings on the lingual \ncusps and marginal ridge are offset loads.

Maxillary \nposterior teeth often have reduced occlusal tables from the \npalatal aspect because the buccal cusp is often within the \nesthetic zone (Fig. 16.98).\nA buccal or lingual cantilever in the posterior regions is \ncalled an offset load, and the same principles of force magni-\nication from class 1 levers apply. In other words, the greater \nthe offset, the greater the load to the implant system.112 \nOffset loads may also result from buccal or lingual occlusal \ncontacts and create moment forces, which increase compres-\nsive, tensile, and shear forces to the entire implant system \n(Fig. 16.99).\nThe clinician will irst use light force and thin articulating \npaper to ensure that little to no implant crown contact occurs \nduring the initial occlusal or lateral movement of the teeth. \nA heavier force during CO and excursions to develop similar \nocclusal contacts on anterior implants and natural teeth \nshould then be completed.\nTo compensate for the difference in 100 µm of horizontal \nmovement between maxillary anterior implants and anterior \nteeth, two modiications are required. The irst is to enamelo-\nplasty the facial incisal contact of the mandibular incisal edge. \nThe patient is told the height of the tooth is not reduced, only \nthe facial incisal edge. Very often, when a maxillary anterior \ntooth is lost, the opposing mandibular incisor shifts to the \nfacial and makes the implant position and occlusal adjust-\nment more critical. The second modiication is often that the \nlingual contour of a maxillary anterior crown is more concave \nthan a natural tooth to accommodate the heavy bite force \nocclusal adjustment (Fig. 16.97).\nThe proposed heavy bite force occlusal adjustment does \nnot encourage tooth migration or changes in tooth position \nbecause regular occlusal contacts still occur. The teeth oppos-\ning implants are not taken out of occlusion. Brief occlusal \ncontacts on a daily basis maintain the tooth in its original \nposition (similar to the rest of the mouth). In addition, \nbecause most teeth in a skeletal class I occlusion occlude with \ntwo opposing teeth (with the exception of the mandibular \ncentral incisor), the opposing teeth positions are even more \nlikely to remain the same. In other words, the two opposing \nnatural teeth to an implant crown still have occlusal contacts \non the adjacent natural teeth to the implant. However, teeth \ndo move over time. Unlike teeth, implants do not extrude, \nrotate, or migrate under occlusal forces. As such, the restoring \ndentist may vary the intensity of the force applied to an \nimplant without causing the implant to change its position \nreadily in the bone. On the contrary, natural teeth do exhibit \nmesial drift, and slight changes in occlusal position do occur \nover time.\nTreatment\nRecall Examination. No occlusal scheme will prevent mesial \ndrift and minor tooth movement from occurring. In addi-\ntion, enamel may wear approximately 30 µm each year. An \nintegral part of the implant-protected occlusion philosophy \nis the regular evaluation and control of occlusal contacts at \neach regularly scheduled hygiene appointment. This permits \nthe correction of minor variations occurring during long-\nterm function and helps prevent porcelain fracture and other \nstress-related complications (abutment screw loosening) on \nthe implant prostheses.\nOCCLUSAL TABLE TOO LARGE\nEtiology\nThe occlusal table of the crown should also be modiied in \nnonesthetic regions to conform to the implant size and posi-\ntion and to direct vertical forces to the implant body. For \nexample, posterior mandibular implant-supported prostheses \nFIG 16.97 (A) The occlusal equilibration of an anterior implant \ncrown is made irst with a light occlusal contact in centric \nocclusion (CO) and during mandibular excursions.

The reduced \nbuccal contour in the posterior mandible is of no conse-\nquence to cheek biting because the buccal horizontal overjet \nis maintained (and increased). The lingual contour of \nthe mandibular implant crown is similar to a natural tooth \n(Fig. 16.101).

The inal tissue heights \nof the papillae and gingival margins are ultimately dictated \nby the posthealing levels, type of abutment, and position of \nthe interproximal and facial bone. Special emergence proile \nabutments are often advocated by the manufacturers; \nhowever, this is usually not necessary because the emergence \nproile can be developed with the restoration on a stock \nabutment.\nModiication of Soft Tissue. The easiest technique to \nachieve the emergence proile is to sculpture the peri-implant \nmucosa with the use of a provisional prosthesis. This is most \nsuccessful with a thick biotype tissue because it may be easily \nmanipulated. With a thin biotype, there is a high risk of soft \ntissue collapse and gingival recession.\nLaboratory. The emergence proile can sometimes be \nimproperly fabricated based on a inal cast with nonideal soft \ntissue foundation. The dental technician should model an \nimplant-supported prosthesis with an ideal emergence proile \n(Fig. 16.110).\nBecause of its characteristics, the peri-implant mucosa can \nbe modiied by a sculpting process based on the principle that \nsoft tissue becomes modiiable after controlled, constant \ncompression. Especially in patients with a thick gingival \nbiotype, this tissue can be manipulated to reproduce the \nnormal scalloped, parabolic gingival contours. Different \napproaches have been suggested by the current literature on \nthe soft tissue proiling.\nAn emergence proile that mimics the natural tooth should \nbe obtained by successful intraoral soft tissue modiications. \nPrefabricated provisional crowns cannot mimic the complex-\nity and the variations of the soft tissue that occurs during the \nhealing process. Usually, a chairside modiication of the \nprovisional restoration can accomplish the optimal result. \nMoreover, it is advantageous if the provisional restoration \nscrew is retained to prevent irritating side effects of provi-\nsional cement on the peri-implant soft tissues, especially in \nsituations where frequent removals of the provisional restora-\ntion are required. However, in some instances, the screw \naccess hole will be facially oriented which may compromise \nthe esthetics.\nIn highly demanding areas, specially where the esthetic \noutcome is a priority, the soft tissue should be modiied to \nobtain an optimal emergence proile and gingival contours \nwith physiologic appearance as realistic as possible. The pre-\nviously described method allows for most accurate duplica-\ntion of the conditioned soft tissue when the inal impression \nis taken; thus their reproduction on the deinitive restoration \nis possible.\nPARAFUNCTION: NO OCCLUSAL GUARD\nEtiology\nWhen an implant reconstruction is considered in a bruxing \npatient, a patient with signiicant occlusal force, or an \nirregular plane of occlusion, occlusal analysis is warranted. \nhas to meet both aesthetic and functional parameters. In \naddition to the correct placement of the implant ixture, it is \nessential to achieve a soft tissue morphology as physiologi-\ncally realistic as possible.\nPrevention\nIdeal Implant Placement. The most important factor in \nobtaining an ideal emergence proile is the correct and ideal \nplacement of the implant. Implants should be placed approx-\nimately 2.0 mm from a natural tooth, 3.0 mm between \nimplants, and in the ideal buccal and lingual orientation with \nrespect to the incisal edge and occlusal table.\nImplant Size. An implant with too small of a diameter will \nlead to a nonideal emergence proile. The larger the implant \ndiameter, the more closely the emergence proile resembles \nthe natural tooth, especially in the posterior region of the \njaws. Most natural roots are greater than 4 mm in cross \nsection. The closer the implant diameter to the root diameter \n(2 mm below the cementoenamel junction [CEJ], where the \nideal crestal bone level resides), the more similar the crown \nemergence proile to a natural tooth. This is especially noted \nin the maxillary irst molar region because the root diameter \napproaches 8 mm, or twice the size of a 4-mm implant. The \nwider crown contour also decreases the interproximal space \nof the crown and decreases the incidence of food impaction \nduring function. The wide-diameter implant may also \nimprove sulcular daily oral hygiene by improving the crown \nemergence, avoiding the need for a prosthetic ridge lap of the \ncrown. The improved contour also allows access to the sulcus \nfor periodontal probing depths (Fig. 16.109).\nAbutments. Most healing abutments and stock abutments \nhave a cylindrical shape that does not reproduce correctly the \nFIG 16.109 The diameter of a tooth is often larger than an \nimplant to replace it. As such, the larger the implant, the more \nthe emergence proile at the cervical region resembles a \ntooth. (From Misch CE: Dental implant prosthetics, ed 2, \nSt Louis, 2015, Mosby.)"

The \nnight guard is still indicated to relieve stresses during noctur-\nnal parafunction, but the prosthetic reconstruction treatment \nplan should account for the greater forces (Fig. 16.111).\nNOT UTILIZING PROGRESSIVE  \nBONE LOADING\nPoor bone density may compromise implant success even \nwhen key implant position and number are satisfactory. In \naddition, crestal bone loss may be reduced with progressive \nloading.\nEtiology\nAs a general rule, the higher the risk factors, the more pro-\ngressive the recommended loading. The principles of gradual \nloading are demonstrated best in a cement-retained prosthe-\nsis. A longer healing time between stage I and stage II is sug-\ngested when forces are greater or bone is softer. This time \nallows greater mineralization of bone and a more mature \nlamellar bone interface to form next to the implants before \nthe load of the screws is applied to the implant bodies.\nPrevention\nThe concept of progressive loading is to allow the bone to \nadapt to increasing amounts of biomechanical stress. Rather \nthan immediately loading the bone-implant interface, \nmethods to slowly increase the stress over time are a beneit. \nThe progressive loading protocol uses a cement-retained \nprosthesis when implants are splinted together. Because a \nscrew-retained splinted restoration is not completely passive \nand a torque force applied to a screw is greater than a bite \nforce, a traditional screw-retained restoration cannot use pro-\ngressive loading to gradually load the bone.\nThe progressive loading protocol has six different methods \nto gradually load the bone or to increase the bone density \naround the implant (Box 16.6). These elements help give the \nimplant clinician the ability to evaluate the gradual loading \nprogress (Table 16.6).\nTime: Initial Healing. The histologic type of bone in contact \nwith the implant varies and can affect the amount of stress \nthe bone can sustain within physiologic limits. The ideal bone \nfor implant prosthetic support is lamellar bone. Lamellar \nbone is highly organized but takes about 1 year to mineralize \ncompletely after the trauma induced by implant placement.115 \nWoven bone is the fastest and irst type of bone to form \naround the implant interface; however, it is mineralized only \npartly and demonstrates an unorganized structure less able"

At 16 weeks, the surrounding \nbone is only 70% mineralized and still exhibits woven bone \nas a component. Computer-aided radiographic densitometry \nstudies have conirmed that the bone-implant interface \ndecreases the irst several months after surgical insertion of \nan implant.116 The percentage of bone mineralization and the \ntype of supporting bone inluence whether a load to the \nbone-implant interface is within its physiologic limits.\nIt has been reported that the bone-implant contact (BIC) \nis related to the bone density and the healing time. For \nexample, in a study by Carr et al the BIC was greater in the \nmandible than the maxilla (the mandible is usually more \ndense).117 In addition, the BIC was greater at 6 months com-\npared with 3 months in both jaws. An increase in BIC occurred \nin both the maxilla and mandible between 3 and 6 months \nand ranged from a 7% to 9%.90 The healing time before \nimplant loading may be related to the density of bone because \nthe strength of bone increases and the BIC increases with a \nlonger time period. Hence, 3 to 4 months of healing for D1 \nand D2 bone and 5 to 6 months for D3 and D4 bone have \nless risk than a shorter time period for all bone types. The \ntime period between surgical placement and full occlusal \nloading is variable, depending on the bone density.\nThe macroscopic coarse trabecular bone heals about 50% \nfaster than dense cortical bone. Although it heals more slowly, \nD1 bone has the greatest strength and greater lamellar bone \ncontact. The suggested healing time between the initial and \nsecond-stage surgeries is kept similar for D1 and D2 bone and \nis 3 to 4 months. A longer time is suggested for the initial \nhealing phase of D3 and D4 bone (5 and 6 months, respec-\ntively) because of the lesser bone contact and decreased \namount of cortical bone to allow for the maturation of the \ninterface and the development of some lamellar bone. In very \nimmature bone, the healing time may be as long as 8 months.\nThe D4 implant-bone interface typically found in poste-\nrior regions of the maxilla exhibits minimum initial bone \ncontact, with little to no cortical bone at the crest or apex. An \nimplant surgery initially may trigger an increase in the amount \nof bone in the region. The initial increase of bone cell activity \nmost likely results from the surgical trauma and the regional \nacceleratory phenomenon.74 A longer initial healing time is \nmost beneicial to the poorest bone density types.\nIn softer bone, a longer period of time of initial healing \nand gradual loading is suggested. As a general rule, D1 bone \nuses a 3-month (or more) period before loading, D2 bone a \n4-month (or more) period, D3 bone a 5-month (or more) \ninitial healing period, and D4 bone uses a 6-month (or more) \nperiod.\nThe combined observations of the macroscopic amount of \nbone in contact with a nonloaded implant and the microscopic \ntype of bone at the stage II surgery of the implant demonstrates \na wide difference in D1 to D4 bone densities. However, the \nmajor improvement in bone density and strength long term \noccurs as a consequence of loading the implant.\nFour prosthodontic steps are suggested for the reconstruc-\ntion of a partially or completely edentulous patient, with \nendosteal implants supporting a cemented prosthesis. Each \nof the four major prosthodontic appointments also are sepa-\nrated by a period of time related to the bone density observed \nat the initial time of surgery. In addition, the dentist attempts \nto gradually increase the load to the implant at each pros-\nthetic step.\nThe four prosthetic steps are: (1) abutment insertion, \npreparation, inal impression and temporary (of the esthetic \nzone); (2) a metal try-in and new bite registration; (3) initial \ndelivery of the prosthesis; and (4) inal evaluation of the \nrestoration and hygiene appointment.\nIn simple restorative cases, the prosthetic appointments \nmay be reduced to three appointments: (1) abutment selec-\ntion, preparation, inal impression, opposing impression, and \nclosed-mouth bite registration; (2) initial delivery of the res-\ntoration; and (3) inal evaluation stage (accompanied by a \nhygiene appointment).\nType D1 bone beneits from the greatest amount of lamel-\nlar bone contact at the beginning of the restoration process. \nAs a result, gradual loading of the implant interface through \nspacing of the prosthodontic appointments is least impor-\ntant, and the restorative appointments can be separated by as \nlittle as 1 week. Type D2 bone responds favorably to physio-\nlogic loads. The four prosthetic appointments during which \nthe implant body is loaded sequentially are separated by 2 \nweeks or more. As a result, the initial 4 months of healing \nafter surgery and 2 months for prosthesis fabrication make \nthe overall treatment time 5.5 months.\nThe prosthodontic appointments for D3 bone are sepa-\nrated by at least 3 weeks, and overall treatment takes about 7 \nmonths to complete, including the 5 months of initial healing. \nDuring this time the bone contact percentage can increase, \nand the ine woven bone trabeculae can mature into coarser \nlamellar trabeculae, with an increase in mineral content. The \nprogressive loading process is more critical for D3 bone than \nfor D2 or D1 bone because of its weakness and less initial \nbone contact.\nIn D4 bone the progressive bone loading protocol is most \ncritical. The scheduling of restorative appointments err on \nthe side of safety, separated by at least 4 weeks. As a conse-\nquence, the overall treatment time for D4 bone is twice that \nof D1 or D2 bone and requires at least 9 months (including \n6 months of initial healing). This schedule allows suficient \ntime for mature lamellar, mineralized bone to develop at the \ninterface and increases the numbers of trabeculae in direct \ncontact and within the network region of the implant (see \nTable 16.5).\nWhen the dentist uses multiple implants, the weakest bone \narea determines the gradual load protocol. If the anterior \nmaxilla and posterior maxilla are restored together, the pos-\nterior maxilla would determine the initial healing period and \nthe time period between each prosthetic appointment.\nDiet. The implant clinician controls the diet of the patient \nto prevent overloading during the early phases of the restor-\native process. During the initial healing phase, the clinician \ninstructs the patient to avoid chewing in the area, especially \nwhen the implants are placed in a one-stage approach with \nan exposed healing abutment. After being uncovered, the"

The \nirst transitional acrylic restoration in partially edentulous \npatients has no occlusal contact and no cantilevers. Its \npurpose is to splint the implants together and reduce stress \nby the mechanical advantage and to have implants sustain \nmasticatory forces solely from chewing. The second acrylic \ntransitional restoration has occlusal contacts placed over the \nimplants with occlusal tables similar to the inal restoration \nbut with no cantilevers in nonesthetic regions. The inal res-\ntoration has narrow occlusal tables and cantilevers designed \nwith occlusal contacts following implant-protective occlusion \nguidelines.\nProgressive Loading Phases. After the surgical stage II \nuncovery procedure or one-stage implant healing, the implant \nclinician evaluates clinical mobility, bone loss (horizontal and \nvertical), proper placement in reference to prosthetic design \nand angulation to load, zones of attached gingiva, and gingi-\nval thickness. The surgeon usually attaches a low-proile per-\nmucosal extension (PME) to the implant body at the end of \nthis appointment. This component extends through the \ntissue about 2 mm and is protected from early loading.\nIn selected cases, often when the implant surgeon and \nrestoring dentist are the same person, one may obtain the \npreliminary impression during this appointment if the soft \ntissues are outside the esthetic areas and if no bone recon-\ntouring or grafting has been performed or a one-stage surgi-\ncal approach was used during initial healing. The dentist \ninstructs the patient with a posterior implant in a partially \nedentulous arch not to wear any removable restoration. If \nanterior teeth are part of the removable prosthesis, a \n7-mm-diameter hole is placed completely through the partial \ndenture framework around each PME so it will not load the \nimplant. In completely edentulous patients, the tissue surface \nof the denture is relieved at least 5 mm over and around the \nimplants and is replaced by a tissue conditioner. The condi-\ntioner also is relieved a few millimeters. The patient returns \nin 2 weeks for suture removal and to replace the tissue con-\nditioner with a soft liner.\nThe procedures for a partially edentulous Kennedy class I \nor II patient are irst presented. The progressive bone-loading \nappointment sequence for cement-retained prostheses is as \nfollows (Table 16.7).\n1. Initial abutment selection, inal impression, and tran-\nsitional prosthesis I\n2. Metal superstructure try-in and transitional prosthesis II\n3. Initial insertion of inal prosthesis\n4. Final evaluation and hygiene\nPOSTOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS\nFOOD IMPACTION\nEtiology\nFood impaction after placement of a ixed implant restora-\ntion can be a signiicant complication that is troublesome to \nimplant connected to an abutment for cement retention is at \ngreater risk of loading during mastication. The patient is \nlimited to a soft diet such as pasta and ish from the inal \nimpression stage until the initial delivery of the inal prosthe-\nsis. The masticatory force for this type of food is about 10 psi. \nThis diet not only minimizes the masticatory force on the \nimplants but also decreases the risk of temporary restoration \nfracture or a partially uncemented restoration. Either of these \nconsequences can overload an implant and cause unwanted \ncomplications.\nThe diet should not be overlooked during the restorative \nphase of treatment. Most dentists have observed the fracture \nof an acrylic prosthesis with harder foods and greater occur-\nrence of uncemented restorations when they ignore the type \nof diet during the transitional prosthesis stages.\nAfter the initial delivery of the inal prosthesis, the patient \nmay include meat in the diet, which requires about 21 psi in \nbite force. The inal restoration can bear the greater force \nwithout risk of fracture or uncementation. After the inal \nevaluation appointment, the patient may include raw vegeta-\nbles, which require an average 27 psi of force. A normal diet \nis permitted only after evaluation of the inal prosthesis func-\ntion, occlusion, and proper cementation.\nIt should be noted that the most damaging forces to a \ntransitional (or inal) restoration is parafunction, not the \nfunction of eating. After the prosthesis is placed into occlu-\nsion, the evaluation of parafunction and methods to reduce \nits negative side effects are critical to the loading process.\nOcclusal Material. The occlusal material may be varied to \ngradually load the bone-implant interface. During the initial \nsteps, the implant has no occlusal contact and in essence has \nno material over it. At subsequent appointments, the clinician \nmay use acrylic as the occlusal material, with the beneit of a \nlower impact force than metal or porcelain. Either metal or \nporcelain can be used as the inal occlusal material.\nIf parafunction or cantilever length causes concern rela-\ntive to the amount of force on the early implant-bone inter-\nface, the dentist may extend the softer diet and acrylic \nrestoration phase several months. In this way, the bone has a \nlonger time to mineralize and organize to accommodate the \nhigher forces.\nOcclusion. The clinician gradually intensiies the occlusal \ncontacts during prosthesis fabrication. No occlusal contacts \nare permitted during initial healing (step 1). The irst transi-\ntional prosthesis is left out of occlusion in partially edentulous \npatients (step 2). The occlusal contacts then are similar to \nthose of the inal restoration for areas supported by implants. \nHowever, no occlusal contacts are made on cantilevers or \noffset loads (step 3). The occlusal contacts of the inal restora-\ntion follow the implant-protective occlusion concepts.\nProsthesis Design. There are four potential prosthesis \ndesigns in a restorative process. During initial healing, the \nclinician attempts to avoid any load on the implants, includ-\ning soft tissue loads. In a completely edentulous patient, relief"

There are many reasons for \nthe prosthesis to accumulate food.\nImproper Implant Placement. When implant placement is \nnonideal, a compromised prosthesis must be fabricated. This \nleads to improper contours that compromise esthetics and \nthe soft tissue health.\nInadequate Contact Area. If inadequate contact exists, food \naccumulation will result. This most often occurs when the \nrestoration is fabricated with angled or tilted adjacent teeth, \nwhich prevent a long contact area.\nPrevention\nImproper Implant Placement. Implant placement should \nbe ideal, if conditions (lack of bone) do not allow this, hard \nand soft tissue augmentation should be completed to provide \na more ideal condition for implant placement.\nInadequate Contact Area. When angled or tilted adjacent \nteeth are present, prior to the fabrication of the prosthesis, \nguide planes should be made to allow for a long contact area \nin the prosthesis. This also allows for the greater force distri-\nbution, which is advantageous, especially in high stress areas \n(Fig. 16.112).\nTreatment\nIf food impaction occurs on a chronic basis, the prosthesis \nshould be modiied or refabricated, especially if soft tissue \ncomplications arise.\nCEMENT RETENTION\nCemented implant prostheses have become popular because of \nthe lower cost, relative simplicity, more passive it, improved \nesthetics, and similarity to traditional prosthetics. However, \nwith all of these advantages comes a signiicant disadvantage, \nthe retention of postoperative cement. The retained cement has \nbeen shown to retain bacteria (similar to calculus with a natural \ntooth), which leads to peri-implant disease (Fig. 16.113).\nFIG 16.112 Food impaction.

(Adapted from LeBeau J: Maintaining the long-\nterm health of the dental implant and the implant-borne \nrestoration, Compend Contin Educ Oral Hyg 3[3]:3–10, 1997.)\nEtiology\nThe etiology of cement-retained peri-implantitis is the \nfollowing:\nCement. The retained cement acts as a nidus for bacterial \naccumulation and proliferation. The roughened surface of \nthe cement inhibits the hygienic removal of the bacteria, \nwhich leads to peri-implant disease. Cement acts the same \nway that as the etiologic factor in periodontal disease.\nTiming. Wilson has shown that the time it takes for retained \ncement to become problematic and to eventually be diag-\nnosed is in a range of 4 months to 9.3 years, with an average \nof 3 years.118\nSulcus Teeth vs. Implant. Around natural teeth the junc-\ntional epithelium and connective tissue attachment insert \nperpendicularly into the cementum, which tends to prevent \nthe low of excess cement into the sulcus. In contrast, the \nconnective tissue around dental implants runs parallel, with \nno attachment into the implant surface. The low of cement \nis not restricted, and it easily migrates apically (Fig. 16.114).\nSubmucosal Margins. Margins of implant restorations are \noften placed more than 2 mm subgingivally for a better emer-\ngence proile and esthetics. However, studies have shown the \ndeeper the margins, the more dificult the removal of cement. \nIn margins that are greater than 1.5 mm subgingivally, it is \nalmost impossible to remove the cement totally.119\nLocation.

Many clinicians believe that \ntwo-dimensional radiographs will depict retained cement. \nHowever, radiographs are unpredictable because only cement \nthat is present on the mesial or distal surfaces will be shown. \nAdditionally, many cements are not radiopaque and need an \nadequate thickness to be seen on a radiograph.120 Linkevicius \net al have shown in a clinical study that dental radiographs \nshould not be considered as a reliable method for cement \nexcess evaluation because results show that cement remnants \nare seen less than 10% of the time mesially and distally and \n0% of the time buccally and lingually (Fig. 16.116).121\nType of Cement.

Zinc phosphate is a well-known \npopular cement choice, which makes retrievability very dif-\nicult. Additionally, because of its solubility in the oral envi-\nronment, a dry ield is deinitely needed.\nProvisional cements are also popular in cementing implant \ncrowns as they allow for retrieval. However, because provi-\nsional cements exhibit weaker retentive strengths, uncemen-\ntation of the implant prosthesis may be problematic.\nRadiopacity of Cement. There is a large variation in the \nradiographic detection ability of cements. Some cements \nhave a very high radiographic density, which allows for detec-\ntion on radiographs. However, many cannot be detected, even \nat greater thickness (≈2 mm).\nCementation Technique. A common reason for retained \ncement is the cervical cementation technique, which usually \nparallels the technique for cementation on natural teeth. \nMost clinicians place an excessive amount of cement within \nthe internal surface of the crown, which leads to extrusion in \nthe sulcular area. Techniques using different amounts of \ncement have been evaluated with mixed results (Fig. 16.117).\nPrevention\nSupragingival Margins.

To reduce the amount of \nexcess cement, studies have shown that modiication of the \nabutment leads to less pressure and extruded cement. Ideally, \nthe abutment should be vented with two 0.75-mm radius \nvent holes placed 3 mm apical to the occlusal area of the \nabutment and 180 degrees apart. This technique by Wadh-\nwani has shown to limit the amount of cement extruded into \nthe gingival sulcus of implant-retained crowns (Fig. 16.119).124\nTechniques. Various techniques in the literature have been \ndiscussed to reduce retained cement. A popular technique is \nthe abutment copy technique, which utilizes Telon tape \ninside the intaglio surface prior to copying the abutment with \na polyvinyl siloxane (PVS) material. The cement-illed inal \nimplant crown is seated on the copied abutment for excess \ncement removal before it is quickly transferred intraorally to \nbe fully seated. This technique minimizes the possibility of \nretained cement; however, it has limitations when cementing \na multiple splinted implant prosthesis.125\nThe author has developed a technique (lubrication tech-\nnique), which utilizes water-soluble petroleum jelly placed \non the outer surfaces of the crown or prosthesis and below \nthe implant margin (i.e., sulcular area). This prevents any \ncement from adhering to the crown, sulcus, or underlying \nbone (Box 16.7 and Fig. 16.120).\nTreatment\nEven the most diligent and skilled implant clinician may leave \nresidual cement in the sulcular area of implant crowns. The \nimportance of postoperative appointments for implant \npatients following cementation of the restoration cannot be \noveremphasized. Regular maintenance is extremely crucial \nfor cement-retained crowns. Some of the symptoms that may \nwarrant an evaluation for retained cement are localized \ninlammation, bleeding on probing, exudate, progressively \nincreased probing depths, and radiographic bone loss.\nNonsurgical. Regular curettage with hand instruments.\nSurgical. In many cases, surgical access is necessary for \ncomplete cement removal, which includes lap, curettage, and \ndetoxiication with possible grafting (Fig. 16.121).\nSUMMARY\nAs outlined in this chapter, the principles utilized in dentistry \nfor natural teeth do not necessarily apply to the practice of \nimplant dentistry as it pertains to prosthetics. A dental \nimplant exhibits different attachment mechanisms to the host \nbone, which changes the force dynamics presented to their \nrespective prostheses. The intricate component mechanisms \nof a dental implant prosthesis react to forces placed upon \nthem, requiring greater care and attention when designing \nocclusal schemes. It is paramount that the implant surgeon \nand restoring dentist have a clear plan in place based on \nsound fundamentals to ensure that the placement of the nec-\nessary implants falls in line with proper biomechanical prin-\nciples. Steps may be taken to prevent unnecessary loads on \nthe implant prosthesis, from occlusal scheme and design to \nthe fabrication of bruxism guards for patients exhibiting \nparafunction.\nIn the prosthetic phase of treatment, possibly more than \nin any other phase, prevention may be the easiest to \nachieve. By using sound biomechanical principles, the \nimplant dentist may prevent many of the prosthetic and \nimplant complications that can occur over the life span of a \nrestoration.\nShould complications arise, such as screw loosening, por-\ncelain fracture, or retained cement, this chapter has provided \nprotocols to safely and predictably manage these events."

Misch\n17 \nThe clinical success and longevity of endosteal dental implants \nas load-bearing abutments are controlled largely by the \nmechanical setting in which they function. The treatment plan \nis ultimately responsible for the design of the prosthesis along \nwith the position and number of the implants. The most \ncommon complications of implant prostheses relate to biome-\nchanical factors such as porcelain fracture, unretained prosthe-\nses (cement or screw), abutment screw loosening, early implant \nfailure after loading, and implant component fracture.1-4\nStudies have shown that after an implant achieves rigid \nixation with proper crestal bone contour and gingival health, \nthe mechanical stress or strain beyond the physical limits of \nhard tissues is a primary cause of bone loss around loaded \nimplants.5-8 After successful surgical and prosthetic rehabilita-\ntion with a passive prosthesis, noxious stresses and loads \napplied to the implant and surrounding tissues result primar-\nily from nonideal occlusal contacts. Complications (prosthetic \nor bony support) reported in follow-up studies underline \nocclusion as a determining factor for success or failure.9,10 \nHowever, the choice of an occlusal scheme for implant-\nsupported prostheses is broad and often controversial. The \nocclusal scheme is especially important during parafunctional \nactivity of the jaws because the magnitude and duration of the \nparafunctional occlusal stresses are greater than functional \nstress. It is also more important when the implant foundation \nis not ideal in number or location to the implant-bone inter-\nface, where the overall surface area of load is reduced.\nAlmost all implant occlusal concepts are based on the \nconcepts developed with natural teeth and are transposed to \nimplant support systems with little to no modiication. This \napproach has some justiication. Wearers of complete den-\ntures are reported to exhibit mandibular movement and \nvelocity different from patients with natural dentitions. \nHowever, Jemt et al11 found that after ixed implant recon-\nstructions are placed into previously edentulous patients, the \ndisplacement of the jaw during mandibular opening and \nfunction is similar in velocity and movement to that in \npatients with natural teeth. Gartner et al12 also demonstrated \nsimilar habitual chewing for patients with implants and \npatients with natural teeth. During maximal occluding forces, \nelectromyograms demonstrated that the implant patient \ngroup activated similar working and nonworking muscles as \npatients with a natural dentition. It appears logical to derive \nimplant occlusion from occlusal principles for the natural \ndentition. However, several conditions indicate that implant \nprostheses are at greater biomechanical risk than natural \nteeth, which may lead to complications in both the prosthetic \ncomponents and the overall health of the implants that \nsupport them. As a result, some of the occlusal concepts for \nimplants should be modiied from concepts for the natural \ndentition. With a knowledge of the fundamentals of dental \nimplant occlusion, a clinician may signiicantly impact the \nlongevity of successful implant treatment for his or her \npatient, while avoiding many complications.\nDIFFERENCES BETWEEN NATURAL TEETH \nAND DENTAL IMPLANTS\nThe differences between natural teeth and dental implants are \nnumerous. Most importantly, a natural tooth has a support \nsystem that allows for a reduction of forces to the surround-\ning bone. A natural tooth is encompassed and suspended by \na periodontal ligament (PDL), and force and stress are dis-\nsipated and distributed away from the axis of natural teeth \n(Fig. 17.1). Because an implant has no PDL, the concentra-\ntion of force and stress is at the crestal region (Table 17.1).\nPERIPHERAL FEEDBACK SYSTEM\nThe control of the muscles of mastication is directly related \nto a peripheral feedback system that includes the enamel-\ndentin-pulp complex and mechanoreceptors in the dentate \ndentition. However, endosseous implants lack the periodon-\ntal proprioception feedback system, resulting in less ine \nmotor control and alteration of the awareness of force.\nTeeth\nNatural teeth have a unique sense of occlusal awareness in the \ncontrol of mastication, force, and control of muscles during \nswallowing. The role of the enamel-dentin-pulp complex has \nbeen shown in the control of oral function via the peripheral \nfeedback system.13 In combination with the periodontal \nmechanoreceptors (PMRs), afferent information is sent to the \nbrain on the horizontal and vertical forces applied to teeth. \nThe mechanoreceptors are very sensitive to low forces and \nallow for the recognition of occlusal force and the discrimina-\ntion of load magnitude and direction. The sensitivity of teeth \nvaries with anterior teeth being most sensitive to low forces \n(<1 N), whereas posterior teeth exhibit sensitivity to forces in \nthe range of less than 4 N."

The posterior teeth are strategi-\ncally located with large clinical crowns and multiple roots \n(increased surface area) to sustain the increased posterior \nforces. Additionally, the irst molars provide guidance during \nthe eruption process and are functionally positioned in the \ncenter of the occlusal table.14\nImplants\nWith dental implants, studies have shown that the lack of \nmechanoreceptors may inluence jaw motor control because \nof a peripheral feedback system.15 Because of the absence of \nthese mechanoreceptors, there is lack of afferent information \nThe number of mechanoreceptors have been shown to be \nmore numerous around anterior teeth compared with poste-\nrior teeth. The anterior receptors relay information concern-\ning forces in all directions because they have greater sensitivity \nto occlusal loading. These teeth contribute to the positioning \nof food in the oral cavity and manipulation of objects between \nthe teeth.14\nIn comparing individual teeth, the cuspid plays a domi-\nnant role in the control of function.

Additionally, \nthe morphologic makeup of the cuspid, featuring a lingual \ncontour that divides the mesial and distal via an axial \nridge, allows for crown strength for anterolateral guidance. \nBecause of the contour, arch location, and root length, this \nallows for the preferred mesial (not distal) canine guidance \nFIG 17.1 Schematic illustration of hard and soft tissue around a tooth and an implant.

When evaluating horizontal mobility on natural \nteeth, it is often dificult to determine the true movement. For \nexample, a “nonmobile” posterior natural tooth actually \nmoves horizontally 56–73 µm. The human eye does not per-\nceive this movement. The anterior teeth, which often have \nslight clinically observable movement, actually can move \napproximately 0.1 mm.\nWith nonvertical loading, forces on natural teeth are better \ntolerated and will adapt to the force much more favorably than \ndental implants. Studies have shown that lateral forces on a \nhealthy natural tooth are rapidly dissipated away from the bone \ncrest toward the apex of the tooth. This is because natural teeth \nmay move 56–108 µm with rotation around the apical one-\nthird of the root. Muhlemann23 found that horizontal tooth \nmovement may be divided into initial mobility and secondary \nmovement. The initial mobility is observed when a light force is \napplied, will occur immediately, and is a consequence of the \nPDL. Initial horizontal tooth mobility is greater than initial ver-\ntical movement. A very light force (500 g) horizontally moves \nthe tooth. The initial horizontal mobility of a healthy, “nonmo-\nbile” posterior tooth is less than that of an anterior tooth and \nranges from 56–75 µm, which is two to nine times the vertical \nmovement of the tooth. Initial horizontal mobility is even \ngreater in anterior teeth and ranges from 70–108 µm in health.24\nThe secondary tooth movement described by Muhlemann \noccurs after the initial movement when greater forces are \napplied. When an additional force is applied to the tooth, a \nsecondary movement is also observed, which is related \ndirectly to the amount of force. The secondary tooth move-\nment is related to the viscoelasticity of the bone and can \nmeasure 40 µm under considerably greater force (Fig. 17.5)."

Several hundred of these specialized receptors are \npresent, which are used for ine motor control and conscious \nperception of tactile forces when applied to the teeth.17\nThe compression of the collagen ibers in the PDL will \nsend nerve signals to the CNS. These receptors surrounding \nteeth have different sensitivities to the force applied, and each \nindividual receptor is stimulated independently depending \non the position within the PDL. The resultant force vectors \nhave varying numbers depending on the anatomic location \nwithin the oral cavity. Usually, the number of force vectors \ndecreases from anterior to posterior teeth. The anterior \nnatural teeth may perform very delicate tasks, whereas the \nposterior teeth are less sensitive. This is why the anterior teeth \ncan split food very precisely, whereas the posterior teeth are \nmainly used to grind food.28\nMasticatory Eficiency\nMany studies have evaluated the masticatory eficiency \nbetween teeth and implants. Svensson et al29 completed \nstudies on the mastication effectiveness of food between (1) \nnatural teeth, (2) natural teeth with full coverage restorations, \nand (3) implant-supported restorations. Results showed that \nnatural teeth were far superior in the reined action of split-\nting or incising food. Natural teeth were shown to be signii-\ncantly better able to position the food boluses between the \nteeth and be able to ine-tune the direction of the bite force. \nThis is most likely the result of the signal of the PMRs to the \nCNS on the spatial location and direction of forces needed to \nchew the food. However, with splinted ixed crowns and \nimplant prostheses, the results showed inconsistent and poor \nImplant. With dental implants, the nonvertical stress will \nmost likely result in trauma to the supporting bone. An \nimplant will gradually move and may move 10–50 µm.19 An \nimplant will have greater forces around the crest of the bone \nbecause an implant does not pivot as much as a tooth does, \nand all the forces are generated at the crest, which usually will \nresult in bone loss.\nSekine et al25 evaluated the movement of endosteal \nimplants with rigid ixation and found a range of 12–66 µm \nof movement in the labiolingual direction. Komiyama26 \nreported 40–115 µm of implant movement in the mesiodistal \ndirection under a force of 2000 g (≈4.5 psi) and a labiolingual \nrange of 11–66 µm. The greater implant movement in the \nmesiodistal dimension corresponds to the lack of cortical \nbone between the implants in this direction compared with \nthe thicker lateral cortical plates present in the labiolingual \ndimension. Rangert et al27 suggested that part of this implant \nmovement may also be due to component lexure of the \nimplant abutment and screw. The mobility of implants varies \nin direct proportion to the load applied and the bone density, \nrelecting the elastic deformation of bone tissue.\nExcessive Contacts/Occlusal Overloading\nWhen premature contacts or excessive contacts occur on a \nnatural tooth, the tooth will often become mobile, become \nhyperemic, or fracture. The associated proprioception will \nallow the neuromuscular system and peripheral feedback \nsystem to control the occlusal forces during function. This \nwill minimize the possibilities of prematurities and interfer-\nences. In comparison, when a premature contact is associated \nwith a dental implant, the patient usually is asymptomatic, \nand the implant will have no mobility. Because of the lack of \nPMRs, there is no feedback system present. This will most \nlikely result in crestal bone loss or mechanical failure will \nresult because there is no feedback system to make the patient \naware of a prematurity.\nClinical Signiicance.

The processing of PMRs \nrequires time for the central processing, resulting in a longer \ncontact phase of mastication.

An ideal \nocclusal scheme is a primary requisite for long-term implant \nprosthetic survival, especially when parafunction or a mar-\nginal foundation is present. A poor occlusal scheme increases \nthe magnitude of loads and intensiies mechanical stresses \n(and strain) to the implant system. These factors increase the \nfrequency of complications of the prosthesis and bone \nsupport. Crestal bone loss most likely leads to an increase in \nperi-implantitis. The conditions may also cause tissue \nshrinkage and loss of interdental papillae and poor esthetic \nresults. All these complications may be initiated by biome-\nchanical stress as a result of excessive occlusal loads (func-\ntional or parafunctional).\neficiency and protection of the dentition. Impairment \n(tooth-supported FPD) or absence (implant-supported pros-\nthesis) results in poorer performance and altered motor \nactivity. Patients with tooth-supported and implant-\nsupported prostheses also have a compromised protective \nmechanism in which they masticate their food with higher \nforce, less delay (i.e., may not be able to comprehend that the \nfood is too hard), and less precision. With increased speed of \nmastication, the greater possibility of damage to the pros-\nthetic system exists.\nBiting Force\nPMRs present in natural teeth provide proprioception and \nearly detection of occlusal forces and interferences. Bite forces \non natural teeth during mastication and parafunction are not \nas strong because of the ine motor control of the mandible. \nTrulsson and Johansson16 showed that the lack of propriocep-\ntion leads to a heavier bite in patients with implants com-\npared with natural dentition. Mericske-Stern et al32 measured \nthe oral tactile sensibility with test steel foil and showed that \nminimal pressure was signiicantly higher with implants than \nwith natural teeth (3.2 vs. 2.6 steel foil sheets). Jacobs and van \nSteenberghe33 evaluated occlusal awareness and found that \ninterference perceptions of natural teeth, implants with \nopposing teeth, and implants opposing implants were \napproximately 20 µm, 48 µm, and 64 µm. Hämmerle et al34 \nalso concluded the mean threshold value of tactile perception \nfor implants (100.6 g) was ninefold higher than that of \nnatural teeth (11.5 g).\nClinical Signiicance.

The value of \ndiagnostic casts or study models is crucial in all phases of \ndentistry, especially in oral implantology. When edentulous \nsites exist, the combination of continued bone loss and denti-\ntion changes related to missing teeth greatly increases the \nnumber of factors that must be considered for oral rehabilita-\ntion compared with traditional prosthodontic treatment. The \nimplant dentist must determine the type of implant prosthe-\nsis initially (i.e., FP-1, FP-2, FP-3, RP-4, RP-5), followed by \nthe number and location of ideal and optional abutment sites \nand the inal occlusal scheme.\nDiagnostic casts must be accurate reproductions of the \nmaxillary and mandibular arches with complete representa-\ntion of the edentulous areas (Fig. 17.10). Diagnostic casts \nmounted on an articulator allow for an initial evaluation for \nimplant site selection, angulation requirements, prosthesis \nselection, existing occlusion, and fabrication of a surgical \ntemplate. In addition, these study casts allow for a preopera-\ntive assessment of treatment options that may be discussed \nwith other practitioners and laboratory technicians and \nduring patient consultations.\nTo accurately assess the maxillomandibular relationship of \nthe implant patient, proper mounting of the study casts must \nbe completed using an articulator. An articulator is deined \nas a “mechanical instrument that represents the temporo-\nmandibular joints (TMJs) and jaws, to which maxillary and \nmandibular casts may be attached to simulate some or all \nmandibular movements.”35 Today, the use and indications for \nthe various types of articulators employed in prosthetic den-\ntistry are very controversial. At the present time, wide arrays \nof articulator types are available, with multiple ranges of \nmovements and adjustments, making classiication and \nnomenclature very confusing. In the dental literature, many \ndifferent classiications exist; however, today the most \nsimplistic and most often used classiication parallels the \n“Glossary of Prosthodontic Terms.” Articulators maybe cat-\negorized into four groups according to the adjustability of the \narticulators. This classiication is based on the ability of the \nThe concept of implant-protected occlusion (IPO) was \ndeveloped by Misch. It is unique and speciically designed for \nthe prosthetic rehabilitation of dental implants. This protocol \nprovides for an environment to reduce the biomechanical \nstress to the implant and prosthesis. Minor modiications \nfrom conventional prosthodontic occlusal concepts have \nbeen established with the sole purpose of reducing stress on \nthe prosthesis.\nThe ideal occlusion for an implant prosthesis is to control \nthe stress on the implant system, provide a prosthetic and \nbiologically acceptable implant interface, and maintain long-\nterm stability of the marginal bone and prosthesis. The occlu-\nsal scheme should maintain the occlusal load that has been \ntransferred to the implant system within the physiologic and \nbiomechanical limits of each patient. However, these princi-\nples are not identical for all patients or restorations. The \nforces generated by a patient are inluenced by ranges of \nparafunction, masticatory dynamics, implant arch position \nand location, arch form, crown height, and crown morphol-\nogy. The treatment planning philosophy for dental implants \nvaries greatly and depends on these several parameters. The \nimplant dentist can address these force factors best by select-\ning the most ideal implant position, number, and size; using \nthe progressive bone loading concept in poorer bone densi-\nties; and selecting the appropriate occlusal scheme using \nstress-relieving design elements.\nThe following guidelines and principles have been estab-\nlished to restore ixed and removable implant-supported pros-\ntheses. The IPO principles for ixed and removable prostheses \naddress several conditions to decrease stress to the implant \nsystem, including existing occlusion, implant body angle to \nocclusal load, cusp angle of implant crowns, mutually pro-\ntected articulation, cantilever or offset loads, crown height, \ncrown contour, occlusal contact position, timing of occlusal \ncontacts, and protection of the weakest component (Box 17.1).\nPREIMPLANT OCCLUSAL PRINCIPLES\nEvaluate Existing Occlusion Before  \nDental Treatment\nThe irst step in the process of treatment planning for dental \nimplants is the fabrication of accurate diagnostic casts for the \nFIG 17.10 It is paramount that diagnostic casts be an accu-\nrate representation of the entire dental anatomy including the \nedentulous ridges.

However, in a partially edentulous \npatient, the existing occlusion should be evaluated to deter-\nmine if noxious conditions are present.\nA considerable prosthetic advantage is present when centric \nrelation occlusion is harmonious with maximal intercuspal \nposition. Lack of change in the occlusal vertical dimension \npermits a closed-mouth centric recording during prosthetic \nreconstruction for the fabrication of the prosthesis without the \nneed for an accurate hinge axis recording of the condyles or \nfully adjustable articulators. When the incisal edge position of \nthe maxilla is determined, its position usually causes a steeper \nprotrusive or excursive position than the condylar disc assem-\nbly on semiadjustable articulators. As a result, posterior disoc-\nclusion can be easily established. These conditions permit the \nprosthetic reconstruction to be fabricated in the laboratory and \ntransferred accurately to the patient.\nCorrection of the delective contacts before treatment has \nmany advantages and may follow a variety of approaches \ndepending on the severity of the incorrect tooth position: \nselective odontoplasty (a subtractive technique), restoration \nwith a crown (with or without endodontic therapy), or \nextraction of the offending tooth. Premature contacts may be \nascertained after proper mounting of the study casts with the \nuse of a wax spacer or bite registration (open-mouth bite). \nOn removal of the occlusal records that separate the teeth, \nthe premature or irregular contacts may be determined \nand veriied when the casts are closed and then modiied \nintraorally.40\nThe occlusion may require complete rehabilitation to \neliminate potential unfavorable forces to the implant restora-\ntion. In some complex cases, both arches may require prosth-\nodontic treatment to establish the desired occlusal schemes. \nParafunctional bruxism with loss of incisal guidance from \ncontacts as the mandible closes in centric relation and \nthe evaluation of their potential noxious effects on the exist-\ning dentition and the planned restoration is important to \nevaluate.\nIn implant dentistry today, many clinicians begin to evalu-\nate the occlusion of the patient when the inal implant \nprosthesis is delivered to the patient. However, this time-\nframe is often too late for proper restoration of the patient \n(Fig. 17.15). The underlying question that helps determine \nthe need for occlusal correction before restoration of the \nimplant patient is the observation of negative symptoms \nrelated to the existing condition. This may include TMJ con-\nditions, tooth sensitivity, mobility, wear, tooth fractures, cer-\nvical abfraction, or porcelain fracture. The fewer and less \nsigniicant the indings, the less likely an overall occlusal \nmodiication is required before restoration of the patient. \nHowever, in most cases, to properly assess these conditions, \nthe clinician should perform these diagnostic techniques to \nminimize future complications.\nClinical signiicance. As a general rule, the more teeth \nreplaced or restored, the more likely the patient is restored to \nCO. For example, if a completely edentulous mandible is to \nbe restored with an implant-supported ixed prosthesis, CO \nprovides consistency and reproducibility between the articu-\nlator and the intraoral condition. The slight changes in occlu-\nsal vertical dimension and its relationship to the position of \nanterior implant abutments to the direction of force may be \nstudied and implemented on the articulator without the need \nto record a new occlusal vertical position on the patient. \nWhen one anterior tooth is being replaced, the existing MI \nposition is often satisfactory to restore the patient even \nthough a posterior interference and anterior slide into full \ninterdigitation may be present (with little clinical variance \nFIG 17.15 (A) A maxillary irst molar is replaced with an implant.

For \nexample, when an implant body is loaded along its long axis, \na 100-N force results with an axial force component of 100 N, \nand no lateral force component is observed. The implant \nbody should be positioned perpendicular to the curves of \nWilson and Spee, just as with natural teeth.\nattrition and an opposing single denture are the most \ncommon conditions that mandate more comprehensive \nopposing dentition modiication (Box 17.5).\nIdeal Treatment Planning—Implant Positioning\nThe positioning of the implant within the bone is vitally \nimportant to minimize stress to the implant system. When a \nforce is placed on a tooth or a dental implant, it is referred to \nas a vector (i.e., deined in magnitude and direction).41 Occlu-\nsal forces are typically three-dimensional, with components \ndirected along one or more of the clinical coordinate axes. \nThe primary forces of occlusion can be resolved into a com-\nbination of components in any given plane. The same mag-\nnitude of force can have dramatically different effects on the \nimplant system, solely because of the direction of the applied \nload. This is especially noted on implant support systems \nbecause they are more rigid.\nNatural teeth are designed primarily to be able to with-\nstand long-axis loads. The natural tooth roots in most of the \noral cavity are positioned perpendicular to the curves of \nWilson and Spee. Although chewing is in an elliptical “tear-\ndrop” pattern, when the teeth inally contact, the forces are \ndirected along the long axis of the roots, especially during \npower biting (Fig. 17.16). The apical movement of teeth is \nminimal compared with their lateral movement. Lateral loads \nare signiicant in the maxillary anterior teeth. The conse-\nquences of a lateral force to a tooth are reduced because of \nthe increased tooth mobility, which decreases the effects of \nthe lateral force component of a load.

A fundamental biomechanical formula is stress \nequals force divided by the area over which the force is applied \n(S = F/A).41 During either maximum intercuspation or CO, \nno occlusal contacts should be premature, most importantly \non implant-supported crowns or prosthesis. Premature \nocclusal contacts often result in localized lateral loading of \nthe opposing contacting crowns.\nHowever, most anatomic variations of the bone (e.g., bony \nconcavities) are located on the facial aspect and inluence \nimplant body positioning. An implant body may need to be \npositioned with a 15-degree angle to avoid the facial concav-\nity and is positioned at 15 degrees to the occlusal load. This \nangled implant may be restored during prosthetic recon-\nstruction with a 15-degree angle abutment. From the level of \nthe crest of the ridge to the occlusal plane, the implant abut-\nment looks similar to one in an axial implant body. The \nlaboratory technician and restoring clinician often treat the \nangled implant and axial implant in similar fashion. However, \nin the 15-degree angled implant body, the load to the \nfacial bone increases by 25.9% compared with an axial load \n(Fig. 17.18).45 Additionally, if the implant clinician places the \nimplant body with a 30-degree angulation, the buccal force \ncomponent of any occlusal load will result in a 50% increase \nof the load applied to the facial bone.\nPrevention. The clinician should always adhere to the ideal \nimplant positioning principles as discussed in Chapter 6 to \nprevent poor force distribution. Ideally, dental implants \nshould be placed perpendicular to the curve of Spee and the \ncurve of Wilson. This will minimize the possibility of angled \nforces, which may lead to force-related bone loss and \nFIG 17.18 An implant loaded in the long axis does not increase the buccal force component of \nthe load (far left). A 15-degree angle increases the buccal force component by 25.9% (middle). \nA 30-degree angle load increases the force by 50%. When the forces are applied along the long \naxis of an implant body, stresses are concentrated on the crestal region (far left). The intensity \nof the stress is not increased as a result of the position of the implant. The implant body in the \ncenter is 15 degrees off the long axis. With an angled abutment of 15 degrees, the implant \nrestoration is similar to the previous situation. However, now 25.9% greater stress is on the \ncrestal bone; all other factors are similar.

As a consequence of decreased quantity and \nquality of occlusal awareness, a premature occlusal contact \nmay remain on an implant crown after occlusal adjustment.\nThe procedure to obtain ideal contact is as follows \n(Fig. 17.23):\n1. Patient bites into centric relation with a very light force. \nAn extra thin articulating paper (<10 µm shimstock) is \nused, and any contact on the implant is removed. The \npatient should be able to bite lightly and the shimstock \nremoved unobstructed. GOAL: Natural tooth to take the \ngreater force so this will coincide with the PDL being \ncompressed.\n2. The patient is then instructed to bite with heavy force; the \nshimstock should be placed between the implant prosthe-\nsis and opposing dentition with dificulty in removal. \nGOAL: The heavy force exerted equals the compression of \nthe PDL, resulting in an even contact between the natural \ntooth and implant.\n3.

Even though the patient “feels” the \nocclusion to be ideal, premature contacts may still occur \nbecause of the difference in the vertical movement of teeth \nand implants in the same arch. Ideally, the natural teeth \nshould exhibit greater initial contacts compared with implants \nthrough “timed” contacts. When hard or parafunctional bite \nforces cause depression of the natural teeth, they are closer to \nthe implant, possibly overloading the implant. In cases where \nimplant restorations oppose each other, the implant prosthe-\nses must account for the vertical movement of the teeth.

The elimination or reduction of all shear loads to \nthe implant system is mandatory because of the inherent \nweakness of bone, porcelain, titanium components, and \ncement to shear loads. Occlusal loads applied at an angle to \nthe implant body may be separated into normal (compressive \nand tensile) and shear forces. As the angle of load to an \nimplant body increases, the amount of compressive and \ntensile forces is modiied by the cosine of the angle. The force \nis slightly reduced. However, the angled component of force \nis a shear force, and the shear force is the amount of force \ntimes the sine of the load, which considerably increases the \nload.

Not only does the magnitude \nof stress increase under angled loads, but it also evolves into \na more noxious shear component, which is more conducive \nto bone loss and screw loosening.56 The greater the angle of \nthe force, the greater the shear component. Bone is 65% \nweaker to shear load. The amount of the force increases, and \nthe strength of the bone decreases. It has been reported that \nangled occlusal forces decrease the ability of successful bone \nrepair on natural teeth. It may also impair successful bone \nremodeling around an implant.57\nNot only is the bone weakest to shear loads, but also forces \napplied at an angle to the bone further affect the physiologic \nlimit of compressive and tensile strengths of bone. A force \napplied at a 30-degree angle may decrease the bone tension \n(Table 17.3). A 60-degree force reduces the strength 30% \nunder compression and 55% under tension. Not only does \nthe crestal bone load increase around the implant with angled \nforces, but also the amount of stress the bone may withstand \n(i.e., the ultimate strength) decreases in shear, tension, and \ncompression. The greater the angle of load, the lower the \nultimate strength of bone. Therefore, IPO attempts to elimi-\nnate lateral or angled loads to an implant-supported prosthe-\nsis because the magnitude of the force increases and the \nstrength of the bone decreases. Barbier and Schepers58 histo-\nlogically evaluated implants loaded in the long axis vs. off-\naxis loading in dogs. The long-axis–loaded implants had \nlamellar bone at the interface. Lamellar bone is mineralized \nand organized and is called load-bearing bone in orthopedics. \nThe off-axis–loaded implants had woven bone at the inter-\nface, which is a weak, embryonic type of bone. It is less \nmineralized, unorganized, and weaker than lamellar bone \n(Fig. 17.28). The greater strains in the bone with off-axis \nloading may cause the bone to repair and places it at a higher \nrisk of overload and resorption.\nThe microstrain of the crestal bone is increased with an \nangled load and may shift from an axial load within physio-\nlogic limits to an angled load in the pathologic overload zone \nand, as a consequence, result in bone loss. The greater force, \nespecially in shear, is generated to the entire implant system. \nIn inite element analysis, when the direction of the force \nchanges to a more angled or horizontal load, the magnitude \nof the stress is increased by three times or more.54,55 In addi-\ntion, rather than a primarily compressive type of force, tensile \nand shear components are increased more than ten-fold com-\npared with the axial force. Studies have shown that in a pho-\ntoelastic block with implants inserted, the strain contours in \nthe bone may be observed (Fig. 17.27). The axial-loaded \nimplants have less strain in the system (left side and lower \nright of Fig. 17.27). The angled implant has more strain lines \nindicating greater loads (right upper implant).\nAn angled load to the implant long axis increases the com-\npressive forces at the crest of the ridge on the opposite side \nof the implant, increasing the tension component of force \nalong the same side as the load. The greater the angle of force \nto the long axis of the implant body, the greater the poten-\ntially damaging load at the crest of the bone. For example, \nthree-dimensional inite element analysis demonstrates that \na vertical load on an implant with 100% bone contact may \nhave compressive stress of 4000 psi (27.6 MPa) and almost \nno tensile stress at the bone-implant crest interface.54 With a \nload at a 45-degree angle on the same implant design, the \ncompressive stress may increase to 14,000 psi (96.6 MPa), \nand on the opposite side, tensile stress may increase to \n4000 psi (27.6 MPa). The compressive stresses are tripled, \nand the tensile stress increases 1000-fold with a load from a \n45-degree angle.\nFIG 17.27 A photoelastic study of opposing implants in a \nmaxilla and a mandible.

Ideally, there should be no clinical \nnonaxial loading of the implant system. If this cannot be \nachieved, modiications need to be made such as increased \nimplant number, larger implant diameter (i.e., increased \nsurface area), splinted implants, and a narrow occlusal table. \nIn some cases, the prosthesis may be modiied from a ixed \nto a removable prosthesis to incorporate increased soft tissue \nsupport to share the distribution of forces.\nManagement: Angled Loads. Most implant bodies inserted \nat an angle of greater than 12 degrees to the occlusal plane \nrequire an angled abutment. The implant clinician should \nunderstand that angled abutments are fabricated in two \npieces and are weaker in design than a two-piece straight \nabutment without an angle. Because less metal surrounds the \nabutment screw on one side of an angled abutment, it is at \nmore risk of fracture or is less able to be reduced in width for \nideal crown contours. Furthermore, a larger transverse load \ncomponent develops at the abutment screw and crest of the \nridge as a result of angled loads and increases the risk of \nabutment screw loosening. In a study by Ha et al,61 the angled \nabutment was compared with a straight abutment for screw \nloosening in the anterior maxilla. The angled abutments \nshowed more screw loosening with cyclic loading than the \nstraight abutments.\nSurgical Management. When lateral or angled loads cannot \nbe eliminated, a reduction in the force magnitude or addi-\ntional surface area of implant support is indicated to reduce \nthe risk of biomechanical complications to the implant \nsystem. For example, if three adjacent implants are inserted \nwith the irst implant in the long axis to the load, the second \nat 15 degrees, and the third at 30 degrees, the implant clini-\ncian may decrease the overall risk by (1) adding an additional \nimplant in the edentulous space next to the most angled \nimplant, (2) increasing the diameter of the angled implants, \nor (3) selecting an implant design with greater surface area. \nOf the three options, increasing the implant number is most \neffective to reduce overall stress to the system.

In the anterior maxilla, even under ideal \nconditions, the implant should be angled away from the labial \nbone, which results in the abutment being angled toward the \nfacial crown contour. An angled prosthetic abutment is \nrequired, and these implant bodies are more frequently \nloaded at an angle. Maxillary anterior teeth are usually loaded \nat a 12- to 15-degree angle to the occlusal plane (Fig. 17.32).\nThe natural dentition reduces the increased stress to the \nmaxilla by increasing the size of the roots compared with \nmandibular incisors and increasing the mobility of the teeth. \nIn the maxilla, a larger diameter implant or a greater number \nof implants are indicated to minimize the crestal bone stress \non each abutment, especially in patients exhibiting severe \nbruxism. Ridge augmentation may be necessary before \nimplant placement to improve implant position or facilitate \nthe use of a wider diameter implant. IPO aims at reducing \nthe force of occlusal contacts, increasing the implant number, \nor increasing the implant diameter for implants subjected to \nangled loads.\nShallow Anterior Guidance\nWith healthy natural anterior teeth, apical and lateral move-\nments are signiicantly larger compared with implant move-\nments, with a larger difference being seen for the lateral \nmovements. Because the differences in lateral movement are \ngreater, this allows for occlusal adjustment. As most ideal \nocclusal schemes with natural teeth suggest, the anterior \nteeth disocclude the posterior teeth during eccentric excur-\nsion. This is based on the concept of electromyographic \nstudies, which show that the stomatognathic system elicits \nsigniicantly less force when the posterior segments are not \nin contact in the lateral mandibular position.63 Other studies \nhave shown that for every 10-degree change in the angle of \ndisclusion, there is a 30% difference in load (Fig. 17.33).64\nIf healthy anterior teeth or natural canines are present, the \nmutually protected occlusion scheme allows those teeth to \ndistribute horizontal (lateral) loads during excursions, while \nthe posterior teeth disocclude during excursions (e.g., canine \nguidance or mutually protected articulation) (Fig. 17.34). \nThe posterior teeth are protected from lateral forces by the \nanterior guidance during excursions, and the anterior teeth \nhave lighter forces in excursions because the posterior teeth \ndo not contact.\nWhen lateral or angled forces are applied to the anterior \nteeth, the magnitude of the stress is increased. However, when \nmutually protected occlusal philosophies are applied, the \nconsequences of the lateral forces are reduced. The mutually \nprotected articulation concept is used in the implant-\nprotected concept. In protrusive mandibular movements, the \ncentral and lateral incisors disocclude the posterior teeth. In \nlateral excursions, the canine (and lateral incisor when pos-\nsible) disocclude the posterior teeth. In CO, the posterior and \ncanine teeth occlude. When the central and lateral incisors \nare natural, they may also occlude in CO (or MI). When the \nanterior teeth are implants, they may not occlude in centric \nocclusion, especially when the opposing dentition is also \nimplant supported."

The \nlateral posterior forces increase the moment loads to poste-\nrior implants. The posterior contacts during excursions also \nhave greater forces to the posterior implants because more \nmuscle mass contracts, and the occlusal contacts are closer to \nthe TMJ (class 3 lever). In addition, the posterior lateral loads \nincrease the force to the anterior teeth or implants during the \nexcursions. As a result, both the anterior and the posterior \nimplant components receive a greater force (Fig. 17.35).\nIn a study by Jemt et al,11 when implant-supported resto-\nrations were used in the maxilla opposing natural dentition, \nthe velocity of the mandible during excursions was greater \nwith group function than when incisal guidance was present. \nThe force to the implant system was greater with group func-\ntion.

According to Weinberg and Kruger,64 for \nevery 10-degree change on the angle of disclusion, there is a \n30% difference in load (Fig. 17.36). A 10-degree force on the \nanterior implants with a 68-psi load will increase to 100 psi \nwhen the incisal guidance is 20 degrees and will further \nincrease to 132 psi if the incisal guidance is 30 degrees. As a \nconsequence, the impression by these authors is that the \nincisal guidance should be less than 20 degrees.

The anesthetized \nnatural canine has been compared with the proprioception \nof an implant.67 Proprioception is transmitted through the \nbone from an implant but in a reduced amount compared \nwith a natural tooth. A mutually protected occlusion is still a \nbeneit when a single-tooth canine implant is restored. In \nother words, a greater decrease in lateral forces occurs when \na natural anterior tooth root is involved in the excursion \ncompared with an implant crown, but an implant crown also \ncan decrease the force and is better than a pontic in the canine \nposition. In addition, the class 3 lever mechanism of the \ncanine position still is able to reduce the force in excursions \nwhen the posterior teeth do not contact.\nNo occlusal contact occurs on the single-tooth canine \nimplant crown during mandibular excursions to the opposite \nside. During protrusion, no contact on the canine implant \ncrown is ideal. If a contact is necessary, it is adjusted so that \na light bite force has no occlusal contact on the implant \ncrown. Under a heavy bite force in protrusive movements, the \ncanine implant crown may contact.\nThe occlusion during the working excursion toward the \ncanine implant crown is of particular concern. The dentist \nshould make an attempt to include a natural tooth in the \nlateral excursion because teeth have greater proprioception \nthan implants. To create a mutually protected articulation \nscheme that includes a lateral incisor is preferable because \nthis tooth is farther from the TMJ. With a light working \nlateral excursion, the lateral incisor occludes irst and moves \n97 µm (when in health), and then the canine implant crown \nengages and helps disocclude the posterior teeth. During a \nheavy bite force excursion, the lateral incisor and implant \ncrown contact with similar magnitude (Fig. 17.40). However, \nin Angle Class II, division I patients, the irst premolar may \nneed to be included in the excursion process, rather than \nthe lateral incisor because the horizontal overjet may be \nexcessive.\nClinical signiicance. All lateral excursions in the concept \nof implant-protected occlusion opposing ixed prostheses or \nnatural teeth use anterior teeth or implants whenever possi-\nble to disocclude the posterior components. The resulting \nlateral forces are distributed to the anterior segments of the \njaws, with an overall decrease in force magnitude. This occlu-\nsal scheme should be followed whether or not anterior \nimplants are in the arch. However, if anterior implants must \ndisocclude posterior teeth, natural teeth (whenever possible) \nare irst used during the initial primary tooth movement. \nWhen multiple anterior teeth are missing, two or more \nimplants splinted together (when possible) should help dis-\nsipate the lateral forces. The anterior guidance of implant-\nsupported prostheses should be as shallow as possible to \nminimize forces on the anterior implants.\nDecreased Posterior Crown Cusp Angle\nThe angle of force to the implant body may be inluenced by \nthe cusp inclination of the implant crown in similar fashion \nas an angled load to an implant body. The posterior natural \nteeth often have steep cuspal inclines, and 30-degree cusp \nangles have been designed in denture teeth and natural tooth \nprosthetic crowns (Fig. 17.41). The greater cusp angles are \noften considered more esthetic and may even incise food \nmore easily and eficiently.68 To negate the negative effect of \nan angle cusp contact, the opposing teeth need to occlude at \nthe same time in two or more exact positions on the ipsilat-\neral cusp angles of the crowns, which is highly unlikely to be \nachieved in a clinical setting (Fig. 17.42).\nThe occlusal contact along only one of the angled cusps \nresults in an angled load to the implant system even when it \nis not premature to other occlusal contacts (Fig. 17.43).

The moment \nforces on marginal ridges also may contribute to forces that \nincrease abutment screw loosening. Marginal ridge contacts \non individual implant crowns or the most mesial or distal \nsplinted crown should be avoided whenever possible.\nSplinted Implants. The marginal ridge occlusal contact is \nnot a cantilevered load when located between two implants \nsplinted to each other. In addition, the metal/zirconia frame-\nwork that splints the implants supports the porcelain/ \nzirconia in the marginal ridge region and minimizes the risks \nof fracture. The splinted crowns decrease occlusal forces to \nthe crestal bone, reduce abutment screw loosening, decrease \nthe force to the cement interface, increase retention of the \ncrowns, and reduce the force to the bone-implant interface. \nAdjacent implant crowns should most often be splinted \ntogether, and the occlusal contact position may be extended \nfrom the most mesial to most distal implants (minus the \nmarginal ridges at each extreme) (Fig. 17.51).\nScrew-Retained Prosthesis. A posterior screw-retained \nrestoration often requires cantilevered occlusal contacts. The \nocclusal screw hole rarely is loaded because the illing mate-\nrial easily wears or fractures. As a result, the occlusal contacts \nof screw-retained crowns are not often directed over the top \nof the implant but are offset several millimeters away. This \nresults in a higher moment load to the implant system, yet \nthe occlusal access hole is the best position for the occlusal \ncontact.\nOccasionally, when a maxillary posterior tooth is in the \nesthetic zone, the implant may be 1–2 mm to the facial aspect \nof the midcrest (when bone is abundant) to be closer to the \nbuccal cusp to improve the esthetic emergence of maxillary \nimplant crowns. Under these conditions, the central fossa is \npositioned more facial, the lingual contour of the crown is \nreduced, and the occlusal contact is over the lingual aspect of \nthe implant body (which is under the central fossa).\nfossa of an implant crown should be 2–3 mm wide in poste-\nrior teeth and parallel to the occlusal plane. The ideal implant \nbody position for function is most often directly under the \ncentral fossa in the mandible and maxilla. The ideal primary \nocclusal contacts will reside within the diameter of the \nimplant within the central fossa. Secondary occlusal contacts \nshould remain within 1 mm of the periphery of the implant \nto decrease moment loads. Marginal ridge contacts usually \nshould be avoided unless implants are splinted together. \nWhen the implant is positioned closer to a stamp cusp (buccal \nin the mandible and lingual cusp in maxilla), the cusp angle \nis lat, and the contact is over the implant (Fig. 17.49).\nPosterior Implant Position. The most common implant \nbody position for a posterior implant is in the middle of the \nbuccolingual dimension of the bone. The implant surgeon \nbegins the osteotomy in the middle of the ridge, and the \nimplant diameter maintains 1.5 mm or more of bone on each \nside. The center of an edentulous ridge more often corre-\nsponds to the central fossa of a posterior crown in either \narch. Occasionally, it may correspond to the natural tooth \nlingual cusp region but less often is under the buccal cusp in \neither arch.\nThe marginal ridge contacts are also a cantilever load on \nthe single-tooth implant crown because the implant is not \nunder the marginal ridge but may be several millimeters away. \nIf the implant body is 5 mm in diameter and replaces a \n12-mm molar in the mesiodistal dimension, a marginal ridge \ncontact may create a magniied moment load equal to 3.5 mm \ntimes the amount of the force. A 100-N load will be multi-\nplied to a 350–N-mm force on the marginal ridge (Fig. 17.50).\nThe mesiodistal dimension of the molar crown often \nexceeds the buccolingual dimension, so the marginal ridge \ncontact may contribute more to the biomechanical risk. In \naddition, laboratories often create an all-porcelain marginal \nridge completely unsupported by the metal substructure, \nwhich places a shear load on the porcelain.

The anterior mandibular CHS is usually \nmeasured from the crest of the ridge to the mandibular incisal \nedge. However, the anterior maxillary CHS is measured from \nthe maxillary crestal bone to the maxillary incisal edge, not \nthe occlusal contact position. The ideal CHS required for a \nixed implant prosthesis should be between 8 and 12 mm. \nThis measurement accounts for the “biologic width,” abut-\nment height for cement retention or prosthesis screw ixation, \nocclusal material strength, esthetics, and hygiene consider-\nations around the abutment crowns (Fig. 17.57).\nRemovable prostheses often require a CHS greater than \n12 mm. The CHS is measured from the crest of the bone to \nthe plane of occlusion in the posterior region and the incisal \nedge of the arch in question in the anterior region. The \nimplant crown height is often greater than the original natural \nanatomic crown even in division A bone. If the implant is \nshorter the distance between the implants, the greater the \nmechanical advantage and the greater the force on the implant \nsystem (Fig. 17.55).\nThe goal for cantilevers is to reduce the force on the \npontics of the lever region compared with that over and \nbetween the implant abutments. To reduce the amount of \nforce that is magniied by the cantilever, the occlusal contact \nforce may be reduced on the cantilevered portion of the pros-\nthesis. A gradient of force type of load that gradually decreases \nthe occlusal contact force along the length of the cantilever is \nbeneicial. In addition, no lateral load is applied to the canti-\nlever portion of the prosthesis (whether it is in the posterior \nor anterior region). Although the functional forces of occlu-\nsion during mastication may not be signiicantly altered by \nthis technique, parafunctional forces (which are the most \ndamaging) are signiicantly reduced with a gradient of force \nocclusal adjustment.\nAvoid Excessive Crown Height Space\nThe interarch distance is deined as the vertical distance \nbetween the maxillary and mandibular dentate or dentate \narches under speciic conditions (e.g., the mandible is at rest \nor in occlusion).35 A dimension of only one arch does not \nhave a deined term in prosthetics; therefore, Misch proposed \nthe term “crown height space” (CHS).73 The CHS for implant \ndentistry is measured from the crest of the bone to the plane \nof occlusion in the posterior region and the incisal edge of \nthe arch in question in the anterior region (Fig. 17.56). In the \nFIG 17.53 A cantilever on two implants may be considered \na class I lever. When the implants are 10 mm apart, with a \n20-mm cantilever, a mechanical advantage of 2 is created. \nThe load on the cantilever will be multiplied by 2 on the far \nimplant, and the implant close to the cantilever receives the \ntotal stress of the two loads.

In this situation, 50% of the occlusal load is trans-\nformed into a horizontal or shear component to the implant \nsystem.

This permits a horizontal overjet to exist \nand push the tongue out of the way during occlusal contacts \n(just as natural teeth).

As a result of the ridge laps or porcelain \nextensions, home care in the sulcular region of the implant \nis impaired by the overcontoured crown design. The dental \nloss or probe may reach under the ridge lap to the free gin-\ngival margin, but it cannot enter the gingival sulcus. Daily \nhygiene is almost impossible to perform. The narrower pos-\nterior occlusal table facilitates daily sulcular home care. A \nnarrow occlusal table combined with a reduced buccal \ncontour (in the posterior mandible) facilitates daily care, \nimproves axial loading, and decreases the risk of porcelain \nfracture. However, in the esthetic zone, the ridge lap design \nmay be necessary to restore the implant rather than removing \nit, bone grafting, and replacing the implant. An increased \nfrequency of hygiene may be indicated.\nThe mandibular implant prostheses should be reduced \nfrom the buccal and the maxillary crown reduced from the \nlingual.

Byun77a showed that open contacts (no resis-\ntance) occur 38% of the time, and loose contacts (minimal \nresistance) occur 20% of the time over a mean time of 57 \nmonths. Koori et al78 showed interproximal gaps approxi-\nmately 43% of the time over a period of 1 to 123 months. Wei \net al79 reported an even higher incidence of 58% with the \naverage time period being 2.2 years. Wong et al80 showed \nFIG 17.75 When adjacent teeth are tilted or have migrated, \nit often results in a point contact. An enameloplasty should \nbe completed to allow for one path of insertion and a long \ncontact area. \nFIG 17.76 Food impaction resulting from inadequate contact \nareas and poor emergence proile. \nFIG 17.77 Placing guide planes on adjacent teeth allows for \na long proximal contact area, which will allow for better force \ndistribution. \nA common problem in the replacement of posterior teeth \nis lack of suficient interproximal contact or loss of contact \nover time. This is most commonly seen with single edentu-\nlous sites in which the adjacent teeth have rotated, tilted, or \nmigrated. This results in the fabrication of a prosthesis that \nhas many disadvantages (Fig. 17.75).\nDificulty in Seating Prosthesis. When the interproximal \nsurfaces are not parallel to each other, two paths of insertion \nare often required to seat the prosthesis properly (i.e., or may \nprevent complete seating of the restoration). When the two \nadjacent teeth have interproximal surfaces that parallel each \nother, only one path of insertion exists, making the seating \nmuch easier.\nPrevention. Before the inal impression, the adjacent \nproximal areas should be adjusted with guide planes so that \nthey are parallel. This is most often achieved with the use of \na diamond bur (i.e., lat-end cylinder). This will allow for a \nbroader contact area and one path of insertion for the inal \nplacement of the prosthesis. Before implant placement (i.e., \ntreatment planning phase), the patient should be informed \nof the modiications of the adjacent teeth. This communica-\ntion with the patient will prevent patient questions and \npossible dissatisfaction later in the prosthodontic process.\nFood Impaction. Point contacts are more prone to impact-\ning food and developing a “black triangle,” which can lead to \ndificulty in hygiene and esthetic compromises.\nPrevention. By increasing the proximal contact areas via \nguide planes on the adjacent teeth, there is a decreased pos-\nsibility of spaces for food impaction. The laboratory must be \ninstructed to fabricate an ideal emergence proile for the \nprosthesis (Fig. 17.76).\nLack of Force Distribution. With longer contact areas, a \nbetter force distribution (i.e., adjacent tooth will absorb \nmore of the force) is present, which decreases the offset loads \nassociated with the cantilevered mesial and distal marginal \nridge areas."

Several possible factors contribute to open \ncontacts.\nInadequate proximal contact. A small proximal contact \narea will most deinitely impact this complication. Open con-\ntacts usually do not occur between natural teeth because of \nphysiologic drift. When an implant is adjacent to a natural \ntooth, the osseous interface will not allow for the implant to \nmove in association with the natural tooth. When natural \nteeth move through natural physiologic movement, attrition, \nand parafunctional forces, with an implant having an osseous \ninterface, the teeth will not move.\nAcquired contact area opening. Usually, a contact area \nthat opens after some time (e.g., originally strong contact area \npresent) originates from occlusal forces, mainly from the \nmandibular closure muscles (i.e., lateral and medial ptery-\ngoid, masseter, temporalis). The forces directed to the teeth \nare mainly dictated by inclined cusp planes. Forces exist that \npush teeth mesial and distal; however, the anterior, forward \nvector is ive times stronger than the posterior force.80,81\nAdditionally, studies have shown the anterior component \nof force is transmitted via the interproximal contacts and that \nits strength will decrease with increased distance from the \nposterior teeth.82 Another possible reason for the loss of \ncontact area is craniofacial growth. Facial growth has been \nreported in some patients well beyond adulthood. Even \nminor facial growth may allow for mesial, buccal, or vertical \ngrowth leading to opening of occlusal contacts (Fig. 17.78).83\nManagement and Prevention\nEnameloplasty.

When the anterior teeth are \nimplants, they should not occlude in centric occlusion, \nespecially when the opposing dentition is also implant \nsupported.\nGroup function (or unilateral balance) has been suggested \nwith periodontal bone loss on the remaining teeth. The \nconcept was to share the lateral loads during excursions with \nmore teeth. For example, in this philosophy, a mandibular \nexcursion to the right contacts as many anterior and posterior \nteeth on the right as possible. This is not indicated in IPO. \nThe lateral posterior forces increase the moment loads to \nposterior implants. The posterior contacts during excursions \nalso have greater forces to the posterior implants because \nmore muscle mass contracts and the occlusal contacts \nare closer to the TMJ (class 3 lever). In addition, the posterior \nlateral loads increase the force to the anterior teeth or implants \nduring the excursions. As a result, both the anterior and \nthe posterior implant components receive a greater force \n(see Fig. 17.35).\nIn a study by Jemt et al,11 when implant-supported resto-\nrations were used in the maxilla opposing natural dentition, \nthe velocity of the mandible during excursions was greater \nwith group function than when incisal guidance was present. \nThe force to the implant system was greater with group func-\ntion. Kinsel and Lin91 reported that group function in patients \nwith implant-supported prostheses had a porcelain fracture \nrate of 16.1% and occurred in 51.9% of implant patients. \nWhen anterior disclusion was the occlusal scheme in excur-\nsions, the fracture rate on implant crowns was 5.3%, and this \ncomplication affected 15.9% of patients (more than a three-\nfold difference).\nAll lateral excursions in IPO opposing ixed resulting \nlateral forces are distributed to the anterior segments of the \njaws, with an overall decrease in force magnitude. This occlu-\nsal scheme should be followed whether or not anterior \nimplants are in the arch. However, if anterior implants must \ndisocclude posterior teeth, natural teeth (whenever possible) \nare irst used during the initial primary tooth movement. \nWhen multiple anterior teeth are missing, two or more \nimplants splinted together (when possible) should help dis-\nsipate the lateral forces. Prostheses or natural teeth use ante-\nrior teeth or implants whenever possible to disocclude the \nposterior components. The resulting lateral forces are distrib-\nuted to the anterior segments of the jaws, with an overall \ndecrease in force magnitude.\nUse Progressive Bone Loading for  \nPoor Bone Quality\nComplication. In poorer quality of bone, occlusal overload \nis a potentially damaging complication for an implant pros-\nthesis. When unfavorable force magnitude and direction is \ncoupled with poor bone quality, an increase in implant failure \nresults.92,93 The bone density is a critical factor in the deter-\nmination of the healing time and the type of prosthesis, and \nit is paramount that a separate surgical and prosthetic tech-\nnique be given for each bone density type.\nMutually Protected Articulation\nNumerous philosophies exist on the occlusal schemes for \nnatural teeth. One such scheme is termed “mutually pro-\ntected occlusion,” in which the anterior teeth disocclude the \nposterior teeth during excursions (i.e., incisal guidance \nsteeper than the condylar disc assembly).84-87 The posterior \nteeth protect the anterior teeth in CO, and the anterior teeth \nprotect the posterior teeth in mandibular excursions. This \nocclusal design is based on the concept of using the maxillary \ncanine as the key of this occlusion scheme to avoid lateral \nforces on the posterior teeth.88\nAnterior, compared with posterior, bite force measurements \nand electromyographic studies provide evidence that the sto-\nmatognathic system elicits signiicantly less force when the \nposterior segments are not in contact when the anterior teeth \nocclude.89 For example, the maximum bite force in the poste-\nrior regions of the mouth (with no anterior occlusal contact) \nis 200–250 psi. The maximum bite force in the anterior region \n(with no posterior occlusal contact) is 25–50 psi. This differ-\nence results from a biologic response and a mechanical condi-\ntion when the posterior teeth do not contact. Almost two-thirds \nof the temporalis and masseter muscles do not contract when \nposterior teeth do not occlude.90 In addition, the TMJ and teeth \ncomplex form a class 3 lever condition (i.e., the nutcracker).40 \nAs a result, the closer the object is placed toward the hinge \n(TMJ), the greater the force on the object. In addition, the \ngreater lateral mobility of the anterior teeth compared with the \nposterior teeth (108 µm vs. 56 µm) also decreases the conse-\nquences of the lateral forces during excursions.\nIn CO, the anterior teeth contacts are shared and protected \nby the occlusal contacts of the posterior teeth. When the \ncanine separates the posterior teeth in right or left lateral \nexcursions, the term “canine” or “cuspid protected occlusion” \nmay be used. If healthy anterior teeth or natural canines are \npresent, the mutually protected occlusion scheme allows \nthose teeth to distribute horizontal (lateral) loads during \nexcursions, while the posterior teeth disocclude during excur-\nsions (e.g., canine guidance or mutually protected articula-\ntion) (see Fig. 17.34). The posterior teeth are protected from \nlateral forces by the anterior guidance during excursions, and \nthe anterior teeth have lighter forces in excursions because \nthe posterior teeth do not contact. In other words, when \nlateral or angled forces are applied to the anterior teeth, the \nmagnitude of the stress is increased. However, when mutually \nprotected occlusal philosophies are applied, the consequences \nof the lateral forces are reduced.\nClinical Signiicance. The mutually protected articulation \nconcept is used in the implant protected occlusion technique \nwith the following designs:\n• In protrusive mandibular movements, the central and \nlateral incisors disocclude the posterior teeth.\n• In lateral excursions, the canine (and lateral incisor when \npossible) disocclude the posterior teeth.\n• In CO, the posterior and canine teeth occlude.

Overall, the density \nof trabecular bone evolves as a result of mechanical deforma-\ntion from microstrain. The deformation of the alveolar bone \nby mechanical forces is also related to the thickness of the \nbony plate.\nClinical evaluation conirms an increase in the amount of \ntrabecular bone and cortical plate thickness in patients with \nnatural teeth exhibiting parafunction. A dentist can observe \nthese bone density changes when attempting to extract teeth. \nIn a severely parafunctional patient, the tooth usually frac-\ntures when attempting to remove it because the surrounding \nbone is stronger than the tooth. In a maxillary posterior \nsecond molar unopposed by any mandibular tooth, the bone \nis so soft that the complete tuberosity and surrounding bone \nfractures and the tooth and attached surrounding bone are \nremoved as one piece. Frost98 proposed that bone mass is a \ndirect result of the mechanical usage of the skeleton. He rede-\nveloped a mechanical adaptation chart relating trivial loading, \nphysiologic loading, overloading, and pathologic loading \nzones to ranges of microstrain. His studies demonstrated \nincreases in cortical bone mass related to strains applied to \nthe bone (Fig. 17.80).\nBone cells and the extracellular matrix comprise the \nstrain-sensitive population, and each plays a vital role in the \nmediation of the interface. A review of the literature of in vivo \nand in vitro studies has shown that dynamic or cyclic loading \nis necessary to cause a signiicant metabolic change in the \nbone cell population.99 The greater the rate of change of \nPrevention and Treatment. Misch94 irst proposed the \nconcept of progressive bone loading, which allows for modi-\nied prosthetic techniques to increase the bone-implant inter-\nface. This is accomplished via principles associated with \nWolff’s law, where bone mass increases in response to con-\ntrolled stresses placed on the prosthesis. By gradually increas-\ning the load applied, implants in poor bone quality are \nallowed to establish increased bone mass and density. The \ndifferent elements of progressive bone loading include treat-\nment time intervals (approximately 3–8 months), modiied \ndiet (softer food), occlusion (gradually intensify the occlusal \ncontacts), and allowing loading to gradually increase during \nprosthesis construction and a gradual increase in the strength \nof prosthesis materials (from resin to metal to porcelain).\nRationale for Bone Density: Bone Physiology. Cortical \nand trabecular bone throughout the body are constantly \nmodiied by either modeling or remodeling.95 Modeling has \nindependent sites of formation and resorption and results in \nthe change of the shape or size of bone. Remodeling is a \nprocess of resorption and formation at the same site that \nreplaces previously existing bone and primarily affects the \ninternal turnover of bone, including the region where teeth \nare lost or the bone is next to an endosteal implant. These \nadaptive phenomena have been associated with the alteration \nof the mechanical stress and strain environment within the \nhost bone.96\nBone responds to hormonal and biomechanical regulation \nand in some instances in which the demand for calcium is \ngreat (the primary objective for hormonal regulation), func-\ntional loading can compete and maintain bone mass.97 The \nstress applied to bone is measured by the magnitude of force \ndivided by the functional area over which it is applied.

    "content": "760\nCHAPTER 17 Occlusion Complications\nThe concept of progressive loading is to allow the bone to \nadapt to increasing amounts of biomechanical stress. Rather \nthan immediately loading the bone-implant interface, \nmethods to slowly increase the stress over time are beneicial. \nThe progressive loading protocol uses a cement-retained \nprosthesis when implants are splinted together. Because a \nscrew-retained splinted restoration is not completely passive \nand a torque force applied to a screw is greater than a bite \nforce, a traditional screw-retained restoration cannot use pro-\ngressive loading to gradually load the bone.\nAs a general rule, the higher the risk factors, the more \nprogressive loading is recommended. The principles of \ngradual loading are demonstrated best in a cement-retained \nprosthesis and are least applicable for the screw-retained bar \nof a mandibular removable prosthesis type 5 (RP-5) restora-\ntion. In addition, gradually loading an RP-4 or RP-5 prosthe-\nsis with a screw-retained superstructure bar is dificult \napplied strain in bone, the more bone formation is increased.100 \nThe effect of applied strains on bone is dictated not only by \nthe rate of the applied load but also by the magnitude and \nduration.\nIn other words, the prosthetic loading of the dental implant \nchanges the number and density of bone cells. Cyclic loading \nis necessary to cause a signiicant metabolic change in bone \ncell population. Lower magnitude loads applied for many \ncycles can cause the same anabolic effects of larger loads \napplied for a limited number of cycles.101 A range of clinical \nconditions may equate to an increase in bone density, with \nprosthetic loading a logical condition for a dental implant.\nClinical Studies Supporting Progressive Loading. The bio-\nmechanical environment plays an intricate role in the quality \nand compositional outcome of the new implant-bone inter-\nface. Under loading, bone behaves as a structure with material \nand architectural properties and as a biologic system.102 Func-\ntional loading of the implant brings additional biomechanical \ninluences, which greatly affect its maturation.\nComputer-aided assessment of ixated implants through \ndigital subtraction radiographic image analysis and an interac-\ntive image-analysis system demonstrate an increase in density \nof peri-implant bone structures over a 6-month to a 4-year \nperiod after the implant was placed.103 The major changes of \nbone condensation around the implants occurred after the irst \n2 years they were loaded (Fig. 17.81). Bone density increase is \nprimarily relective of the local stress factors, and endosteal \nimplants are the major method to alter the strain and increase \nbone density in the edentulous jaws. Continuously loaded \nimplants remain stable within the bone with bone formation in \nareas under compression and the orientation of trabeculae cor-\nresponding to lines of stress.104 As bone responds to physiologic \nforces, a gradual increase in loads during prosthetic fabrication \nstimulates an increase in density. The implementation of pro-\ngressive loading is more critical for lesser bone densities because \nthey are several times weaker than loads with signiicant cortical \nbone. Parafunction, cantilevers, and other stress magniiers can \nincrease the forces applied to the prosthesis and their shear \ncomponents and cause bone microfracture or microstrains in \nthe pathologic zone around the implant.105 Progressive bone \nloading aims at increasing the density of bone, decreasing the \nrisk of implant-bone failure, and decreasing crestal bone loss.\nProgressive Loading Protocol\nFull-arch prostheses with little or no cantilever and adequate \nimplant number, position, and size rarely require progressive \nloading unless the bone density is poor. The favorable bio-\nmechanics of an arch are even compatible with immediate \nocclusal load applications.100 However, the fewer the number \nof implants or the softer the bone types, the more progressive \nloading is needed and recommended.\nCantilevers, patient force factors, and implant position \nmay inluence risk factors in implant dentistry. Poor bone \ndensity may compromise implant success even when key \nimplant position and number are satisfactory. In addition, \ncrestal bone loss may be reduced with progressive loading.\nFIG 17.81 (A) An implant interface after initial healing is \nweaker than the day of surgery because woven bone is pri-\nmarily present next to the implant. (B) After loading, the \nimplant-bone interface is stronger than the original bone con-\ndition because the bone remodels in relation to the local \nstrain condition.

Woven bone is the fastest and irst type of bone \nto form around the implant interface; however, it is mineral-\nized only partly and demonstrates an unorganized structure \nless able to withstand full-scale stresses. At 16 weeks, the sur-\nrounding bone is only 70% mineralized and still exhibits \nwoven bone as a component. Computer-aided radiographic \ndensitometry studies conirm that the bone-implant interface \ndecreases the irst several months after surgical insertion of \nan implant.106 The percentage of bone mineralization and the \ntype of supporting bone inluence whether a load to the \nbone-implant interface is within its physiologic limits.\nIt has been reported that the bone-implant contact is \nrelated to the bone density and the healing time. For example, \nin a study by Carr et al,107 the bone-implant contact was \ngreater in the mandible than the maxilla (the mandible is \nusually more dense). In addition, the bone-implant contact \nwas greater at 6 months compared with 3 months in both \njaws. An increase in bone-implant contact occurred in both \nthe maxilla and the mandible between 3 and 6 months and \nranged from a 7% to 9% increase (Fig. 17.82). The healing \ntime before implant loading may be related to the density of \nbone because the strength of bone increases and the bone-\nimplant contact increases with a longer time period. A period \nof 3–4 months of healing for D1 and D2 bone and a period \nof 5–6 months for D3 and D4 bone have less risk than a \nshorter time period for all bone types. The time period \nbetween surgical placement and full occlusal loading is vari-\nable, depending on the bone density.\nThe macroscopic coarse trabecular bone heals approxi-\nmately 50% faster than dense cortical bone. Although it heals \nmore slowly, D1 bone has the greatest strength and greater \nbecause the transitional prosthesis often remains removable \nduring the prosthesis fabrication. In addition, most of the \nforces placed onto the implants for a screw-retained bar or \nprosthesis are generated at the delivery from nonpassive \nsuperstructures. As a result, screw-retained prostheses do not \nuse a progressive loading protocol.\nA longer healing time between stage I and stage II is sug-\ngested when forces are greater or bone is softer. This time \nallows greater mineralization of bone and a more mature \nlamellar bone interface to form next to the implants before \nthe load of the screws is applied to the implant bodies.\nThe progressive loading protocol has ive different methods \nto gradually load the bone or to increase the bone density \naround the implant (Box 17.6).

During this time, the bone contact percentage \ncan increase, and the ine woven bone trabeculae can mature \ninto coarser lamellar trabeculae, with an increase in mineral \ncontent. The progressive loading process is more critical for \nD3 bone than for D2 or D1 bone because of its weakness and \nless initial bone contact.\nIn D4 bone, the progressive bone loading protocol is most \ncritical. When scheduling restorative appointments, one \nshould err on the side of safety; the appointments should be \nseparated by at least 4 weeks. As a consequence, the overall \ntreatment time for D4 bone is twice that of D1 or D2 bone \nand at least 9 months (including 6 months of initial healing). \nThis schedule allows suficient time for mature lamellar, min-\neralized bone to develop at the interface and increases the \nnumbers of trabeculae in direct contact and within the \nnetwork region of the implant (Table 17.4).\nWhen the dentist uses multiple implants, the weakest bone \narea determines the gradual load protocol.

The suggested healing time between \nthe initial and second-stage surgeries is similar for D1 and D2 \nbone and is 3–4 months. A longer time is suggested for the \ninitial healing phase of D3 and D4 bone (5 and 6 months, \nrespectively) because of the lesser bone contact and decreased \namount of cortical bone to allow for the maturation of the \ninterface and the development of some lamellar bone. In very \nimmature bone, the healing time may be 8 months.\nThe D4 implant-bone interface typically found in poste-\nrior regions of the maxilla exhibits minimum initial bone \ncontact, with little to no cortical bone at the crest or apex. An \nimplant surgery initially may trigger an increase in the \namount of bone in the region. For example, bone has been \nshown to grow in contact with a submerged titanium screw \ninserted into an open marrow chamber of the femur.108 The \ninitial increase of bone cell activity most likely results from \nthe surgical trauma and the regional acceleratory phenome-\nnon. The longer initial healing time is most beneicial to the \npoorest bone density types. In softer bone, a longer period of \ntime of initial healing and gradual loading is suggested. Gen-\nerally, D1 bone uses a period of 3 or more months before \nloading, D2 bone uses a period of 4 or more months, D3 bone \nuses a period of 5 or more months, and D4 bone uses a period \nof 6 or more months.\nThe combined observations of the macroscopic amount \nof bone in contact with a nonloaded implant and the micro-\nscopic type of bone at the stage II surgery of the implant \ndemonstrates a wide difference in D1 to D4 bone densities. \nHowever, the long-term major improvement in bone density \nand strength occurs as a consequence of loading the implant.\nFour prosthodontic steps are suggested for the reconstruc-\ntion of a partially or completely edentulous patient, with \nendosteal implants supporting a cemented prosthesis. Each \nof the four major prosthodontic appointments also are sepa-\nrated by a period of time related to the bone density observed \nat the initial time of surgery. In addition, the dentist attempts \nto gradually increase the load to the implant at each prosthetic \nstep. The four prosthetic steps are (1) abutment insertion, \npreparation, inal impression, and temporary (of the esthetic \nzone); (2) a metal try-in and new bite registration; (3) initial \ndelivery of the prosthesis; and (4) inal evaluation of the \nrestoration and hygiene appointment.

In \ncompletely edentulous patients, the tissue surface of the \ndenture is relieved at least 5 mm over and around the implants \nand replaced by a tissue conditioner. The conditioner also is \nrelieved a few millimeters.\nThe patient returns in 2 weeks for suture removal and \nto replace the tissue conditioner with a soft liner. The \nAfter being uncovered, the implant connected to an abut-\nment for cement retention is at greater risk of loading during \nmastication. The patient is limited to a soft diet such as pasta \nand ish from the inal impression stage until the initial deliv-\nery of the inal prosthesis. The masticatory force for this type \nof food is approximately 10 psi. This diet not only minimizes \nthe masticatory force on the implants but also decreases the \nrisk of temporary restoration fracture or a partially unce-\nmented restoration. Either of these consequences can over-\nload an implant and cause unwanted complications.\nThe diet should not be overlooked during the restorative \nphase of treatment. Most dentists have observed the fracture \nof an acrylic prosthesis with harder foods and greater occur-\nrence of uncemented restorations when they ignore the type \nof diet during the transitional prosthesis stages.\nAfter the initial delivery of the inal prosthesis, the patient \nmay include meat in the diet, which requires approximately \n21 psi in bite force. The inal restoration can bear the greater \nforce without risk of fracture or uncementation. After the \ninal evaluation appointment, the patient may include raw \nvegetables, which require an average 27 psi of force.\nA normal diet is permitted only after evaluation of the \ninal prosthesis function, occlusion, and proper cementation. \nThe most damaging forces to a transitional (or inal) restora-\ntion are from parafunction, not the function of eating. After \nthe prosthesis is placed into occlusion, the evaluation of para-\nfunction and methods to reduce its negative side effects are \ncritical to the loading process.\nOcclusal Material. The occlusal material may be varied to \ngradually load the bone-implant interface. During the initial \nsteps, the implant has no occlusal contact and in essence has \nno material over it. At subsequent appointments, the dentist \nuses acrylic as the occlusal material, with the beneit of a \nlower impact force than metal or porcelain. Either metal or \nporcelain can be used as the inal occlusal material.\nIf parafunction or cantilever length causes concern relative \nto the amount of force on the early implant-bone interface, \nthe dentist may extend the softer diet and acrylic restoration \nphase several months. In this way, the bone has a longer time \nto mineralize and organize to accommodate the higher forces.\nOcclusal Contacts. The dentist gradually intensiies the \nocclusal contacts during prosthesis fabrication. No occlusal \ncontacts are permitted during initial healing (step 1). The irst \ntransitional prosthesis is left out of occlusion in partially \nedentulous patients (step 2). The occlusal contacts then are \nsimilar to those of the inal restoration for areas supported \nby implants. However, no occlusal contacts are made on can-\ntilevers or offset loads (step 3).\nProsthesis Design. There are four potential prostheses \ndesigns in a restorative process. During initial healing, the \ndentist attempts to avoid any load on the implants, including \nsoft tissue loads. In a completely edentulous patient, relief \nand a soft tissue conditioner (also relieved) may be used. The \nirst transitional acrylic restoration in partially edentulous \nFIG 17.83 A permucosal extension was placed by the \nsurgeon at the implant insertion or at stage II uncover. Ideally, \nthe soft tissue is healed before prosthetic reconstruction. \n(From Misch CE: Dental implant prosthetics, ed 2, St Louis, \n2015, Mosby.)"

Metal superstructure try-in and transitional prosthesis II\n3. Initial insertion of inal prosthesis\n4. Final evaluation and hygiene\nSUMMARY\nThe prosthodontic rehabilitation of patients with dental \nimplants is one of the most complicated and complex parts \nof dentistry. The occlusal loading of the implant prosthesis is \nmuch different than traditional prosthetic principles on \nnatural teeth. In the earliest years of the discipline, implant \ndentistry primarily existed as a multidisciplinary, team-based \npractice. Surgical principles were followed for implant place-\nment, and restorative concepts were then put into action that \ncreated prostheses for the integrated implants. In many \ninstances, the surgical and prosthetic plans lacked cohesive-\nness in design and planning, resulting in numerous complica-\ntions and failures.\nAs knowledge regarding implant dentistry has increased, \nwe now see the importance of blending these phases together. \nThe occlusion scheme for implant-supported prostheses \nbecomes most important to the longevity of the restoration \nbecause that scheme will dictate biomechanical stress place-\nment along integrated implants. Failure to account for these \nfundamentals of implant occlusion will result in numerous \ncomplications in both the prosthesis and the implants proper.\nIt is paramount that any clinician, whether on the surgical, \nrestorative, or both ends of implant treatment, be well versed \nin occlusal design before commencing with therapy. Force \nfactors may need to be addressed, bone volumes may need to \nbe augmented to allow for larger diameter (or more) implants, \nand key implant positions may need to be modiied to offset \npotential loads. Knowing the optimal occlusal concept for a \nFIG 17.84 (A) Only the lingual cusps of the maxillary ana-\ntomic posterior teeth occlude with the mandibular teeth. This \nbrings the occlusal contact closer to the crestal bone support \nand helps stabilize the denture. (B) The mandibular teeth have \nocclusal contact in the central fossa; the buccal cusps are \nreduced in height, with no occlusal contact in centric occlu-\nsion.

Bone augmentation is often \nindicated.\n• Implants should always be splinted together to distribute \nforces. Most often facial cantilevers are present because of \nthe residual ridge resorption, which increases the moment \nforce (see Fig. 17.87).\n• Crown height space should always be evaluated in the ante-\nrior region because it is a force magniier, which increases \nthe cantilever effect.\n• Progressive bone loading is often indicated because of inher-\nent poor bone quality in the premaxilla (approximately D3 \nbone quality).\n• Occlusal guard is indicated when parafunction is present.\nBOX 17.9 Occlusal Recommendations for Multiple Implants—Posterior \nImplant-Supported Restorations\n• Number of implants: Usually one implant for each tooth \nreplacement (e.g., fewer implants indicated when favorable \nforce factors are present).\n• Interbone distance between implants: approximately 3 mm.\n• Splinting of implants indicated to increase force distribution.\n• Narrow occlusal table.\n• Minimal cusp height.\n• Avoid nonaxial loading.\n• Avoid cantilevers when possible (e.g., biomechanically a \nmesial cantilever is more favorable than a distal cantilever).\n• Infraocclusion on cantilever part of occlusal table.\n• Maintain excursive guidance on healthy natural teeth while \ndiscluding the posterior implant segment.\n• Centric contacts should be evenly placed over occlusal table \ncorresponding to implant positions.\n• Crossbite may be used when indicated.\n• Use of occlusal guards is indicated especially when parafunc-\ntional forces are present.\n• Kennedy Class I (bilateral posterior edentulous) and II (unilat-\neral posterior edentulous): No protrusive contacts, narrow \nocclusal table, minimal cusp height, timed occlusal \ncontacts.\n• Kennedy Class III (edentulous space with anterior and pos-\nterior natural teeth): Timed occlusal contacts, disclusion is \ndetermined by natural tooth incisal guidance.\nBOX 17.10 Occlusal Recommendations for Fully Edentulous Implant Fixed Prosthesis\n• Implant number:\nMaxilla: 6–9 implants (e.g., <6 implants is controversial)\nMandible: 5–7 implants (e.g., <5 implants is controversial)\n• Angulation—implant position to be lingual to incisal edge.\n• Splinting—should always be completed on maxilla and man-\ndible except on mandible when bilateral implants posterior \nto the mental foramen (i.e., separate prosthesis usually sepa-\nrated distal to the cuspid on one side).\n• Cantilever—amount of cantilever depends on force factors; \ncantilever should be in infraocclusion (approximately 100 µm).\n• Occlusion—is dependent on opposing arch, skeletal relation-\nship, and force factors; however, anteroposterior simultane-\nous contacts in centric relation and maximal intercuspation \nposition.\n• Shallow anterior guidance when opposing natural teeth.\n• Freedom in centric relation (1–1.5 mm).\n• Occlusal guard when parafunction is present.\nBOX 17.11 Occlusal Recommendations for Fully Edentulous Implant Removable Prosthesis\n• Implant number:\nMaxilla: 4–8 implants depending on RP-4 or RP-5 (e.g., <4 \nimplants is controversial).\nMandible: 2–5 implants depending on RP-4 or RP-5 (e.g., 2 \nimplants is controversial).\n• Angulation—implant position to be center of ridge.\n• Implant position—dependent on number of implants and \nanteroposterior spread.\n• Anteroposterior simultaneous contacts in centric relation and \nmaximal intercuspation position.\n• Occlusion—bilateral balance occlusion (i.e., medial posi-\ntioned lingualized occlusion), true balanced occlusion oppos-\ning natural teeth may be dificult to obtain (i.e., minimum of \nthree-point balance contacts on lateral and excursions). For \npoor ridge form (i.e., Division D, severe posterior ridge \nresorption), monoplane occlusion may be used.\n• Support—usually bar-retained implant overdentures are \nimplant supported (RP-4), and stud attachments usually \nexhibit primary soft tissue support (RP-5)."

Misch\n18 \nImplant dentistry has evolved into an evidence-based, clinical \nscience with well-documented research to validate previously \nunsupported clinical practice procedures. Signiicant efforts that \nfocus on the biology and biomechanics of implant dentistry \nhave helped develop and reine clinical techniques based on \npeer-reviewed indings. The evolution of research and under-\nstanding of biologic concepts in implant dentistry has caused \nmany areas of conlict and controversy. Innovative theories have \nbeen developed that have resulted in technique changes. Science \nhas spurred implant dentistry to new pinnacles of success.\nThe tremendous expansion of knowledge in this ield has \ncreated new ideas and terminology that is redeined based on \nnew principles. In many instances, new research may contra-\ndict established paradigms. It may be confusing for clinicians \nto select correct protocols, procedures, instruments, and tech-\nniques. As materials and techniques are further investigated, \ndogma may undergo criticism and controversy. Seasoned \nclinicians consistently update and modify techniques and \ninstruments to maintain clinical excellence as technology and \nresearch advance.\nOne area of expansion of knowledge and conlict of views \nrelates to the maintenance of dental implants. Early research \nexplored techniques and instruments that were current for the \nmethods and materials of that time. Although many of those \nimplants still exist and are functional in patients, research \nand advances in technology have given us newer materials \nand advances in implant design and structure, minimizing \nprevious challenges from a maintenance perspective.\nAn understanding of the mucoepithelial implant attach-\nment is essential before commencing maintenance proce-\ndures. Controversies and parameters for probing and crestal \nbone loss are important for clinicians to recognize. There are \nanatomic and histologic differences between the attachment \napparatus of teeth compared with implants that have under-\ngone osseointegration. The bacterial plaque bioilm chal-\nlenges on these implant-tissue attachments may be signiicant \nto clinical success.\nWhen the clinician understands the parameters of implants \nand teeth, speciic maintenance plans may be established for \nthe patient. Clinicians should inform patients of expectations \nand outcomes during treatment and demonstrate oral hygiene \noptions appropriate during each stage. Patients need to recog-\nnize the importance of maintenance protocols, and clinicians \nshould assess compliance to home care routines. Patients \nalso should be competent to perform home maintenance \nprocedures. As the acceptance of and demand for dental \nimplants increase, the need to understand the importance of \nmaintenance as it relates to long-term implant success also \nincreases. The role of the dental hygienist in implant mainte-\nnance and care is also increasing and becoming more deined.\nImplants and associated prostheses are much different than \nnatural teeth and may require adjunctive procedures and instru-\nments for professional and patient care. Complications may \narise when clinicians fail to comprehend these differences, \nwhich may increase the morbidity of treatment. The instrumen-\ntation utilized must be effective at removing bioilms and accre-\ntions, and procedures performed by patients and clinicians \nshould avoid damage to all components of the implant, abut-\nment, restoration, and associated tissue. Establishment and \nmaintenance of the soft tissue seal around the transmucosal \nportion of the implant enhances the success of an implant. This \nbarrier is fundamentally a result of appropriate wound healing \nand connection of epithelial attachments. The maintenance of \nhealthy peri-implant tissues may contribute to implant success. \nIn addition, tissues free of inlammation and a bioilm-free \nimplant sulcus will support the patient’s general and oral health.\nPERI-IMPLANT DISEASE\nDIAGNOSIS\nComplication\nOne important but often neglected component of compre-\nhensive dental implant treatment is the postoperative evalua-\ntion and treatment of peri-implant issues. There are many \nconlicting thoughts and controversies on the diagnosis and \ntreatment of these complications. Failure to effectively and \npromptly diagnose and treat peri-implant disease with dental \nimplants leads to an increase in implant and prosthetic failure.\nEtiology\nDental professionals are initially trained to have a irm under-\nstanding of the disease processes associated with the natural \ndentition. A variety of tests, indices, and radiographic signs \nare used to determine the health of a natural tooth. Dental \nimplants and their related prostheses have fundamentally dif-\nferent relationships to the oral environment than teeth, and \nthese differences necessitate a change in diagnostic protocol \nfor the determination of health. Failure to understand these \ndifferences may lead to a lack of recognition of early disease"

Without early intervention, increased morbidity \nmay result.\nPrevention\nThe following section of this chapter will outline various \nanatomic and histologic differences between natural denti-\ntion and the dental implant as they pertain to periodontal \nstructures. By having this background established, the clini-\ncian may appreciate these necessary differences and will be \nbetter equipped to effectively diagnose peri-implant disease \nprocesses. Inlammatory conditions around dental implants \nor dental implant prostheses are collectively deined as peri-\nimplant disease. The most common terms accepted in implant \ndentistry, peri-mucositis and peri-implantitis, originated from \nthe First European Workshop on Periodontology in 1994.1 \nThese terms remain current with slight modiications and \nhave similar comparisons to periodontal diseases around \nnatural teeth (i.e., gingivitis, periodontitis).2 An implant cli-\nnician should have a thorough understanding of the related \ndeinitions.\nGingivitis is a bacteria-induced inlammation involving \nthe region of the marginal gingiva above the crest of bone \nand next to a natural tooth. It is always associated with plaque \nand may be classiied as (1) acute necrotizing, (2) ulcerative, \n(3) hormonal, (4) drug induced, or (5) spontaneously occur-\nring.3 These categories also can relate to the gingival tissues \naround an implant because the mode of attachment of the \ngingiva to a tooth and implant has been reported to be par-\ntially similar.4\nThe bacteria responsible for gingivitis around a tooth may \naffect the epithelial attachment without loss of connective \ntissue attachment. Because the connective tissue attachment \nof a tooth extends an average of 1.07 mm above the crestal \nbone, at least 1 mm of protective barrier above the bone is \nleft. In contrast, no connective tissue attachment zone exists \naround an implant because no connective ibers extend into \nthe implant surface. Therefore, no connective tissue barrier \nexists to protect the crestal bone around an implant.5\nPeriodontitis around teeth is characterized by apical move-\nment of junctional epithelium and periodontal attachment \ncoupled with loss of alveolar bone. Bacteria is thought to be \nresponsible by stimulating the body’s immune response, \nwhich results in an overall resorptive effect on the periodontal \nattachment apparatus. The American Academy of Periodon-\ntology recognizes two main types of periodontitis: chronic \nand aggressive periodontitis. Each encompasses many speciic \nsubtypes for each category such as adult chronic periodontitis, \nprogressive periodontitis, localized juvenile, prepubertal, etc.\nIn contrast to teeth, early crestal bone loss around an \nimplant postprosthetically usually is not caused by bacteria. \nMost often the bone loss results from stress factors too great \nfor the immature, incompletely mineralized bone-implant \ninterface or an extension of the biologic width onto a smooth \nmetal crest module.6 An implant may exhibit early crestal \nbone loss with a different mechanism or cause compared with \nnatural teeth. However, on occasion, bacteria may be the \nprimary factor. Anaerobic bacteria have been observed in the \nmicrogap between the implant and the abutment or in the \nsulcus of implants, especially when sulcus depths are greater \nthan 5 mm (Box 18.1).7\nPeriodontal disease that develops around dental implants \nhas been classiied into two separate entities: peri-implant \nmucositis and peri-implantitis. These classiications were \nproposed via a consensus report from the First European \nWorkshop on Periodontology (EWOP). Peri-implant muco-\nsitis was deined as a reversible inlammatory reaction in the \nperi-implant tissues surrounding an implant, and peri-\nimplantitis is deined as inlammatory reactions with loss of \nsupporting bone around an implant.1\nPeriimplant mucositis is an inlammatory condition of the \nsoft tissue surrounding an implant, which is similar to gingi-\nvitis around a tooth. This has been deined as a reversible \ncondition with no loss of attachment or bone loss. The \nprimary etiologic factor has been shown to be plaque bioilm, \nthe removal of which easily reverses the disease process. If \nallowed to progress, peri-implantitis may result, which \nincludes loss of bone and loss of osseointegration, similar to \nloss of attachment and bone with periodontitis. The preva-\nlence of peri-implant mucositis (bleeding on probing and no \nloss of bone) has been shown to be approximately 79% to \n90% of subjects and 50% of implants.8\nPeri-implantitis exhibits similar microbial lora as adult \nperiodontitis. Changes involve both the hard and soft tissues \nsurrounding an implant. The implant may exhibit all the \nsigns of peri-implant mucositis as well as exudate, increased \npocket depth, and bone loss. If left untreated, signiicant bone \nloss, infection, and mobility could result, leading to the failure \nof an initially integrated implant. According to Mombelli \net al, the microbiota are site speciic and similar to chronic \nadult periodontitis.9 The clinical signs include radiographic \nor probing vertical bone loss, peri-implant pockets, bleeding \nupon probing (with or without exudate), mucosal swelling \nand redness, and an absence of pain (Box 18.2). The crestal \nbone loss may be induced by stress, bacteria, or a combina-\ntion of both. Stress-induced bone loss occurs without bacte-\nria as the primary causative agent. However, after the bone \nloss from stress or bacteria, the sulcular crevice deepens and \ndecreases the oxygen tension, and anaerobic bacteria may"

The factors that \ndictate the movement include: the number and length of the \nroot surface, the root diameter, shape, position, health of the \nperiodontal attachment apparatus, and the bone density pri-\nmarily inluence a tooth’s mobility.

Lack of implant mobility (IM) does \nnot always coincide with a direct bone-implant interface. \nHowever, when observed clinically, rigid ixation usually \nmeans that at least a portion of the implant is in direct contact \nwith bone, although the percentage of bone contact cannot \nbe speciied. When an implant has mobility, there is most \nlikely connective tissue between the implant and bone.\nIn some situations, the presence of implant mobility may \nbe dificult to discern. The absence of clinically observable \nmovement does not indicate the true absence of any move-\nment. For example, a “nonmobile” posterior natural tooth \nactually moves horizontally 56 to 73 µm. The human eye does \nnot perceive this movement. The anterior teeth, which often \nand is the same for anterior and posterior teeth.11 The vertical \nmovement of a rigid, ixated implant has been measured to \nbe approximately 2 to 3 µm under a 10-lb force and is due \nmostly to the viscoelastic properties of the underlying bone.12\nMuhlemann found that horizontal tooth movement may \nbe divided into initial mobility and secondary movement.13 \nThe initial mobility is observed when there is a light force \napplied, which occurs immediately, and is a consequence of \nthe periodontal ligament (PDL). Initial horizontal tooth \nmobility is greater than initial vertical movement. A very light \nforce (500 g) may horizontally move a tooth. The initial hori-\nzontal mobility of a healthy, “nonmobile” posterior tooth is \nless than that of an anterior tooth and ranges from 56 to \n75 µm, which is two to nine times the vertical movement of \nthe tooth. Initial horizontal mobility is even greater in ante-\nrior teeth and ranges from 70 to 108 µm in health (Fig. 18.2).14\nThe secondary tooth movement described by Muhlemann \noccurs after the initial movement when greater forces are \napplied. When an additional force is applied to the tooth, a \nsecondary movement is also observed, which is related directly \nto the amount of force. The secondary tooth movement is \nrelated to the viscoelasticity of the bone and measures as \nmuch as 40 µm under considerably greater force (Fig. 18.3).13\nImplant movement. The term rigid ixation is used to \ndescribe the absence of clinical mobility of an implant tested \nwith vertical or horizontal forces less than 500 g. However, \nrigid ixation is a clinical term. Osseointegration is a histologic \nterm that is deined as bone in direct contact with an implant \nsurface at the magniication of a light microscope (Fig. \nFIG 18.2 The physiologic movement of a healing tooth has \nbeen measured as 28 µm in the apical direction and up to \n108 µm in the horizontal direction.

The IM scale was \nused frequently for plate (blade) form implants or disc \nimplants because a clinical goal was for slight mobility when \njoining the device to natural teeth. However, the ideal goal for \nroot form implants should always be rigid ixation and IM-0 \nstatus (no movement).\nPeriotest. The Periotest (Gulden-Medizinteknik) is a \ncomputer-mechanical device, developed by Schulte, that \nmeasures the dampening effect or attenuation degree against \nobjects by developing a force of 12 to 18 N against a piston-\nlike device, which then measures the distance the piston \nrecoils into the chamber after striking an object.19 A soft \nsurface or mobile object gives higher recordings than a hard \nor rigid object. The recordings range from negative 8 to posi-\ntive 50 numbers.\nTeeth with zero clinical mobility have typical Periotest \nranges from 5 to 9. The degree or absence of clinical move-\nment around an implant corresponds to values ranging from \n−8 to +9, or a range of 17 units. The bone density around the \nhave slight clinically observable movement, actually move \napproximately 0.1 mm. A healthy implant may move less than \n73 µm; it appears as zero clinical mobility (rigid ixation).\nSimilar to a natural tooth, the implant-bone interface \nexhibits more lateral than apical movement. Sekine et al \nevaluated the movement of endosteal implants with rigid \nixation and found a range of 12 to 66 µm of movement in \nthe labiolingual direction.12 Komiyama reported 40 to 115 µm \nof implant movement in the mesiodistal direction under a \nforce of 2000 g (≈4.5 psi) and a labiolingual range of 11 to \n66 µm.16 The greater implant movement in the mesiodistal \ndimension corresponds to the lack of cortical bone between \nthe implants in this direction compared with the thicker \nlateral cortical plates present in the labiolingual dimension. \nRangert et al suggested that part of this implant movement \nmay also be due to component lexure of the implant abut-\nment and screw.17 The mobility of implants varies in direct \nproportion to the load applied and the bone density and \nrelects the elastic deformation of bone tissue.\nSekine et al applied a gradually increasing load over a \n2-second period to a tooth and an implant. The teeth moved \nimmediately with a light load (primary tooth movement) and \nless with an additional load (secondary tooth movement). \nThe implant did not move when the tooth had its primary \ntooth movement. A heavier force caused the implant to grad-\nually move, similar to the secondary tooth movement (see \nFig. 18.3).12 These mobility characteristics corroborate the \nindings of Fenton et al, who applied a 500-g load for 4 \nseconds to maxillary anterior teeth and osseointegrated \nimplants.18 Whereas the implants were displaced a mean of \n10 µm with a rapid elastic return (less than 1 millisecond), \nthe teeth showed a mean displacement of 57 µm with a pro-\nlonged viscoelastic return.\nEvaluating Dental Implant Mobility\nMirror handles. Increased tooth mobility may be caused \nby many factors including occlusal trauma or bone loss. \nIncreased tooth mobility alone is not a criterion of periodon-\ntal health or pathology. Unlike a tooth, for which mobility is \nnot a primary factor for longevity, mobility is a primary \ndetermining factor for implant health.15 Rigid ixation of an \nimplant is also an excellent indicator of the implant health \nstatus because it is an easy, objective test. As such, rigid ixa-\ntion is usually the irst clinical criterion evaluated for a dental \nimplant. The techniques to assess rigid ixation are similar to \nthose used for natural tooth mobility. Two rigid instruments \napply a labiolingual force of approximately 500 g, and no \nobserved mobility indicates rigid ixation (Fig. 18.5).3\nThe amplitude of tooth mobility may be rated from 0 to \n4, where 0 is normal mobility from physiologic movement; 1 \nis detectable increased mobility; 2 is visible mobility up to \n0.5 mm; 3 is severe mobility up to 1 mm; and 4 is extreme \nmobility, including vertical movement.3 This same gradient \nmay be used for oral implants with slight modiication.

Similar to teeth, clini-\ncal indings of failing implants include inlammation, pockets, \nand progressive bone loss. Another similarity lies in the bacteria \nresponsible for periodontitis and peri-implantitis.\nWhen evaluating the peri-implant microbiota, Lee et al. \ncompared microbial changes between patients with a history of \nperiodontal or peri-implant infections and implants that have \nbeen in function for a length of time.28 This study found a \nhistory of periodontitis had a greater impact on the peri-implant \nmicrobiota than implant loading time. The major inluence on \nthe peri-implant microbiota was, however, the microbiota on \nremaining teeth. Porphyromonas gingivalis and Bacteroides for-\nsythus (Tannerella forsythia), red complex periodontal patho-\ngens, colonized several implants, although all implants were \nsuccessfully osteointegrated. It is important to educate patients \nabout their responsibility to decrease plaque effectively, espe-\ncially if they have a history of periodontal disease.\nPlaque bioilm development and maturation have simi-\nlarities for natural teeth and dental implants. The gingival \nsulcus in periodontal health and the perimucosal attachment \nof a successful dental implant are essentially similar. In a \nstudy by Mombelli and Mericske-Stern of the plaque from 18 \nedentulous patients with successful dental implants, faculta-\ntive anaerobic cocci (52.8%) and facultative anaerobic rods \n(17.4%) were reported.\nHowever, the pathogens P. gingivalis and spirochetes \nwere absent, and minimal (7.3%) gram-negative rods were \npresent.29 Generally, pellicle—a naturally occurring glycopro-\ntein in the saliva—irst adheres to the intraoral structure, \nwhether it be a tooth or an implant. Gram-positive cocci \nbacteria are the irst “early colonizers,” beginning with single \ncocci and progressing to streptococci forms (Box 18.3).\nWithout appropriate oral hygiene measures (e.g., brushing, \nlossing, interdental cleaning), additional bacterial colonies \nincluding gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria synergistically \ngrow with the established gram-positive bacteria. The gram-\nnegative bacteria are frequently facultative or strict anaerobic \nbacteria and are considered “late colonizers.” Many, if not the \nmajority, of these gram-negative bacteria are black pigmented \nand are classiied under a number of genera (e.g., Bacteroides, \nPrevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium).\nPlaque bioilm reported to be associated with failing \ndental implants also consists largely of gram-negative rods.30 \nimplant may be correlated with Periotest numbers. Whereas \nsofter bone types give higher numbers, harder bone around \nthe implant results in lower numbers. A nondestructive reso-\nnance frequency analysis technique to measure implant sta-\nbility and osteointegration has also been introduced to the \nprofession and provides similar valuable information as to \nthe clinical movement and bone density around implants \n(Table 18.2).20,21\nOsstell. A second device exists to evaluate the implant-\nbone interface that is nondestructive and noninvasive. The \nOsstell (Ostell) is based on resonance frequency analysis (RFA) \nand was developed by Huang.22 The Osstell has been shown to \nhave quantitative and reproducible measurements on the pres-\nence of integration, immediate load feasibility, and follow-up \nevaluation at the prediction of an implant failure. RFA is a \ntechnique that is based on continual excitation of the implant \ninterface through the use of dynamic vibration analysis (piezo \neffect). A specialized transducer, which contains two piezoc-\neramic elements, is either attached directly to the implant or \nabutment. The irst piezo element generates an excitation \nsignal that is a sinusoidal wave (5–15 kHz), leading to vibra-\ntion of a whole transducer-implant-tissue complex. The oscil-\nlation response is measured by the second piezo element.23\nThe RFA technique measures implant stability as a function \nof stiffness of the bone/implant complex. The health of the \nimplant is measured on an implant stability quotient (ISQ) \nthat is calculated on a scale from 1 to 100. The full integration \nof an implant is most usually measured in the range from 45 \nto 85 ISQ. Measurements of less than 45 are indicative of \nimplant failure, whereas an ISQ value of 60 to 70 indicates \nsuccess.24 Studies have shown that the Osstell is more reliable \nthan the Periotest in evaluating and measuring implant stabil-\nity in hard and soft tissue interfaces (Fig. 18.6 and Table 18.3).25\nPLAQUE BIOFILM\nThe differences between tooth and implant biologies make \ndental implants more susceptible to inlammation and bone \nloss in the presence of bacterial plaque accumulation.26 Bioilms \nare the primary causative factor of periodontal disease pro-\ncesses.

In \nthe past, percussion was used to evaluate the presence of rigid \nixation for osseointegrated implants.15 However, percussion \nis an indicator neither of clinical health nor of rigid ixation \nfor osseointegrated implants. The ringing sound that occurs \non percussion only corresponds to the presence of some \namount of bone at the interface because 2 mm of bone and \n16 mm of bone-implant interface sound almost identical.\nClinical Signiicance\nPercussion may be used to diagnose pain or tenderness with \nan implant but is misleading if used to determine the status \nof rigid ixation.\nPROBING DEPTHS\nProbing depths around teeth is an excellent proven means to \nassess the past and present health of natural teeth. The \nincreasing sulcus depth around natural teeth is directly \nrelated to disease and bone loss. However, probing depth \nindices used to evaluate dental implants are more controver-\nsial because implant sulcus depth and health are not always \ndirectly related. A thorough appreciation of the soft tissue \ninterface is needed for the clinician to understand the inher-\nent differences between natural teeth and dental implants.\nSoft Tissue Interface Around Teeth and Implants\nFor a natural tooth the surrounding soft tissue has an average \nbiologic width of 2.04 mm between the depth of the sulcus \nand the crest of the alveolar bone. It should be noted the \nbiologic “width” is actually a height dimension with a greater \nrange in the posterior region compared with the anterior and \nmay be greater than 4 mm in height.39 With respect to natural \nteeth, the biologic width is composed of a connective tissue \nattachment (1.07 mm average) above the bone and a junc-\ntional epithelial attachment (JEA) (0.97 mm average) at the \nsulcus base, with the most consistent value among individuals \nbeing the connective tissue attachment (Fig. 18.7).\nand bone loss. If left untreated, signiicant bone loss, infec-\ntion, and mobility could result, leading to the failure of an \ninitially integrated implant.\nComparisons of plaque bioilms have been reported in a \nlimited study of Brånemark and ITI (Straumann Institute) \nimplants and are remarkably similar in controlled studies. \nMombelli et al compared 10 patients with Brånemark \nimplants and 10 patients with ITI implants and sampled the \ndeepest pockets around the implants.35 After 3 and 6 months, \nseveral periodontal pathogens were cultured and isolated, \nincluding P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, Fusobacterium nuclea-\ntum, and various spirochetes. None of the implants were \ncolonized by A. actinomycetemcomitans. Longer investiga-\ntions by Leonhardt et al extended these microlora reports on \ndental implants in 19 patients. At 3 years, the osteointegrated \nimplants were colonized predominantly by P. gingivalis, P. \nintermedia, and A. actinomycetemcomitans.36\nNatural dentitions with dental implants appear to increase \nthe risk for implant infections, compared with completely \nedentulous patients. This suggests that natural teeth may \nserve as a reservoir for periodontal pathogens that may extend \ntheir growth to contiguous implants in the same oral cavity.37 \nQuirynen and Listgarten reported that proportions of coccoid \nforms (65.8%), motile rods (2.3%), and spirochetes (2.1%) \nin implant pocket areas were similar to the microorganisms \nin natural teeth (55.6%, 4.9%, and 3.6%, respectively). Fully \nedentulous patients exhibited more coccoid forms (71.3%), \nfewer motile rods (0.4%), and no spirochetes.38 They also \nconcluded that microlora in partially edentulous implant \npatients were potentially more pathogenic than they were in \nfully edentulous patients. Implants with longevity of more \nthan 3 or 4 years appear to have greater numbers of bacteria \nthan implants in place for 1 or 2 years.\nClinical Signiicance\nPlaque bioilms are the main reason peri-implantitis treat-\nments fail.

The rete peg formation \nwithin the attached gingiva and the histologic lining of the \ngingiva within the sulcus are similar in implants and teeth.40 \nA free gingival margin forms around a tooth or implant with \nnonkeratinized sulcular epithelium, and the epithelial cells at \nits base are also similar to teeth and implants, with junctional \nepithelial cells for both. However, a fundamental difference \ncharacterizes the base of the gingival complex around teeth. \nWhereas a tooth has two primary regions that make up the \nbiologic width, an implant only has one (Fig. 18.8).\nWhen probing next to a tooth, the probe not only mea-\nsures the sulcus depth but also penetrates and measures the \nJEA.41 The junctional epithelial “attachment” of a tooth is not \na true attachment. It attaches to teeth via hemidesmosomes, \nbut these attachments are light in general and are easily dis-\nrupted. A periodontal probe, plaque, or impression material \ncan easily separate the hemidesmosomal attachment. At the \napex of the sulcus is the junctional epithelium, which is a few \ncells thick and supported by the connective tissue attachment \nzone (see Fig. 18.8).\nThe connective tissue attachment zone of the “biologic \nwidth” around a tooth prevents the probe from penetrating \ndeeper into the sulcus and allows gingival ibers of the con-\nnective tissue attachment zone to establish direct connection \nwith the cementum of the natural tooth. It acts as a physical \nbarrier to the bacteria in the sulcus to the underlining peri-\nodontal tissues. Eleven different gingival iber groups compose \nthe connective tissue attachment zone observed around a \nnatural tooth and tissue: dentogingival (coronal, horizontal, \nand apical), alveologingival, intercapillary, transgingival, cir-\ncular, semicircular, dentoperiosteal, transseptal, periosteogin-\ngival, intercircular, and intergingival.3 At least six of these \ngingival iber groups insert into the cementum of the natural \ntooth: the dentogingival (coronal, horizontal, and apical), \ndentoperiosteal, transseptal, circular, semicircular, and trans-\ngingival ibers. In addition, some crestal ibers from the peri-\nodontal iber bundles also insert into the cementum above \nthe alveolar bone. These Sharpey ibers form a true attach-\nment to the tooth. They prevent a periodontal probe from \ninvading the PDL space and delay the ingress of plaque."

However, collagenous com-\nponents of the linear body cannot physiologically adhere to \nor become embedded into the implant body.26 The hemides-\nmosomal seal has a circumferential band of gingival tissue to \nprovide mechanical protection against tearing. However, the \nmucopolysaccharide layer is less adherent to an implant \nsurface than a natural tooth root. The hemidesmosome of the \nnatural tooth has a lamina lucida and a lamina densa, which \nare part of the basement membrane. The hemidesmosome \nnext to an implant has a lamina lucida, lamina densa, and \nsublamina lucida (which is less adherent).42\nThe biologic width for implants has been reported by \nCochran et al to be 3.3 mm, but unlike the biologic width \ndimension for teeth, they also included the sulcus depth.43 In \na typical implant gingival region, only two of the gingival \niber groups found around a tooth (circular and periosteo-\ngingival ibers) and no periodontal ibers are present.44 These \nibers do not insert into the implant body below the abut-\nment margin as they do into the cementum of natural teeth. \nInstead, the collagen ibers around an implant run parallel to \nthe implant surface, not perpendicular, as with natural teeth.45 \nHence, the implant only has a junctional epithelial “attach-\nment” system.\nThe gingival and periosteal iber groups are responsible for \nthe connective tissue attachment component of the biologic \nwidth around teeth, and these are not present around the \ntransosteal region of an implant. The “biologic width” around \nthe abutment-implant connection should not be similarly \ncompared with the connective tissue attachment of a tooth. \nThe biologic seal around dental implants can prevent the \nmigration of bacteria and endotoxins into the underlying \nbone. It is unable, however, to constitute an attachment com-\nponent of the biologic width similar to the one found with \nnatural teeth (Fig. 18.9).\nConsequences of Probing Around an Implant\nA dental probe introduced into an implant sulcus may \nproceed through the junctional epithelial close approxima-\ntion of tissue and the probe may proceed to the crestal bone \n(Fig. 18.10).\nThe connective tissue zone for an implant has only two \niber groups, and neither of them inserts into the implant. As \na result, with an implant the probe goes beyond the sulcus, \nthrough the JEA, and through the type III collagen connective \ntissues and reaches closer to the bone.46 Because the probe \npenetrates deeper next to an implant compared with a tooth, \none should take care not to contaminate the implant sulcus \nwith bacteria from a diseased periodontal site (Table 18.4).\nThe beneit of probing the implant sulcus has been chal-\nlenged in the literature because sound scientiic criteria for \nthe rationale are lacking. The location of the probe tip sub-\ngingivally for a tooth depends on the pressure used, the pres-\nence of inlammation, and the angle at which the probe is \nFIG 18.9 The sulcus and epithelial attachment above the \nimplant body do not have a true connection to the implant. \n(From Misch CE: Dental implant prosthetics, ed 2, St Louis, \n2015, Mosby.)\nFIG 18.10 An implant has no connective tissue ibers in the \nconnective tissue zone that insert into the implant.

As the sulcus depth increases, the oxygen \ntension decreases. The bacteria in an implant sulcus are \nsimilar to those of a natural tooth. A toothbrush and daily \nhygiene procedures has been shown to be unable to clean a \nsulcus greater than 2 mm.50 Sulcus depths greater than 5 \nto 6 mm have a greater incidence of anaerobic bacteria \n(Table 18.5). As a consequence, this sulcus depth often \nrequires gingivectomy or bone revision surgery. As a \ngeneral rule, to enable the patient to perform effective daily \nhygiene, the ideal implant sulcus should be maintained at \nless than 5 mm.\nThe monitoring of early crestal bone loss is most impor-\ntant during the irst critical year of stress accommodation of \nthe bone. Minor bone changes are clinically easier to observe \nwith a periodontal probe than with radiographs. Early bone \nloss may occur on the facial aspect of the implant; radio-\ngraphs demonstrate clearly only the mesial and distal regions.\nChanges in crestal bone levels warrant close monitoring \nand early intervention. Patient education to reduce parafunc-\ntional stress on the implant system, the use of parafunctional \nappliances, and other stress-reducing methods is required \nwhen early crestal bone loss beyond the irst thread is detected.\nsuggest that the reproducibility of attachment level measure-\nments may be questionable independently from the instru-\nment used to perform the measurements.47,48 Many of these \nvariables are similar for a dental implant. Unlike natural \nteeth, ixed implant prostheses with subgingival margins of \ncrowns often have wide emergence proiles, making probe \npositioning dificult around most implant bodies.\nThe implant sulcus depth may be a relection of the origi-\nnal soft tissue thickness of the area before implant placement. \nThe posterior maxillary tissue can be thicker than 4 mm after \ntooth extraction and subsequent bone volume loss before \nimplant placement. As a result, the tissue above the bone \nbefore implant insertion may be 4 mm thick or more. As a \nresult of greater tissue thickness before surgery and a greater \nprobing depth compared with teeth, the probing depth next \nto a healthy implant may be greater than that of a healthy \nnatural tooth.\nWhen the tissues are thick, gingivoplasty to reduce the lap \nthickness and pocket depth can be performed at the initial \nsurgery. The advantage of the reduction in tissue thickness at \nthis time is the tissue heals and matures as the bone-implant \ninterface develops. However, thinning the lap at the initial \nsurgery may cause greater loading of the implant body during \nhealing from an overlying soft tissue–borne temporary pros-\nthesis. After initial bone healing, the stage II uncovery surgery \nalso may correct tissue thickness.\nLekholm et al found that the presence of deep pockets was \nnot accompanied by accelerated marginal bone loss.49 Stable, \nrigid, ixed implants were reported with pocket depths \nranging from 2 to 6 mm. Healthy, partially edentulous \nimplant patients consistently exhibit greater probing depths \naround implants than around teeth. An increasing probing \ndepth next to an implant is a more signiicant sign than a \nprobing depth unrelated to a time interval because it usually \nsigniies bone loss except in cases of gingival hyperplasia or \nhypertrophy.

    "content": "782\nCHAPTER 18 Periodontal and Maintenance Complications\nDespite the uncertain meaning of pocket depth increase, \nprobing is an appropriate method to assess potential deleteri-\nous changes in the periimplant environment and should be \nperformed every 3 to 4 months for 1 year after prosthesis \ndelivery. After this time, if crestal bone levels are stable, \nprobing is still relevant. Probing also reveals tissue consis-\ntency, bleeding, and exudate. Probing is important not only \nto measure increasing sulcus depths but also to allow the \ndentist to evaluate several periimplant parameters at the same \ntime and at the same sites.\nControversy exists as to the material from which the probe \nshould be fabricated. In theory, different metal types (e.g., \nstainless steel, titanium) should not come into contact because \nof a risk of contamination of the two metals and the resulting \ngalvanic corrosion that may develop and cause crestal bone \nloss. As a result of this concern, the suggestion has been made \nthat only titanium surgical instruments be used to contact \nthe implant and that only titanium or plastic instruments be \nused to probe or scale the implant (Fig. 18.11).\nTouching the surface of the abutment subgingivally with \na stainless steel instrument is not of clinical concern. However, \nscratching the surface may contribute to plaque migration \nfollowing the direction of the scratch. Plaque follows the \ndirection of scratches on a titanium plate even though right \nangles and a maze pattern may be scratched onto the surface. \nWhen probing almost to the bone level around the implant, \none should take care not to scratch the surface because plaque \nthat forms at the surface may follow the scratch subgingivally \nto the bone level. This is particularly important during scaling \nprocedures and during the removal of cement below a crown \nmargin. One should use semicircular strokes, parallel to the \nsulcus or crown margin, to scale the implant above the bone. \nIf a scratch on the implant body occurs, plaque will not have \na direct “highway” below the tissue.\nClinical Signiicance. Baseline probing depths should be \ntaken at the time of prosthesis insertion. The baseline mea-\nsurement is important because these measurements will be \nused as a reference point. The probing depths should be \nmeasured as six points (i.e., mesiobuccal, midbuccal, disto-\nbuccal, mesiopalatal, midpalatal, distopalatal). However, it \nshould be noted that implant type may complicate the \nprobing process. If the implant is platform switched (abut-\nment smaller than implant neck), probing may be dificult \nor misleading because the perio probe will not show the \ntrue extent of the pocket depth. Additionally, an overcon-\ntoured or atypical prosthesis may prevent achieving accu-\nrate probing depths.\nBLEEDING INDEX\nGingival bleeding when probing around teeth correlates with \nsulcular inlammation and plaque index. Easily ulcerated sul-\ncular epithelium represents inlammation from plaque and is \nthe primary cause of bleeding when probing. A bleeding \nindex is an indicator of sulcus health. Bleeding also can be \nprovoked by undue pressure on the probe.\nFIG 18.11 Implant probing. (A) A titanium or plastic periodon-\ntal probe to be used to evaluate pocket depth.

After 1 year of stable probing depths, the \nexamination may be restricted to facial and lingual checks at \nmaintenance appointments and may be correlated with \nradiographic observation for the mesial and distal surfaces. \nRemoval of the prosthesis for more accurate probing and \nevaluation is not indicated unless warranted by changing \nconditions. Repeated removal of a screw-retained ixed pros-\nthesis causes wear of the screw attachment system and causes \nmore frequent partially unretained restorations over the long \nterm.\nPAIN\nSubjective indings of pain, tenderness, and sensitivity are \ncommon dental conditions that the dentist treats as part of a \ngeneral practice. Pain and tenderness are subjective criteria \nand depend on the patient’s interpretation of the degree of \ndiscomfort. Pain is deined as an unpleasant sensation ranging \nfrom mild discomfort to excruciating agony. Tenderness is \nmore an unpleasant awareness of the area in question. In \ncomparison to an implant, a natural tooth often becomes \nhyperemic and sensitive to cold as the irst indicator of a \nproblem. A tooth with a more serious condition becomes \nsensitive to heat and painful to percussion, indicating pulpitis. \nDental emergencies usually are associated with pain, and the \nclinician is adept at its diagnosis and treatment planning.\nClinical Signiicance\nPain is often a poor indicator of the presence of peri-implant \ndisease, especially in the early stages. In many cases, patients \ndo not experience pain until suficient osseous destruction \nhas occurred and/or there exists an active infection with pus. \nBecause dental implants do not have PDL support and associ-\nated sensory apparatus, low-grade infections and osseous \natrophy are not detected by marginal gingiva. As the disease \nprocess begins around an implant, the patient may feel slight \ngingivitis was a precursor of progressive bone loss.51 Lekholm \net al also found that gingivitis and deep sulcular pockets were \nnot accompanied by accelerated bone loss.49 Both of these \nreports evaluated a machined-surface titanium screw design \n(e.g., Nobel Biocare).\nIn contrast to the previous reports with machined-surface \nimplants, Kirsch and Mentag found a correlation between the \ngingival sulcus depth and implant failure.52 The implant \ndesign studied in this report had an intramobile element with \na larger implant body abutment crevice and a roughened, \ntitanium plasma spray body (IMZ Maschinen Vertriebs \nGmbH). A similar correlation between implant failure and \ngingival health status was observed when a porous titanium \nalloy microball surface was exposed above the bone (Endo-\npore [Sybron Implant Solutions]).53\nIn addition to the surface condition of the implant, other \nstudies show a correlation to gingival health and implant \nteeth. Jepsen et al identiied elevated levels of proteolytic \nenzymes in an implant sulcus with inlammation and bleed-\ning on probing as predictors of implant disease.54 Lekholm \net al and Quirynen et al found that plaque and gingivitis \naround implants were correlated.55 Stelik et al found that the \ngingival bleeding index correlated highly with the plaque \nindex and the crevicular luid index.56\nClinical Signiicance\nBleeding on probing is a simple and accurate indicator of \nthe health of the peri-implant tissues. The presence or degree \nof peri-implant mucositis can be associated by the degree \nof bleeding and the possibility of progression into peri-\nimplantitis. The clinician is encouraged to probe the sulcular \nregion to evaluate crestal bone loss around the implant. Peri-\nodontal probing is less demanding than the determination of \na gingival sulcular luid volume index. One may observe the \nbleeding index while probing for sulcus depth and may record \nit easily to help evaluate gingival health.\nRegardless of whether gingival health is relative to success, \nall clinicians agree that the ideal soft tissue condition around \nan implant is an absence of inlammation. Radiographic bone \nloss and increased pocket depth have been correlated with \nsulcular bleeding. The gingival status around an implant \nshould be recorded and used to monitor the patient’s daily \noral hygiene. However, surrounding soft tissues around \nimplants have fewer blood vessels than teeth; therefore, inlam-\nmation is typically less around implants than around teeth.57\nThe most common bleeding gingival index used for \nimplants is the Loe and Silness gingival index.3 When used on \nteeth, this index scores gingival inlammation from 0 to 3 on \nthe facial, lingual, and mesial surfaces of all teeth. The symptom \nof bleeding comprises a score of at least 2 (Table 18.6).\nThe gingival index scores may also be used on implants to \nrecord the gingival inlammation on the facial, lingual, and \nmesial surfaces. The facial and lingual are already being \nprobed to evaluate bone loss that cannot be seen on a radio-\ngraph. Because the bleeding index evaluates inlammation, \nthe Loe and Silness index is adequate for implants, and \nbecause fewer implants typically are used to restore a region \nTABLE 18.6 Gingival Index \n(Loe and Silness)\nNormal\nDescription\n0\nMild inlammation, slight color change and \nedema, no bleeding\n1\nModerate inlammation, redness, edema, \nbleeds on probing\n2\nSevere inlammation, marked redness and \nedema ulceration, spontaneous bleeding\n(From Misch CE: Dental implant prosthetics, ed 2, St Louis, \n2015, Mosby.)"

This report measured bone loss from the \nirst thread as the 0-mm baseline, not from the original level \nof crestal bone at insertion, which was 1.8 mm above this \nbaseline point.15 Thus, the actual irst-year crestal bone loss \naveraged 3.3 mm around the implants observed. Years subse-\nquent to the irst showed an average of 0.05 to 0.13 mm bone \nloss per year. Other studies report an average irst-year bone \nloss of 0.93 mm, with a range from 0.4 to 1.6 mm and a mean \nloss of 0.1 mm after the irst year.58 The early crestal bone loss \nhas been observed so frequently that proposed criteria for \nsuccessful implants often do not even include the irst-year \nbone loss amount.\nThe initial transosteal bone loss around an implant forms \na V- or a U-shaped pattern, which has been described as \nditching or saucerization around the implant. The current \nhypotheses for the cause of crestal bone loss have ranged from \nrelection of the periosteum during surgery, preparation of \nthe implant osteotomy, the position of the microgap between \nthe abutment and implant body, micromovement of the \nabutment components, bacterial invasion, the establishment \nof a biologic width, and factors of stress.51,59,60,57 An under-\nstanding of the causes of marginal crestal bone loss around \ndental implants and early implant failure is critical in pre-\nventing such occurrences, fostering long-term peri-implant \nhealth, improving long-term implant success rates and, fore-\nmost, implant prosthesis success. Marginal crestal bone loss \nmay inluence esthetics because the height of the soft tissue \n(e.g., interdental papilla) is directly related to the marginal \nbone. If the tissue shrinks as a consequence of the bone loss, \nthe emergence proile of the crown elongates and the papilla \nmay disappear next to the adjacent tooth or implant. If the \nsoft tissue does not shrink, the increase in pocket depth may \nbe related to the presence of anaerobic bacteria and peri-\nimplantitis (Fig. 18.13).\nirritation, but normally not enough pain to cause alarm. It is \nrecommended that the dentist be proactive in evaluating the \nstatus of dental implants with the incorporation of a routine \nmaintenance protocol for patients.\nMARGINAL BONE LOSS\nThe marginal bone around the implant crestal region is \nusually a signiicant indicator of implant health. Unlike \nnatural teeth, the causes of crestal bone loss around the \nimplant are multifactorial and may occur at different time \nperiods. These bone loss types include surgical bone loss, \ninitial “biologic width” bone loss, early-loading bone loss, \nintermediate-term bone loss, and long-term bone loss. Each \ntime period may have a different cause for the bone loss. Most \noften the surgical trauma causes little bone loss, but on occa-\nsion, bone loss may reach several millimeters. The clinician \nmay assess the presence of surgical bone loss when a two-\nstage surgery is used to obtain initial rigid ixation. The level \nof the crestal bone is measured from the crestal position of \nthe implant at the stage II uncovery surgery. When the abut-\nment is attached to the implant body, approximately 0.5 to \n1 mm of connective tissue forms apical to this connection.55 \nThis bone loss may be caused by an “implant biologic width.” \nInitial bone loss during the surgical healing phase may vary \nfor submerged and unsubmerged healing protocols. For \nexample, an implant originally placed 2 mm above the bone \nand another countersunk 2 mm below the bone also have a \ndifferent initial bone loss history after the abutment is \nattached to the implant.42 Whenever possible, the implant \nshould be inserted at or above the bone crest to avoid an \nincrease in the sulcus depth around the implant related to the \ncrestal bone loss after abutment placement.\nAfter the implant is connected to a permucosal element, \nthe marginal bone may be lost during the irst month from \n(1) the position of the abutment-implant connection or (2) \nthe crest module design of the implant. The abutment-\nimplant connection will cause 0.5 to 1.0 mm of bone loss \nwhen it is at or below the bone. In addition, when smooth \nmetal is below the abutment-implant connection and extends \nonto the neck of the implant, additional bone loss will occur \nin direct relation to the smooth metal region. The bone levels \nwill most often recede to the irst thread or at a roughened \nsurface; after the irst month a permucosal element or abut-\nment extends through the soft tissue (Fig. 18.12).43\nCrestal bone loss has been observed around the permuco-\nsal portion of dental implants for decades. It has been \ndescribed in the crestal region of successfully osteointegrated \nimplants regardless of surgical approaches. It can range from \nloss of marginal bone to complete failure of the implant and \ndramatically decreases after the irst year.\nEarly Marginal Bone Loss\nAdell et al were the irst to quantify and report marginal \nbone loss. The study also indicated greater magnitude and \noccurrence of bone loss during the irst year of prosthesis \nloading, averaging 1.2 mm during this time frame, with a \nFIG 18.12 When an implant is placed with the abutment \nconnection at the crest of the ridge (left side), after the per-\nmucosal abutment is connected, the bone is usually lost to \nthe irst thread, especially when the crest module is machined \nor smooth (right side).

As a result, trabecular bone is readily available to \nassist in cortical blood supply and remodeling around the \nimplants. The cortical bone is remodeled to its original \ncontour, without signiicant loss of height. The periosteal \nrelection theory would lead to a generalized horizontal bone \nloss of the entire residual ridge relected, not the localized \nditching pattern around the implant that typically is observed. \nIn addition, generalized bone loss already would be directly \nnoticeable at the second-stage uncovery of the implant body, \n4 to 8 months after stage I implant placement surgery. Yet \ngeneralized bone loss rarely is observed at the second-stage \nuncovery surgery. The periosteal relection hypothesis does \nnot appear as a primary causal agent of marginal crestal bone \nloss around an implant (Fig. 18.14).\nEtiology\nThere are many theories on the potential etiologic factors that \nmay cause marginal bone loss around dental implants. These \ninclude Periosteal Relection Hypothesis, Implant Osteotomy \nHypothesis, Autoimmune Response to the Host Hypothesis, \nOcclusal Trauma, Cellular Biomechanics, Engineering Prin-\nciples, Bone Mechanical Properties, Implant Design Biome-\nchanics, and Implant Design Mechanics. Limited marginal \nbone loss during the irst year of function after stage II surgery \nhas been observed around the permucosal portion of dental \nimplants for decades. Hypotheses for the causes of crestal \nbone loss have included the relection of the periosteum \nduring surgery, preparation of the implant osteotomy, level \nof the microgap between the abutment and implant body, \nbacterial invasion, the establishment of a biologic width, the \nimplant crest module design, and occlusal overload.6,60\nPeriosteal Relection Hypothesis. Periosteal relection \ncauses a transitional change in the blood supply to the crestal \ncortical bone. Ninety percent of the arterial blood supply and \n100% of the venous return are associated with the periosteum \nin the long bones of the body.61 When the periosteum is \nrelected off the crestal bone, the cortical bone blood supply \nis affected dramatically, causing osteoblast death on the \nsurface from trauma and lack of nutrition. These events have \nfostered the periosteal relection theory as a cause for early \nbone loss around an endosteal implant.\nAlthough crestal bone cells may die from the initial trauma \nof periosteal relection, the blood supply is reestablished once \nthe periosteum regenerates. Cutting cones develop from \nmonocytes in the blood and precede new blood vessels into \nthe crestal regions of bone. Osteoblasts then are able to \nremodel the crestal bone anatomy.36 Composite bone forms \nrapidly on periosteal surfaces to restore its original condition. \nIn addition, the underlying trabecular bone is also a vascular \nsource because its blood supply often is maintained in spite \nof crestal periosteal relection. The greater the amount of \ntrabecular bone under the crestal cortical bone, the less crestal \nbone loss is observed.

If bacteria are responsible for 1.5-mm early crestal \nbone loss, what local environmental changes occur to reduce \ntheir effect by 15 times after the irst year? The bacterial auto-\nimmune theory cannot explain the marginal bone loss condi-\ntion when it follows the pattern most often reported. Although \nthe bacteria theory does not explain adequately the marginal \ncrestal bone loss phenomenon, this does not mean that bac-\nteria are not a major contributor to bone loss around an \nimplant. Threads and porous implant surfaces exposed to \nbacteria are reported to cause a more rapid loss of bone \naround an implant.66 Poor hygiene also is reported to acceler-\nate the bone loss observed around endosteal implants.67 To \nstate that bacteria are never involved in marginal bone loss \naround an implant would be incorrect. Bone loss often is \nassociated with bacteria as a causal agent. However, when \nmost bone loss occurs in the irst year and less bone loss is \nobserved afterward, the hypothesis of bacteria as the primary \ncausal agent for the early crestal bone loss cannot be \nsubstantiated.\nBiologic Width Hypothesis. The sulcular regions around \nan implant and around a tooth are similar in many respects. \nThe rete peg formation within the attached gingiva and the \nhistologic lining of the gingiva within the sulcus are similar \nin implants and teeth. A free gingival margin forms around \nan implant with nonkeratinized sulcular epithelium, and the \nepithelial cells at its base are similar to the functional epithe-\nlial cells described with natural teeth.68 However, a funda-\nmental difference characterizes the base of the gingival sulcus.\nFor a natural tooth, an average biologic width of 2.04 mm \nexists between the depth of the sulcus and the crest of the \nalveolar bone. It should be noted the biologic “width” is actu-\nally a height dimension with a greater range in the posterior \nregion compared with the anterior, and may be greater than \n4 mm in height. In teeth, it is composed of a connective tissue \n(CT) attachment (1.07 mm average) above the bone and a \njunctional epithelial attachment (0.97 mm average) at the \nsulcus base, with the most consistent value between individu-\nals being the CT attachment.39\nThe biologic width allows gingival ibers and hemi-\ndesmosomes to establish direct contact with the natural tooth \nand acts as a barrier to the bacteria in the sulcus to the under-\nlining periodontal tissues. When a crown margin invades the \nbiologic width, the crestal bone recedes to reestablish a favor-\nable environment for the gingival ibers (Fig. 18.15).69\nMany surgical protocols recommend the placement of \nendosteal implants at or below the crest of the ridge during \nthe irst-stage surgery. The abutment-to-implant body con-\nnection may be compared with a crown margin. Berglundh \net al observed 0.5 mm of bone loss below the implant-\nabutment connection within 2 weeks after stage II uncovery \nand abutment connection in dogs.26 Lindhe et al reported an \ninlammatory connective tissue extending 0.5 mm above and \nbelow this implant abutment connection.70 Wallace and \nTarnow stated that the biologic width also occurs with \nimplants and may contribute to some of the marginal bone \nImplant Osteotomy Hypothesis. Preparation of the implant \nosteotomy has been reported as a causal agent of early implant \nbone loss. Bone is a labile organ and is sensitive to heat. The \nimplant osteotomy causes trauma to the bone in immediate \ncontact with the implant, and a devitalized bone zone of \nabout 1 mm is created around the implant. A renewed blood \nsupply and cutting cones are necessary to remodel the bone \nat the interface. The crestal region is more susceptible to bone \nloss during initial repair because of its limited blood supply \nand the greater heat generated in this denser bone, especially \nwith the less eficient cutting of countersink drills used in this \nregion.62 This condition supports implant osteotomy prepa-\nration as a causal agent for marginal crestal bone loss around \nthe implant.\nHowever, if heat and trauma during implant osteotomy \npreparation were responsible for marginal crestal bone loss, \nthe effect would be noticeable at the second-stage uncovery \nsurgery 4 to 8 months later. The average bone loss of 1.5 mm \nfrom the irst thread is not observed at stage II uncovery. In \nfact, bone often has grown over the irst-stage cover screw, \nespecially when level or slightly countersunk below the bone. \nReports in the literature indicate different surgical trauma \ncauses and numbers for bone loss. For example, Manz \nobserved that bone loss at second-stage surgery ranged from \n0.89 to 0.96 mm regardless of the bone density.63 Hoar et al \nreported only 0.2-mm bone loss at stage II uncovery.64 The \nsurgical system or approach may inluence these data, but \nusually this bone loss remains minimal. One should remem-\nber that these are averages of bone loss reported. If 2 mm of \nbone loss is found on one implant and the next nine implants \nexhibit no bone loss, the average bone loss would be 0.2 mm. \nMost implants at stage II uncovery do not demonstrate any \nbone loss. The implant osteotomy hypothesis for marginal \ncrestal bone loss cannot be primarily responsible for this \nroutinely observed phenomenon.\nAutoimmune Response of Host Hypothesis. The primary \ncause of bone loss around natural teeth is bacterially induced. \nRepeat studies demonstrate that bacteria are the causative \nelement for vertical defects around teeth. Occlusal trauma \nmay accelerate the process, but trauma alone is not deemed \na determining factor.65 The implant gingival sulcus in the \npartially edentulous implant patient exhibits a bacterial lora \nsimilar to that of natural teeth. A logical assumption is that \nif implants are similar to teeth, the marginal implant bone \nloss is caused primarily by bacteria, with occlusal factors \nplaying a contributing or accelerating role.\nIn a prospective study of 125 implants, Adell et al reported \n80% of implant sulcular regions were without inlamma-\ntion.51 Lekholm et al found that deep gingival pockets around \nimplants were not associated with crestal bone loss.66 Yet the \nmarginal crestal bone loss to the irst thread of screw-type \nimplants is a common radiologic inding. If bacteria were the \ncausal agent for the initial bone loss, why does most bone loss \noccur the irst year (1.5 mm) and less (0.1 mm) each succes-\nsive year?

However, collagenous components of the linear \nbody cannot physiologically adhere to or become embedded \ninto the implant body as they do in the cementum of the \ntooth.54 The hemidesmosomal seal only has a circumferential \nband of gingival tissue to provide mechanical protection \nagainst tearing.55 The biologic seal around dental implants \ncan prevent the migration of bacteria and endotoxins into the \nunderlying bone. It is unable, however, to constitute a junc-\ntional epithelial attachment component of the biologic width \nsimilar to the one found with natural teeth. The amount of \nearly crestal bone loss seems unlikely to be solely the result \nof the remodeling of the hard and soft tissues to establish a \nbiologic width below an abutment connection. No connective \ntissue attachment zone or components of the linear body are \nembedded into an implant. The importance, amount, and \nmechanism for these anatomical structures require further \ninvestigation (Fig. 18.16).\nThe crevice between the cover screw and the implant body \nduring initial healing is similar to the crevice of the abutment-\nimplant connection. Yet bone can grow over the cover screw, \nand the crevice, in and of itself, may not be the cause of \nbone loss. The crevice between the implant and the abutment \nconnection has been called a “microgap.” The actual dimen-\nsion of this connection is usually 0 mm and has a direct \nloss observed.71 The biologic width theory seems attractive to \nexplain the lack of bone loss from the irst stage of surgery \nand the early bone loss seen within the irst year after the \nsecond-stage abutment placement. However, it should be \nnoted that the biologic “width” in implants, as reported, often \nincludes the sulcus depth, whereas the natural tooth biologic \nwidth does not include the sulcus depth. Eleven different \ngingival iber groups are observed around a natural tooth: \ndentogingival (coronal, horizontal, and apical), alveologingi-\nval, intercapillary, transgingival, circular, semicircular, dento-\nperiosteal, transseptal, periosteogingival, intercircular, and \nintergingival. At least six of these gingival iber groups insert \ninto the cementum of the natural tooth: the dentogingival \n(coronal, horizontal, and apical), dentoperiosteal, transseptal, \ncircular, semicircular, and transgingival ibers. In addition, \nsome crestal ibers from the periodontal iber bundles also \ninsert into the cementum above the alveolar bone.3 However, \nin a typical implant gingival region, only two of these gingival \niber groups and no periodontal ibers are present. These \nibers do not insert into the implant body below the abut-\nment margin as they do into the cementum of natural teeth.72 \nInstead, the collagen ibers in the CT attachment around an \nimplant run parallel to the implant surface, not perpendicu-\nlar, as with natural teeth.73 The gingival and periosteal iber \ngroups are responsible for the connective tissue attachment \ncomponent of the biologic width around teeth, and these are \nnot present around the transosteal region of an implant.

Bone remodeling at the cellular \nlevel is controlled by the mechanical environment of strain.82 \nStrain is deined as the change in length divided by the origi-\nnal length, and the units of strain are given in percentages. \nThe amount of strain in a material is directly related to the \namount of stress applied.10 Occlusal stress applied through \nthe implant prosthesis and components can transmit stress \nto the bone-implant interface. The amount of bone strain at \nthe bone-implant interface is directly related to the amount \nof stress applied through the implant prosthesis. Mechano-\nsensors in bone respond to minimal amounts of strain, and \nmicrostrain levels 100 times less than the ultimate strength \nof bone may trigger bone remodeling (Fig. 18.17).83\nOne of the earliest remodeling theories for a direct rela-\ntionship between stress and the magnitude of bone remodel-\ning was proposed by Kummer in 1972.84 More recently, Frost \nreported on the cellular reaction of bone to different \nmicrostrain levels.85 He observed that bone fractures at 10,000 \nto 20,000 microstrain units (1% to 2% deformation). \nHowever, at levels 20% to 40% of this value (4000 units), \nbone cells may trigger cytokines to begin a resorption \nresponse. In other words, excessive bone strain may not only \nresult in physical fracture but may also cause bone cellular \nresorption. The hypothesis that occlusal stresses beyond the \nphysiologic limits of bone may result in strain in the bone \nsigniicant enough to cause bone resorption is plausible from \na cellular biomechanics standpoint. To date, bone cellular \nstudies have not replicated this bone condition next to a \ndental implant. However, cytokines in the bone-implant \ninterface tissue obtained from failed hip replacement devices \nleading to bone loss have been reported in humans.86\nEngineering principles. The relationship between stress \nand strain determines the modulus of elasticity (stiffness) of \na material. The modulus conveys the amount of dimensional \nchange in a material for a given stress level. The modulus of \nelasticity of a tooth is similar to that of cortical bone. Dental \nimplants are typically fabricated from titanium or its alloy. \nThe modulus of elasticity of titanium is 5 to 10 times greater \nthan that of cortical bone (Fig. 18.18). An engineering prin-\nciple called the composite beam analysis states that when two \nmaterials of different elastic moduli are placed together with \nno intervening material and one is loaded, a stress contour \nincrease will be observed where the two materials irst come \ninto contact.87 In an implant-bone interface, these stress \nmetal-to-metal connection. However, when the crevice is \nexposed to the oral environment, bone loss is usually observed \nfor at least 0.5 mm below the connection.74 The biologic \nwidth hypothesis cannot fully explain the several millimeters \nof marginal crestal bone loss, which also has been observed \nreadily with one-stage implants that extend through the \ntissue at the initial implant placement surgery and have no \nabutment-implant connections. For example, plate form \n(blade) implants, transosteal implants, pins, one-piece screw \nimplants, and even subperiosteal implants demonstrate the \nmarginal crestal bone loss phenomenon.\nIt is true that bone loss does occur around an exposed \nabutment-implant connection placed below the bone \n(observed within 2 to 4 weeks) once the connection is exposed \nto the oral environment. The bone loss often occurs before \nthe implant is loaded with the prosthesis. It is logical to call \nthis marginal bone loss the biologic width. The primary ques-\ntion remains, when the surgeon places the implant abutment \nconnection below the bone, how much bone loss is from the \nimplant biologic width and out of the inluence of the dental \npractitioner? Several reports in the literature note implant \nmacro- and microgeometry may affect the biologic width \ndimensions or the amount of early crestal bone loss.75\nThe bone loss to the irst thread observation implies the \namount of bone loss is similar for different implant designs. \nHowever, the irst thread is a different distance from the abut-\nment margin for several implant designs. A smooth polished \n4-mm collar below the bone has been associated with greater \nbone loss than a smooth 2-mm collar below the bone. The \nimplant biologic width concept does not explain completely \nthe total amount of vertical bone loss observed. In addition, \nthe amount of bone loss from the biologic width occurs \nwithin 1 month whether the implant is loaded or not and is \nrelated to the crest module implant design and the position \nof the abutment-implant connection in relation to the bone \nbut is unrelated to the density of the bone. The concept does \nnot explain why greater crestal bone loss often is observed in \nsoft bone compared with denser bone after loading, nor does \nit explain the higher implant failure rates in lesser-quality \nbone after loading.\nOcclusal Trauma. Marginal bone loss on an implant may \nbe from occlusal trauma.60 Occlusal trauma may be deined \nas an injury to the attachment apparatus as a result of exces-\nsive occlusal force. A controversy exists as to the role of occlu-\nsion in the bone loss observed after an implant prosthesis \ndelivery. Some articles state that peri-implant bone loss \nwithout implant failure is primarily associated with biologic \nformations or complications.76 Other authors suggest a cor-\nrelation of crestal bone loss to occlusal overload.57,77 The \ndetermination of the etiology of bone loss around dental \nimplants is needed in order to minimize its occurrence and \nfoster long-term peri-implant health that may ultimately \ndetermine implant prosthesis survival.\nThe association of occlusal trauma and bone loss around \nnatural teeth has been debated since Karolyi claimed a rela-\ntionship in 1901.78 A number of authors conclude trauma"

The crestal bone levels for 100 mm and control \nimplants with no loading were similar. However, statistically \nsigniicant crestal bone loss was observed in the 180-mm \ngroup. The 250-mm group experienced two to three times \nthe bone loss of the crowns with moderate prematurities. \nDuyck used a dog model to evaluate the crestal bone loss \naround screw-type dental implants with no loads (controls), \nstatic loads, and dynamic loads.92 The dynamic-loaded \nimplants were the only group to demonstrate crestal bone \nloss. Because the only variable in these two studies was the \nintensity or type of occlusal load applied to the implants, \nthese animal reports imply dynamic occlusal loading may be \na factor in crestal bone loss around rigid ixated dental \nimplants.\nClinical reports have shown an increase in marginal bone \nloss around implants closest to a cantilever used to restore the \nlost dentition.93 Cantilever length and an increase in occlusal \nstress to the nearest abutment are directly related and point \nto the fact that the increase in marginal bone loss may be \nrelated to occlusal stress. Quirynen et al evaluated 93 implant \npatients with various implant restorations and concluded \nthat the amount of crestal bone loss was deinitely associated \nwith occlusal loading.58 These authors also reported increased \ncrestal bone loss around implants in patients with no anterior \nocclusal contacts and parafunctional habits in full-arch ixed \nprostheses in both jaws. These clinical reports do not provide \nstatistical analyses to demonstrate a clear link between occlu-\nsal stress and bone loss. However, they indicate a consensus \nby some authors that occlusal overload may be related to the \nincidence of peri-implant bone loss around the cervical \naspect of an implant. In fact, in a study of 589 consecutive \nimplants, Naert et al suggested overload from parafunctional \nhabits may be the most probable cause of implant loss and \nmarginal bone loss after loading.94\nRangert et al have noted that occlusal loads on an implant \nmay act as a bending moment, which increases stress at the \nmarginal bone level and can cause implant body fracture.95 \nBefore the fracture of the implant body, marginal bone loss \nwas noted in this retrospective clinical evaluation. The same \nstress that caused implant fracture is the logical cause of the \nperi-implant bone loss before the event. Rosenberg et al \nfound microbial differences in implant failures from both \noverload and biologic complications.96 Uribe et al presented \nthe case of a mandibular implant crown with a marginal peri-\nimplantitis and osseous defect.97 Histologic analysis revealed \nan iniltrate and a central zone of dense ibroconnective tissue \nwith scanty inlammatory cells. According to the authors, this \ninding differs from chronic inlammatory tissue associated \nwith infectious peri-implantitis and can be directly related to \nocclusal overload. A clinical report by Leung et al observed \nradiographic angular crestal bone loss to the seventh thread \naround one of two implants supporting a ixed prosthesis in \nobserved the amount of marginal bone loss next to an implant \nwas related to the density of bone.63 The initial peri-implant \nbone loss from implant insertion to uncovery was similar for \nall bone qualities. However, 6 months after prosthesis deliv-\nery, the additional radiographic-observed peri-implant bone \nloss ranged from 0.68 mm for quality 1 to 1.1 mm for quality \n2, 1.24 mm for quality 3, and 1.44 mm for quality 4-type \nbone (Fig. 18.20). In other words, the more dense the bone, \nthe less peri-implant bone loss was observed after prosthesis \ndelivery. A clinical report by Appleton et al89 demonstrated \nthat progressively loaded single-tooth implants in the irst \npremolar region of human beings exhibited greater bone \ndensity increase in the crestal half of the implant interface \nand less marginal bone loss compared with nonprogressively \nloaded implants in the same jaw region and even the same \npatient on the contralateral side without progressive loading. \nBecause an increase in bone density is related to bone strength, \nelastic modulus, bone remodeling, and a decrease in marginal \nbone loss, these entities may be related to each other.\nSeveral animal studies in the literature demonstrate the \nability of bone tissue to respond to a dental implant. For \nexample, Hoshaw et al inserted dental implants into a dog \nfemur perpendicular to the axis of the long bone and perpen-\ndicular to the direction of the osteons.90 After applying a \ntensile load to the implants for only 5 days, the bone cells \nreorganized to follow the implant thread pattern and resist \nthe load. This unique bone pattern was observed for only 3 \nto 4 mm around the implants. Crestal bone loss was also \nnoted around these implants and explained as stress overload. \nTo rearrange its osteal structure, bone must remodel.\nFIG 18.20 Mean peri-implant vertical bone change for study \nintervals by bone quality score. Many observed the amount of \nbone loss from stage 1 to stage 2 was similar, regardless of \nbone quality. However, after 6 months of loading, the amount \nof marginal bone loss was directly related to the quality of the \nbone, with type 4 (the softest bone) exhibiting the greatest \nbone loss.

Lamellar \nbone develops several months after the woven bone repair \nhas replaced the devitalized bone caused by the surgical \ninsertion trauma around the implant.101 The occlusal stress \nlevels may be high enough to cause woven bone microfrac-\nture or overload during the irst year, but the increase in \nbone strength achieved after complete mineralization and \norganization may be able to resist the same stress levels \nduring the subsequent years.\nAs functional forces are placed on an implant, the sur-\nrounding bone can adapt to the stresses and increase its \ndensity, especially in the crestal half of the implant body \nduring the irst 6 months to 1 year of loading.102 In a histologic \nand histomorphometric study of bone, Piatelli et al reported \nreactions to unloaded and loaded nonsubmerged implants in \nmonkeys (Figs. 18.21 and 18.22). The bone changed from a \nine trabecular pattern after initial healing to a more dense \nand coarse trabecular pattern after loading, especially in the \ncrestal half of the implant interface.103 Hoshaw loaded \nthreaded implants in dogs with a tensile load and noted that \nthe ine trabecular bone pattern became coarse trabecular \nbone around the implant.90 In addition, the bone reorganized \nto a more favorable condition to assist the direction and type \nof occlusal load (Fig. 18.23). Fine trabecular bone is less dense \nthan coarse trabecular bone. Because the density of bone is \ndirectly related to its strength and elastic modulus, the crestal \nbone strength and biomechanical mismatch between tita-\nnium and bone may diminish gradually during the functional \nloading phase. In other words, the stresses applied to the peri-\nimplant bone may be great enough to cause bone resorption \nduring the irst year because bone strains are greatest at the \ncrest. However, the stresses applied below the crest of bone \nare of less magnitude and may correspond to the physiologic \nstrain that allows the bone to gain density and strength. As a \nresult, the occlusal load that causes bone loss initially (over-\nload) is not great enough to cause continued bone loss once \nthe bone matures and becomes more dense.\nA clinical report by Appleton et al demonstrated that pro-\ngressively loaded single-tooth implants in the irst premolar \nregion of humans exhibited less bone loss and greater bone \ndensity increase in the crestal half of the implant interface \ncompared with nonprogressively loaded implants in the same \njaw region, and even in the same patient, on the contralateral \nside.104 (Fig. 18.24). Marginal bone loss is less in the mandible \ncompared with the maxilla in several clinical reports. The \nbone is denser in the mandible than the maxilla. The reduced \ncrestal bone loss that has been reported in the mandible in \ngreater bone densities and in progressively loaded implants \npoint to the fact that stress/strain is a primary etiology of \ncrestal bone loss after the implant is loaded. The stresses at \nthe crest of the ridge may cause microfracture or overload \nduring the irst year, and the change in bone strength after \nloading and mineralization is complete alters the stress/strain \nrelationship and reduces the risk of microfracture during the \nfollowing years.105\nImplant design biomechanics. Different amounts of \nmarginal bone loss have been reported for different implant \nhyperocclusion 2 weeks after prosthesis delivery.98 The pros-\nthesis was removed, and over the next few months radio-\ngraphic observation showed the crestal defect was repaired to \nalmost the initial level, without any surgical or drug interven-\ntion. The prosthesis was then seated with proper occlusal \nadjustment. The bone levels stabilized at the second thread \nof the implant and remained stable over the next 36 months. \nThis report indicates bone loss from occlusal overload is not \nonly possible but may even be reversible when found early in \nthe process. Although no prospective clinical study to date \nhas clearly demonstrated a direct relationship between stress \nand bone loss without implant failure, several practitioners \nagree a causal relationship may exist.\nThe fact that occlusal overload may be an etiology for \ncrestal bone loss does not mean other factors are not present. \nFor example, the microgap position of the implant platform \nand abutment and the biologic width often affect the mar-\nginal bone during the irst month after the implant becomes \npermucosal. However, the clinician has certain variables \nunder their control that may inluence the amount of peri-\nimplant bone loss. The position of the microgap in relation \nto the bony crest and the implant crest module design are \nprimarily under the control of the implant surgeon. On \nthe other hand, the autoimmune or bacterial response of the \npatient, the biologic width, and the patient response to the \nsurgical trauma of implant placement are variables often \nescaping the control of the dentist. Once the inal prosthesis \nis delivered to the patient, many events responsible for mar-\nginal bone loss have already occurred, whereas others such as \nocclusal overload and its relationship to the quality of bone \npersist. Occlusal overload is one factor most in control of the \nrestoring dentist. If a relationship between occlusal overload \nand crestal bone loss exists, approaches to decrease stress to \nan implant interface appear appropriate. A puzzling element \nin the relationship between occlusal force and peri-implant \nbone loss is the lack of continued bone loss until the implant \nfails. Implant crown height may be measured from the \nocclusal plane to the crest of the bone. The crown height is a \nvertical cantilever, which may magnify the stresses applied to \nthe prosthesis. As a result of the greater crown height from \nthe vertical bone loss, occlusal overload will be increased \nafter crestal bone loss occurs. If occlusal loading forces can \ncause crestal bone loss, the resulting increased moment \nforces should further promote the loss of bone until the \nimplant fails. Yet most clinical studies indicate the rate of \nbone loss decreases after the irst year of loading and is \nminimal thereafter. There are two reasons why the bone \nlevels may become stable after initial marginal bone loss, \neven when the cause is from occlusal overload: bone physiol-\nogy and implant design mechanics.\nBone physiology. The bone is less dense and weaker at \nstage 2 implant surgery than it is 1 year later after prosthetic \nloading.99 Bone is 60% mineralized at 4 months and takes 52 \nweeks to complete its mineralization.100 Partially mineralized \nbone is weaker than fully mineralized bone. In addition, the \nmicroscopic organization of bone progresses during the irst \nyear. Woven bone is unorganized and weaker than lamellar"

There were no clinical indings of inlammation \nor exudate. The range of bone loss with the different implant \nsurface conditions and designs in a clinical report suggests \nthat more than the biologic width, microgap position, and/\nor surgical causes are involved in the individual implant mar-\nginal bone loss process. The three most probable factors that \ninluenced the amount of crestal bone loss in this report are \nthe amount of force applied to the prosthesis, the quality of \nthe bone to resist these forces, and the implant body design. \nAll three of these conditions implicate occlusal overload as \nthe cause of marginal bone loss around an implant.\nA prospective study by Karousis et al also indicated that \ndifferent implant designs and surface conditions correspond \nto different incidences of crestal bone loss.107 Three different \nimplant designs from the same manufacturer were evaluated \nover 10 years in a prospective report. One implant body \ndesign lost more than 5 mm of bone 26% of the time, whereas \nthe other two designs reported 37% and 39% incidence. More \nthan 6 mm of marginal bone loss occurred in 22% of the \nimplants with the irst design, compared with 35% and 33% \nfor the other two designs. These results indicate that one \nimplant design may result in less marginal bone loss than \nanother and point to the fact that clinical reports with similar \nhealing and loading protocols, but of variable implant body \ndesigns and surface conditions, may yield different amounts \nof crestal bone loss. Because the implant design and surface \ncondition affect the amount of stress transferred to the bone, \none of the reasons for a different amount of bone loss for \ndifferent implant designs may be related to the stress trans-\nmitted to the bone.\nIn the ield of orthopedics, hip joint replacement has \nseveral complications, including wound infection, peripros-\nthetic fracture, dislocation, mechanical failure, and osteoly-\nsis.108 Osteolysis refers to the bone resorption that occurs \naround both cemented and uncemented orthopedic implants. \nFIG 18.24 Researchers observed in humans that less crestal \nbone loss and an increase in bone density were present \naround implants progressively loaded in the maxillary irst \npremolar region.

Mechanical loading factors primarily are \nassociated with this condition. Patient factors that increase \nloading failure include body weight and activity level. An \nanimal model and human report have linked the resorption \nof bone at the interface to mechanical overload.109 Treatment \nof the disorder, if the patient is asymptomatic with a large \nosteolytic defect but no implant mobility, includes curettage \nof the osteolytic membrane and bone grafting.110 These \northopedic reports accept that mechanical overload can cause \nbone resorption at the bone-implant interface. The metal \nmost often used in hip replacement therapy is titanium alloy, \nand the bone-implant interface is very similar to a dental \nimplant. In addition, potential causative elements encoun-\ntered intraorally, such as oral bacteria contamination, micro-\ngap position, and microbial-related bone loss, are eliminated \nin this aseptic environment. It is logical to assume these \nstudies further support a relationship between marginal bone \nloss around implants and biomechanical stress.\nRadiographic Evaluation of Bone Loss. The radiographic \nassessment of natural teeth assists in determining the pres-\nence of decay, lesions of endodontic origin, and periodontal \nbone loss. Radiographs may be used to evaluate the result of \nperiodontal diseases on the supporting bone but cannot indi-\ncate the presence or absence of the disease process. Assess-\nments of bone loss for natural teeth may include (1) the \npresence or absence of intact lamina dura; (2) the width of \nthe PDL space; (3) the bone crest morphology (even or \nangular); and (4) the distance from the cementoenamel junc-\ntion (CEJ) and the coronal level of the PDL (normal or \nabnormal width). Normal radiographic bone levels next to \nnatural teeth are typically between 1 to 3 mm from the CEJ.\nImplants do not decay and do not develop endodontic-\nrelated conditions. However, the crestal bone region is often \nthe most diagnostic for the ranges of optimum, satisfactory, \nand compromised health conditions. Radiographic interpre-\ntation is one of the easiest clinical tools to use to assess \nimplant crestal bone loss but has many limitations. A radio-\ngraph only illustrates clearly the mesial and distal crestal \nlevels of bone. However, early bone loss often occurs on the \nfacial aspect of the implant.\nAn absence of radiolucency around an implant does not \nmean bone is present at the interface, especially in the ante-\nrior mandible. As much as 40% decrease in density is neces-\nsary to produce a traditional radiographic difference in this \nregion because of the dense cortical bone.111 When the bone \nis wide, a V-shaped crestal defect around an implant may be \nsurrounded by cortical bone and, as a result, the radiograph \nis less diagnostic.\nParallel periapical radiographs are more dificult to obtain \nfor implants than for teeth. An implant is often apical to the \napex of the preexisting natural tooth. As a result, the apex of \nthe implant often is located beyond muscle attachments or in \nregions almost impossible to capture with a parallel radio-\ngraphic method. A foreshortened image to accommodate the \nFIG 18.27 Vertical bitewings are often more diagnostic to deter-\nmine radiographic bone loss compared with radiographs, which \nattempt to capture the apex of the implant.

The implant quality of health eval-\nuation protocol depends on clinical and radiographic obser-\nvations. A baseline radiograph is obtained at the initial \ndelivery of the prosthesis. By this time the “biologic width” \nand inluence of the implant crest module design have already \ncontributed to its inluence on crestal bone loss.

Vertical bitewing radiographs may \nbe taken at 1 year and compared with the previous two \nimages. If no changes are apparent, subsequent radiographic \nexaminations may be scheduled for every 3 years unless other \nclinical signs warrant more frequent examinations.\nIf crestal changes are evident by probing or radiographs, \nstress reduction and hygiene are modiied accordingly. Radio-\ngraphs are taken and reviewed every 6 to 8 months until the \nbone is stable for two consecutive periods. If bone loss greater \nthan 2 mm is observed from the bone levels noted at the \nprosthesis delivery, the dentist should strongly suspect para-\nfunction on too few implants. Night guards and stress reduc-\ntion on the affected implants are indicated.\nPERI-IMPLANT DISEASE\nThe following section outlines the major types of peri-\nimplant disease, while offering a comprehensive treatment \nand prevention protocol (Table 18.7).\nPeri-implant Mucositis\nPeri-implant mucositis is an inlammatory condition of the \nsoft tissue surrounding an implant, which is similar to gingi-\nvitis around a tooth.

For the removal \nof the supra- and subgingival bioilm and bacteria, debride-\nment of the exposed implant surface and implant abutment \nmust be completed. There exist many different debridement \nsystems.\nCurettes. The selection of scalers for titanium implant \ndebridement is important to minimize surface changes fol-\nlowing treatment. There are various types of curettes avail-\nable for debridement procedures.\n• Titanium-coated curettes are speciically made for \ndental implant debridement because they have a similar \nhardness to the titanium surface and will not scratch or \nmar the surface.\n• Carbon-iber curettes are softer than the implant sur-\nfaces and will not damage the implant surface. These \ntypes of curettes are prone to fracture.\n• Telon curettes are similar to carbon-reinforced curettes \nand will not scratch the surface of the implant.\n• Plastic curettes have been advocated as the instrument \nof choice to prevent damage from the implant surface. \nHowever, the eficacy and eficiency of these instru-\nments are questionable. These types of curettes are also \nprone to breaking.\n• Stainless steel curettes are much harder than titanium \nalloy and are not recommended for use around dental \nimplants because they may alter the implant surface.\n• Amorphous resin scalers come with unilled or illed \nresin. Unilled resin scalers have no reinforcements for \nshape or stiffness while illed resin illers may use mate-\nrials like silica, graphite, or glass. These scalers have \nreplacement tips on a stainless steel handle. Longevity \nof these curettes tends to be relatively short.\n• Titanium brush burs (Salvin) insert into implant motor. \nThey have a variety of shapes allowing them to adapt \naround implant surface circumferentially, single surface, \nand groove cleaning. Brushes are used at 600 rpm and \nadapted against implant surface to remove debris.\nHasturk et al compared six different types of scaler mate-\nrials and their tendency to scratch surfaces of different brands \nof implants abutments under scanning electron microscope. \nThe result showed glass-illed resin curettes caused the most \nscratches while the unilled resin scalers had the least surface \nalteration. However, these studies are on smooth titanium \nabutments and not on the rough implant surface.120 A study \nby Anastassiadis suggested that there may not be any clinical \nrelevance on whether curettes scratch implant surfaces or not. \nIt has been previously demonstrated that metal scalers do not \nreadily scratch cementum; it is questionable that a titanium \nimplant surface, which has a higher Mohs hardness, should \nbe of any concern.121 Furthermore, scalers as a whole may be \neffective in removing large calculus particles or granulation \ntissues but are rather ineffective trying to navigate the perim-\neter and grooves of an exposed implant surface. For that \nreason, curette material may not be a signiicant concern, but \nrather the act of curetting is (Fig. 18.30).\nUltrasonic devices. Ultrasonic devices with special \npolyetheretherketone-coated tips have been used to debride \nnumerous studies.112,113 Histologically, peri-implant mucosi-\ntis is composed of T cells with an apical extension that is \nlimited to the barrier epithelium.114 Most cases of peri-\nmucositis are due to poor oral hygiene, inability to clean the \nimplant or prosthesis, poor implant position, poor it of the \nprosthesis, and retained cement.\nAdditionally, peri-mucositis may also be caused by tita-\nnium alloy hypersensitivity. Most dental implants today are \ncovered by a titanium dioxide layer that gives the implant a \nhigh surface energy that facilitates the interaction between \nthe host tissues and the dental implant. When the implant \nbecomes exposed to the oral environment, a lower surface \nenergy may provoke a type IV hypersensitivity reaction that \nmay contribute to peri-mucositis.115\nPrevention. Because of the high prevalence of peri-mucositis, \nit is imperative the implant clinician be able to assess the risk \nproile of each patient and take this into consideration when \ntreatment planning is initiated. A recent consensus report by the \nAmerican Academy of Periodontology has shown risk factors to \ninclude poor oral hygiene, history of periodontal disease, \nsmoking, retained cement, and occlusal disharmonies. Systemic \nfactors also have been shown to include such disorders as dia-\nbetes and cardiovascular disease.116 The clinician should be well \nversed on the role of systemic diseases and medications have on \nthe soft tissue interface that may result in peri-mucositis.\nAnother key component of peri-mucositis prevention is \nideal implant placement. The implant should be placed in \nthe ideal buccal-lingual, mesial-distal, and apical-coronal \ndimension to ensure soft tissue health. This will also allow for \nideal prosthesis design, which will facilitate ideal hygiene \nprocedures.\nManagement. Peri-implant mucositis has been shown to be \na reversible inlammatory process.8 However, if not treated \nproperly, the persistent inlammatory condition may progress \nto peri-implantitis that includes irreversible bone loss. In \nmost cases, peri-mucositis is required for the development of \nperi-implantitis.117,118\nNonsurgical mechanical debridement coupled with anti-\nmicrobial rinse therapies is the primary therapeutic approach \nfor peri-implant mucositis. Factors contributing to poor \nmanagement of peri-implant mucositis may include lack of \npatient compliance, inconsistent maintenance intervals, and \nimpairment of implant prosthesis for proper plaque control.119\nBecause peri-implantitis is reversible, it is imperative the \nbioilm be eliminated from the implant surface. If the bioilm \nremains, peri-mucositis may progress to peri-implantitis.\nThe goal of peri-implant mucositis treatment is to rees-\ntablish a healthy peri-implant mucosa by means of removing \nthe peri-implant bioilm and calculus without damaging or \naltering the implant surface.\nIt is crucial to implement a comprehensive patient and \nprofessional oral hygiene program to combat the peri-implant \nmucositis. Power brushes, interproximal and irrigation power \ndevices, dentifrices, and antimicrobials have been recom-\nmended in the management of peri-implant mucositis."

Bürgers et al studied \nseveral of the antiseptics and their effectiveness on S. epider-\nmis, C. albicans, and S. sanguinis. While sodium hypochlorite \nwas most effective in the reduction of all three bacterial bio-\nilms, it has the highest tissue toxicity. Hydrogen peroxide was \nonly active against C. albicans, while chlorhexidine gluconate, \nphenols, and essential oils only had activity against S. sangui-\nnis and C. albicans.125\nNot enough supportive studies have deemed any of the \nlisted antiseptics as the clear choice, but 40% citric acid is \nrecommended for ease of use, tissue compatibility, and effec-\ntiveness in reducing bacterial residue (Fig. 18.31).126\nLocally delivered antibiotics. The recommended locally \ndelivered antibiotic (LDA) is tetracycline at 50 mg/ml solu-\ntion. Tetracycline capsules can be opened and mixed with \nsmall amounts of saline solution to create a paste. This paste \nthe implant surface. This tip is made of a plastic material with \na stainless steel core. This ultrasonic device allows the debride-\nment of plaque and calculus while leaving a smooth and clean \nsurface.\nWhile metal tips are not recommended, plastic tips may \nhave high chances of shredding when cleaning around \nimplant grooves and threads. Tips made of PEEK material by \nHu-Friedy have been shown to be resistant to shredding and \nmay be considered.\nNeither the American Dental Association nor American \nAcademy of Periodontology have released a consensus on the \nuse of ultrasonic devices around implants. Evidence is cur-\nrently anecdotal and not suficient to support use of devices.\nAntimicrobials. Antiseptics are deined as antimicrobial \nsubstances that are nondamaging to living tissue/skin while \nreducing the possibility of infection, sepsis, or putrefaction. \nThere are several types of antiseptics ready for dental \nuse: sodium hypochlorite 1.0%, hydrogen peroxide 3.0%, \nchlorhexidine gluconate 0.12% (USA) or 0.2% (Europe, Asia, \nCanada), citric acid 40.0%, EDTA 24%, povidone iodine \n10%, phenols and essential oils. In regards to peri-implantitis, \nseveral qualities are needed for antiseptics to be effective: \nbioilm penetration, long substantivity, tissue biocompatibil-\nity, and low resistance. For these reasons, we recommend the \nuse of citric acid. Removal of macro deposits should be per-\nformed with scalers irst. A cotton pellet is soaked with 40% \ncitric acid. It is gently dabbed to remove excess luid then \nburnished onto exposed implant surfaces for 30 to 60 \nseconds.122 Although there are many other potential antisep-\ntics such as povidone iodine, hydrogen peroxide, chlorhexi-\ndine, and saline, citric acid has the most biocompatible \ncharacteristics and ease of use. Citric acid is shown to be able \nto reduce bacterial endotoxin, speciically Porphyromonas \ngingivalis, by up to 90% with 2 minutes of contact.123 The \nbody is capable of handling minimal amount of bacterial \ncolonies. With mechanical and antiseptic use, it allows cells a \nchance to try to regenerate onto clean implant surfaces.\nIn regards to other antiseptics, chlorhexidine applied on a \ncotton pellet and burnished against machined surface has \nshown a 92.9% Pg endotoxin reduction but is known to be \nFIG 18.30 (A) Titanium curette.

The mechani-\ncal reduction of supragingival plaque by removal with tooth-\nbrushes (manual or powered) signiicantly reduces the \namount and composition of subgingival microbiota around \nteeth. This reduction should translate to a decreased risk \nof periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. Furthermore, \nthe decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supra-\ngingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species \n(Fig. 18.33).131\nThe absence of adequate keratinized mucosa in endosse-\nous dental implants, especially in posterior implants, was \nassociated with higher plaque accumulation and gingival \ninlammation but not with more annual bone loss, regardless \nof the implant’s surface conigurations.132 The implant type, \nwith the presence or absence of keratinized tissue, may be a \nchallenge for oral hygiene procedures for many patients. The \nclinician should stress the importance of adequately perform-\ning plaque control and select products and procedures that \nare well suited to the needs and ability of the patient.\nToothbrushing: Manual and Power. There are many types \nof toothbrushes available for implant patients to clean \nexposed implant surfaces and prostheses. The patient should \nbe instructed to initially attempt to use a soft, multitufted, \nnylon toothbrush. Because of often nonideal implant loca-\ntions or prostheses, the clinician should choose a handle \nthat will allow for easy access to all areas. The toothbrush \ntechnique should be the modiied Bass technique or a short, \nhorizontal back-and-forth movement can be utilized. The \nmodiied Bass technique allows for the brush to be held at a \n45-degree angle where the abutment post meets the gingival \ntissue. A location that is often missed is lingual aspect of the \nabutments or prosthesis.\nIn some instances, patients will be able to use rotary \nunitufted power brushes, oscillating-rotating brushes, and \nsonic brushes. Most available powered brushes will not \ndamage the exposed implant surfaces or abutments. Most \nmanufactured power brushes have soft interchangeable \nis burnished onto implant surfaces for 60 seconds then thor-\noughly rinsed away with saline. Tetracycline is bacteriostatic \nbecause it targets the 30s ribosomal subunit in the mRNA \ntranslation complex of bacterial protein synthesis. It is also \nfound to have inhibition effect on matrix metalloproteinases; \nthe application of tetracycline solution needs to be completely \nremoved. A study with pure tetracycline application showed \nreosseointegration after 4 months.127 It is highly recommended \nto incorporate tetracycline in treatment of peri-implantitis.\nClinical signiﬁcance. Tetracycline capsules may be mixed \nwith few drops of saline to form a slime gel consistency. It \nshould stay gelled when scooped up to be delivered to exposed \nimplant surfaces. The gel is allowed to sit on implant surface \nfor 1 to 5 minutes then thoroughly rinsed off. It allows proxi-\nmal contact of antibiotics to implant surface colonies and may \nassist in success in treatment of peri-implantitis (Fig. 18.32).\nSystemic antibiotics. The use of systemic antibiotics has \nbeen well studied for treatment of periodontitis.128 However, \nperi-implantitis treatments with use of systemic antibiotics \nare relatively few. It is known that patients with periodontitis \nare three times more likely to develop peri-implantitis, but \nthe bacterial colonies found in peri-implantitis and peri-\nodontitis share few characteristics. Still, many studies have \ndemonstrated the most effective combination as amoxicillin \nand metronidazole. Metronidazole is bactericidal to anaero-\nbic organisms. It disrupts DNA synthesis. This antibiotic has \nbeen shown to be especially effective against A. actinomy-\ncetemcomitans and effective against P. gingivalis and P. inter-\nmedia.129 The amoxicillin and metronidazole combination \nhas also been shown to have long-term effects against A. \nactinomycetemcomitans.130 Use of amoxicillin and metronida-\nzole mixture is recommended.

In some cases, interproximal brushes with small \nbrush heads (e.g., GUM End Tuft [Sunstar Americas, Inc.]) \nmay be required for easier access. However, caution should \nbe exercised to use plastic-coated devices because metal may \npotentially damage or scar the implant or prosthesis surface.\nThere are numerous types of loss on the market for \nimplant hygiene use. A commonly used brand is Oral-B \nSuper Floss, which is a thicker, wide ribbon that has one end \nthat allows for ease of threading.

In addition, several other factors exist, such as poor \nimplant placement, poor oral hygiene, residual cement, the \nbody’s rejection, poor implant surface, unfavorable osseous \ndensity, untreated periodontitis, drinking and smoking, \nuntreated endodontic lesions, diabetes, etc. More etiologies \nare being identiied as studies continue. Unfavorable stress \nfactors can initiate crestal bone loss, and bacterial presence \ncan further propagate the rate of osseous destruction. In \nrecent studies, Rodrigues et al found that bacterial bioilms \nattached onto the surface of implants can create a highly \nacidic environment that causes corrosion, pitting, cracking, \netc.135 Furthermore, new studies have shed light on the release \nof titanium ions from the implant surface, which causes a \nsigniicant increase in local inlammatory effect.136\nPrevention\nHome care. An effective oral hygiene program is para-\nmount to minimize peri-implant disease. This has been shown \nthrough multiple studies. Lindquist found a direct association \nbetween poor oral hygiene and peri-implant bone loss in a \n10-year follow-up study.137 Other studies have shown a cor-\nrelation with poor oral hygiene and a higher plaque score.138 \nAdditionally, patients who have lost their teeth to periodontal \ndisease are more susceptible to peri-implantitis.139\nProfessional care. A thorough periodontal charting and \nreview is essential. Patients with periodontitis need to have this \ncondition controlled before implant placement. Patients who \ndo not demonstrate the ability to maintain oral hygiene need \nto be educated and put on a stringent professional care regimen.\nProsthetic design. A thoroughly evaluated cone beam \ncomputed tomography (CBCT) scan with favorable biome-\nchanical design for prosthetics is required. Refer to Misch’s \nbook, Dental Implant Prosthetics, ed 2, for detailed treatment \ndesigns and recommendations in treatment cases.\nCementation technique. The meticulous use of cements \nwhen delivering a prosthesis is imperative, or the clinician can \nchoose to use screw-retained prostheses. If cementation is \ndesired, be careful to apply only on the edge of intaglio sur-\nfaces of the crown. Overilling or complete coverage of all \ninner surfaces of the crown is not conducive to avoidance of \ncement extrusion.\nControl of parafunctional forces. A bite guard is critical to \nprevent unfavorable occlusal stress. The night guard is adjusted \nto be on lat plane occlusion to disperse stress. Careful discus-\nsion should be conducted with the dental laboratory to convey \nthe desired design for successful application.\nManagement. The objective of treatment for peri-implantitis \nis for osseous regeneration of the osseous defect. However, this \nproves to be challenging because the implant surface needs to be \ndetoxiied along with modifying the soft and hard tissues. This \nmay involve nonsurgical and surgical treatment (Box 18.4).\nmotion. This allows the thick ribbon to clean on both sides \nof the exposed implant. In areas with tighter, small openings, \na traditional unwaxed loss may be used with a loss threader.\nOral irrigators may be used as an adjunct for removing \nsupragingival soft debris around implants and prostheses. \nHowever, caution should be exercised because incorrect use \nor excessive water pressure may damage the peri-implant \ntissues. Patients should be instructed to use these modalities \non low-medium settings, with the irrigator tip placed in the \ninterproximal area horizontal to the implant and along its \ngingival margin to avoid subgingival spray. Additionally, an \nantimicrobial solution may be used (e.g., chlorhexidine \ngluconate).133\nThe main goal of auxiliary aids is mechanical debride-\nment. Patient adherence to home care is essential. Superloss \nand interdental brushes work by physically engaging plaque \nand tartar. Oral irrigators function by hydraulic pressure to \nforce luid into the subgingival space. It functions by both \nintroduction of oxygen to an anaerobic bacteria dominant \nspace and removal of debris. In addition, chemical agents \nmay be of beneit (e.g., chlorhexidine gluconate, peroxide, \nlow-concentration bleach) and are advocated. Each of these \nsolutions has high capabilities to penetrate bacterial bioilm \nand induce reduction of colonies. Irrigation around implants \nshould be incorporated into patient’s home care regime on a \ndaily basis.\nAntimicrobial Agents. Chlorhexidine gluconate is an anti-\nmicrobial safe and nontoxic adjunct to oral hygiene \nprocedures in the maintenance of dental implants. Chlorhex-\nidine is effective in reducing peri-mucositis because of its \nsubstantivity (i.e., binding to tissue or implant surfaces). \nAdditionally, it allows for ibroblast attachment to implant \nsurfaces. It has a long half-life because the pellicle maintains \nbacteriostasis.\nClinical signiicance. Although regular use may assist in \npatient home care, several adverse side effects may occur for \npatients on routine use of chlorhexidine. Reports of altera-\ntion of taste and staining of teeth are common. It is not \nrecommended to put a patient on long-term use of chlorhexi-\ndine; prescribing use should be at the discretion of prescriber. \nIt is recommended to be given postsurgery for use to assist in \nsoft tissue healing.\nChlorhexidine regimen. Patients are given scripts for 1 \nbottle 0.12% or 0.2% chlorhexidine and are instructed to \nrinse both in the morning after brushing teeth and at night \nbefore going to sleep. Due to side effects, patients should be \nunder close monitoring. It should be noted that other coun-\ntries may have different concentrations of chlorhexidine.\nPeri-Implantitis\nEtiology. Peri-implantitis has been associated with a gram-\nnegative anaerobic microbiota, similar to that found in severe \nperiodontitis around natural teeth.134\nPeri-implantitis encompasses the criteria of peri-mucositis \nand the addition of loss of osseous support.

The clinician should be careful to \nuse the powder only in areas where access is available and a \nposttreatment rinse can remove any residue. This modality is \nbest utilized in cases with buccal dehiscence and or horizontal \nbone loss without crater or infrabony pocketing. Hu-Friedy/ \nEMS produces a device that can be used to effectively dis-\npense glycine air-powder mixtures (Fig. 18.35).\nUltrasonic Devices. When used for treatment of peri-\nimplantitis, tip modiications (i.e., carbon iber, silicone, or \nplastic) must be made. Care must be exercised to not use \nmetal tips because they may alter the implant surface.\nUltrasonic devices should be used only when a plastic tip \nis available. Irrigation and meticulous cleaning is recom-\nmended in treatment for either open lap debridement or \nclosed lap irrigation.\nLaser. The use of lasers is becoming a more recognized treat-\nment for peri-implantitis. Although there are many varieties \nof different wavelength lasers and each serves different type \nof purposes, only Nd:YAG laser has been showing promise. \nNonsurgical Management of Peri-Implantitis\nWhereas the nonsurgical treatment of peri-mucositis is often \nsuccessful, the nonsurgical treatment for peri-implantitis has \na questionable eficacy. This is most likely due to the inability \nto remove the bacterial bioilm from the exposed implant \nsurface. Usually this is more signiicant when the implant \ndesign involves a rough surface.140\nThe nonsurgical treatment of peri-implantitis usually \ninvolves the debridement and detoxiication of implant sur-\nfaces, similar to the treatment of peri-mucositis. However, the \nissue that arises is that these exposed surfaces usually have \nconcurrent subgingival pockets.\nLow-Abrasive Amino Acid Glycine Powder. Low-abrasive \namino acid glycine powder has been shown to be an effective \ntreatment for removing bioilm without damaging the \nimplant surface, hard, and soft tissues. This technique uses a \nspecial handpiece with a plastic tube nozzle with three \northogonally oriented holes. An air-powder mixture with \nreduced pressure is expelled through the nozzle, which pre-\nvents the formation of air emphysema complications.

A sulcular incision is made \naround the implant (one tooth mesial to one tooth distal). A \nfull-thickness lap is relected, exposing the implant surface. \nDebridement of the implant surface is performed initially \nwith curettes or titanium brush. The surface is irrigated with \n40% citric acid, 17% EDTA (ethyl-diamine tetra acetic acid), \nand/or choice of antimicrobial agent. Laser settings are spe-\nciic to each individual laser according to manufacturer pro-\ntocol. Care should be exercised to cover all exposed surfaces \n(i.e., each exposed thread) for the detoxiication process. Use \nof regenerative material (allograft and extended resorbable \nmembrane) is highly recommended. Tissues are modiied \nand sutured to reapproximate tissue for tension-free primary \nclosure. The Nd:YAG LANAP Protocol (discussed earlier) can \nalso be used with advanced peri-implantitis. In addition, \nthere are also rescue approaches which combine laser and \nsurgical therapies.\nNote: It is critical to limit time exposure of the implant \nsurface with the laser application to avoid overheating \nor charring. This may increase implant morbidity and pos-\nsibly lead to premature loss of the implant due to bone \ndisintegration.\nSurgical Management of Peri-Implantitis\nThough nonsurgical treatment of peri-implantitis may be \neffective in some cases, the majority of cases require a more \ninvasive approach to ensure an effective treatment outcome. \nThere are various surgical techniques to treat peri-implantitis, \ndepending on the inal objective (Fig. 18.37)144:\n• Access lap: for cleaning and decontamination of \nimplants with pus, heavy bleeding, or with evidence of \nprobing or craterlike radiographic bone loss.\n• Regenerative procedures: provides access for cleaning, \nplus regeneration procedures for deep crater defects \npast the irst thread of nonmobile implants.\n• Apically positioned lap: provides access for cleaning \nand decontamination, and is used for implants showing \ngeneralized horizontal bone loss past irst thread.\nAccess Flap. This surgical technique is used to maintain \nthe soft tissues around the implant with the goal of decon-\ntamination (Fig. 18.38). A sulcular incision is made around \nthe implant and extends at least one tooth mesial and one \ntooth distal on both the buccal and palatal/lingual side. This \nallows the clinician to have proper visualization and access \nfor the next step. A full-thickness lap relection is performed \nto gain access to the implant and bone surface. Although it is \ndesirable to minimize the incision on healthy tissue, if access \nis inadequate, a vertical incision may be included to gain \nfurther access. Degranulation can be completed with \ncurettes, specialized titanium brushes with an implant hand-\npiece, and/or a glycine polishing handpiece. Along with \nmechanical decontamination, a chemical decontamination \nprocess should be followed, using compounds such as doxy-\ncycline or citric acid. The laps are then reapproximated in \ntheir original position using a horizontal mattress suture, \nThe American Academy of Periodontology (AAP) has con-\ntinued to express reservations on use of lasers in treatment \nof peri-implantitis disease. There is minimal evidence to \nsupport any lasers as the lone treatment modality, although \nthe Er:YAG laser has been shown to be effective for root \ndebridement by assisting calculus removal and reducing \nendotoxin.142 It is important to note that the Er:Yag is a hard \ntissue laser and it is rather damaging when used on implant \nsurfaces without careful monitoring. The damaging effect \nthat accompanies the use of such lasers does not warrant \nrecommendation.\nInvariably, more studies are starting to gravitate toward \nthe regeneration capability of the Nd:YAG laser. Nicholson \net al published very promising results of visible osseous \nregeneration around failing implants.143 In 2016, the FDA \nawarded clearance for the Nd:YAG LANAP Protocol for peri-\nodontal regeneration (FDA Clearance 510 (k) 151763). The \nLANAP Protocol results in the “true regeneration of the \nattachment apparatus (new cementum, new periodontal liga-\nment, and new alveolar bone)” on previously diseased root \nsurfaces. A companion protocol, LAPIP, may be used to \naddress mild to moderate peri-implantitis.143a (Fig. 18.36).\nTreatment procedure. If the clinician desires to use lasers, \nthe irst step is to verify with manufacturer whether the spe-\nciic brand of lasers under consideration is suitable for \nimplant use or not (e.g., Er-YAG hard tissue lasers are con-\ntraindicated for dental implant use).

This surgical technique is used for \nimplants that have generalized horizontal bone loss past \nthe irst thread when regeneration is not considered feasible \n(Fig. 18.40). An internal bevel incision or sulcular incision fol-\nlowing the implant is made. Two vertical incisions are added \non the mesial and distal of the implant creating a pyramidal \nlap.

On the lingual/palatal a \ngingivectomy may be performed at the level of the anticipated \ninal gingival height. Being mindful of the attached keratinized \ntissue, a submarginal incision may be performed in cases where \nample amounts of keratinized tissue are present (e.g., palate). \nIdeally, a partial-thickness lap is recommended because it will \nhelp apical lap adaptation; however, a full-thickness lap eleva-\ntion technique may be easier in tight-access areas.\nOnce relected, similar treatment as the access lap may be \nperformed.

The color, contour, and \ntexture of the soft tissue drape should be similar around \nimplants and teeth when in the esthetic zone. The interdental \npapillae should ideally ill the interproximal spaces. A high \nsmile line often exposes the free gingival margin and inter-\ndental papillae zones. The keratinized tissue is more resistant \nto abrasion. As a result, hygiene aids are more comfortable to \nuse, and mastication is less likely to cause discomfort. The \ndegree of gingival recession appears related to the absence of \nkeratinized gingiva. Root sensitivity and esthetic concerns \nmay be associated with gingival recession. From a restorative \ndental aspect, keratinized mucosa is more manageable during \nthe retraction and impression-making process. Subgingival \nmargin placement is improved, as is long-term stability in the \npresence of keratinized tissue. Many of these beneits directly \napply to the soft tissue around an implant.\nNatural teeth typically have two primary types of tissue: \nattached, keratinized gingiva and unattached, nonkeratinized \nmucosa. The type of tissue around a dental implant is more \nvaried than natural teeth. After bone loss in the maxilla, \nexcess tissue is often found, and the tissue is usually keratin-\nized, unattached gingiva. An implant placed in the region \nmay also have keratinized, unattached tissue. The tissues \naround the implant may also be similar to most natural teeth, \nsurrounded by keratinized, attached gingiva (Fig. 18.42). \nThe tissues may be nonkeratinized, unattached mucosa, \nmore often in the mandible after bone height loss or after a \nand hard tissue as long as patients maintain good oral \nhygiene (Fig. 18.41).148,149\nOn the other side of the issue, some authors consider \nkeratinized attached gingiva important.

The formation of an \ninterdental/implant papillae is completely unpredictable with \nmobile nonkeratinized tissues. When the nonkeratinized \ntissue is mobile, several reports state that this is unsatisfac-\ntory. Ono et al have proposed a classiication of attached \ngingiva and surgical alternatives to improve soft tissue types \nin edentulous sites for implant placement.156 Meffert et al \nrecommend ideally adequate keratinized tissue before implant \nplacement, especially in the posterior regions.157\nInterestingly, the studies that have advocated the need for \nkeratinized mucosa around dental implants have primarily \ninvestigated implants with rough surfaces. Failure of rough-\nsurface implants (e.g., hydroxyapatite-coated and plasma-\nsprayed cylinder-shaped implants) have been related to a lack \nof keratinized mucosa.158 On the other hand, the studies that \nhave questioned the need of keratinized mucosa around \ndental implants have examined implants with smooth sur-\nfaces. A meta-analysis of the literature performed on the \nsubject by Esposito et al reported 20% fewer instances of \nperi-implantitis in smooth-surface implants compared with \nrough-surface implants.159\nAnother beneit of keratinized tissue is the clinical ease of \ntreatment to reduce pocket depths if crestal bone loss occurs. \nProbing depths 6 mm or more are more often associated with \nanaerobic bacteria. If the implant is out of the esthetic zone, \na gingivectomy to reduce pocket depth is very predictable. An \napically positioned lap with nonkeratinized mucosa is less \npredictable and is more dificult to perform.\nHowever, it should be noted that several reports demon-\nstrate the long-term implant survival in the absence of kera-\ntinized tissue. Although reports are more cautious with \nmobile mucosa next to an implant, nonmobile tissue rather \nthan keratinized tissue appears to be the primary criterion \nrelative to tissue type.\nA study by Chung et al evaluated the signiicance of kera-\ntinized mucosa in the maintenance of dental implants with \ndifferent surface conditions.160 All 69 patients and 339 \nimplants in the study had implant restorations for at least 3 \nyears and as long as 24 years with an average of 8.1 years. \nbone graft and lap advancement to approximate the gingiva \n(Fig. 18.43). The nonkeratinized tissue may also be attached \nwhen acellular tissue (Alloderm [BioHorizons IPH, Inc.]) is \npositioned under the periosteum and bounds the overlying \ntissues to the bone.\nThe need for keratinized tissue around dental implants \nseems more controversial than that around teeth. In theory, \nstructural differences in implants compared with teeth make \nthem more susceptible to the development of inlammation \nand bone loss when exposed to plaque accumulation or \nmicrobial invasion (e.g., less vascular supply, fewer ibro-\nblasts, lack of connective tissue attachment to cementa-\ntion).26,152 Some reports indicate the lack of keratinized tissue \nmay contribute to implant failure. Kirsch and Ackermann \nreported that the most important criterion for implant health \nin the posterior mandible was related to the absence or pres-\nence of keratinized gingiva.153 In this report, mobile, nonke-\nratinized mucosa exhibited greater probing depths, which \nwas histologically conirmed. A study by Warrer et al in \nmonkeys found that an absence of keratinized mucosa \nincreases the susceptibility of peri-implant regions to plaque-\ninduced destruction.154\nThe presence of keratinized tissue next to an oral implant \npresents some unique beneits compared to natural teeth. \nKeratinized gingiva has more hemidesmosomes; the JEA zone \nmay be of beneit when in keratinized tissue. Whereas the \norientation of collagen ibers in the connective tissue zone of \nan implant may appear perpendicular to the implant surface, \nthese ibers in mobile, nonkeratinized tissue run parallel to \nthe surface of the implant. Schroeder et al, James et al, and \nListgarten et al have suggested that mobile mucosa may \ndisrupt the implant-epithelial attachment zone and contrib-\nute to an increased risk of inlammation from plaque \n(Fig. 18.44).40,155 In addition to the general advantages of \nkeratinized tissue stated for teeth, keratinized tissue around \nimplants may also be beneicial in several other ways.

It is \nimportant to notify patient that the normal transformation \nof Alloderm may have undesired side effects during the early \nstages of healing.\nPeri-Implant Mucosal Hyperplasia\nGingival overgrowth (hyperplasia) around the peri-implant \nmucosa has been recognized as a signiicant clinical issue in \nimplant dentistry today. The hyperplastic161 tissue complica-\ntion has been also termed in the literature as implant gingival \nhyperplasia, mucosal proliferation, proliferative gingivitis, and \nimplant-related tissue hyperplasia.162 The gingival overgrowth \nresults in extreme dificulty for the patient to maintain ade-\nquate hygiene and the clinician in performing debridement. \nWhen gingival overgrowth is associated with radiographic \nbone loss, the resultant periodontal pockets are expressed as \n“true” periodontal pockets. If there is no associated bone loss, \nthe pockets are termed pseudopockets. These hyperplasia-\ninduced pockets may harbor pathogenic anaerobic bacteria. \nThe plaque bioilm colonization and maturation in implant \npockets initiates inlammation. The resultant hyperplastic \ntissue is most commonly composed of compact collagenous \nibers, ibroblasts, and inlammatory cells.163 This may result \nBleeding index, modiied plaque index, gingival index, \nprobing depth, width of attached keratinized mucosa, and \namount of attached mucosa were recorded. In addition, \naverage annual bone loss was calculated using past and \npresent radiographs. Gingival inlammation and plaque \naccumulation were signiicantly higher in patients with less \nthan 2 mm of keratinized mucosa or 1 mm of attached \nmucosa. The surface condition of the implant was not statisti-\ncally signiicant in this study, although the smooth implants \nwith less than 2 mm of keratinized mucosa were less stable \nthan other groups relative to the soft tissue proile.\nThis study also found the average annual bone loss was \nnot inluenced by the amount of keratinized or attached \nmucosa or the type of implant surface coniguration (smooth \nvs. rough). The greatest amount of bone loss was observed \nwith rough implants in keratinized mucosa of less than 1 mm, \nbut the difference was not statically relevant. The presence of \nkeratinized mucosa in this study was most signiicantly \nadvantageous in the soft tissue health of posterior implants, \nas indicated by the gingival index. Posterior implants, even in \nthe presence of keratinized tissue, had a 3.5-fold higher annual \nbone loss than anterior implants in this study (0.14 vs. \n0.04 mm).158 Implant location appears more important than \nthe presence or absence of keratinized mucosa.\nThe question relative to the need for keratinized tissue \naround implants should be modiied to, “Which would you \nprefer?” No one in the literature has stated that the nonkera-\ntinized tissue is more preferable than keratinized tissue; the \ncontroversy is abated. Some authors prefer keratinized \nmucosa more intensely than others. If one side of the contro-\nversy demonstrates beneits while the other side states that \nkeratinized tissue is not mandatory, both sides may be correct.\nIn speciic clinical instances, attached, keratinized gingiva \nis more often desirable. For example, a ixed prosthesis (FP-1) \nin the esthetic zone requires keratinized mucosa to develop \nthe soft tissue drape around the implant crowns. A second \nprime example is a mandibular overdenture, which beneits \nfrom a vestibule and zone of nonmobile tissue around the \nimplant abutments.\nManagement of Lack of Keratinized Tissue\nTissue augmentation can be completed prior to surgery, con-\ncurrent with surgery, or post implant surgery. The most ideal \ntime to graft is prior to surgery; however, patients may not \nlike to have additional surgeries. The treatment at all three \ntimeframes is similar.\nUse of Alloderm requires periods of familiarity with mate-\nrial. Prior experience with handling is recommended.\nPresurgical \nAugmentations. Presurgical \naugmentation \nsteps are as follows:\n1. A trapezoidal lap is relected from the desired areas of \ngrafting.\n2.

Additionally, gingival hyperplasia may \nmake it impossible for a prosthesis to be completely seated \n(i.e., bar overdenture) or give rise to chronic tissue soreness.\nEtiology. After clinical diagnosis of implant-related gingival \novergrowth, potential etiologies must be identiied such as \nhormonal, medication induced, allergy induced, and patient-\nrelated habits. Various hormonal factors (e.g., related to preg-\nnancy or puberty) and medications have been associated with \nthe gingival overgrowth. Medications such as phenytoin (i.e., \nDilantin), immunosupressants (e.g., cyclosporine), calcium \nchannel blockers, and amphetamines have been associated \nwith gingival hyperplasia. Gingival overgrowth has also been \nassociated with patient habits such as mouth breathing. \nAllergy-induced hyperplasia is also becoming more prevalent \nin implant dentistry. With the use of titanium alloys for the \nfabrication of the dental implants and abutments, exacer-\nbated allergic reactions are becoming a more common \nproblem.

If a patient is considered to be at high risk for \nimplant-related gingival hyperplasia (e.g., because of medica-\ntions), they should be instructed to maintain meticulous \nhygiene. Additionally, a more frequent recall protocol (3–4 \ntimes per year) should be implemented that includes debride-\nment. The prosthesis should be evaluated and maintained \nwith a minimum of 1 mm of space between the tissue and \nthe prosthesis for ease of cleaning and prevention of \nprosthesis-induced irritation.\nManagement. Management of peri-implant gingival over-\ngrowth should include the determination of the etiology \n(e.g., medication or humoral). If the etiology is determined \nto be medication induced, consultation with the patient’s \nphysician is recommended for possible alternative treatment \n(Table 18.8).\nThe treatment of peri-implant hyperplasia should begin \nwith conventional periodontal therapies to reduce plaque \nbioilm and inlammation. The surgical management of \nimplant gingival overgrowth may require gingivectomy (if \nadequate keratinized gingiva is present) or apically positioned \nlaps (without adequate keratinized gingiva).\nThe use of 0.12% chlorhexidine daily has been shown to \nbe successful in reducing tissue overgrowth and bacteria \ncounts.165 When gingival hyperplasia is present around \nimplants associated with overdentures, care should be exer-\ncised to minimize further enlargement (Fig. 18.45).

The treatment \nindicated for group II implants consists of a stress reduction \nprotocol for the implant system, shorter intervals between \nhygiene appointments (e.g., 9 months), reinforcement of oral \nhygiene instructions, annual radiographs until the crestal \nbone has stabilized, and gingivoplasty or sulcus reduction \nprocedures where indicated. The prognosis is good to very \ngood depending on the depth of the implant sulcus.\nFor pockets less than 6 mm in depth, the following can be \nconcluded175:\n1. Mechanical therapy alone or combined with chlorhexi-\ndine results in the clinical resolution of periimplant \nmucositis lesions.\n2. Histologically, both treatments result in minimal \ninlammation compatible with health.\n3. The mechanical effect alone is suficient to attain clini-\ncal and histologic resolution of mucositis lesions.\nGroup III: Compromised Survival\nGroup III implants are classiied as compromised survival \nand exhibit a slight to moderate peri-implantitis and com-\npromised health status. Peri-implantitis is deined as an \ninlammatory process affecting the tissue around an implant \nthat results in loss of supporting bone.\nGroup III implants are characterized by radiographically \nevident vertical bone loss, periimplant pocket, bleeding on \nprobing (plus occasional suppuration), and mucosal swelling \nand redness but no pain upon function (Fig. 18.48).\nThese implants warrant more aggressive clinical therapy. \nNo pain is apparent in function, but tenderness may be \nslight on percussion or function. No vertical or initial hori-\nzontal mobility (IM-0) is evident. Greater than 4 mm of \ncrestal bone loss has occurred since implant insertion but \nless than half the length of the implant. Greater than 7 mm \nand increasing probing depths are also present, usually \naccompanied by bleeding when probing. Exudate episodes \nmay have lasted more than 1 to 2 weeks and may be accom-\npanied by a slight radiolucency evident around a crestal \nregion of the implant.\nGroup III implants warrant aggressive surgical and pros-\nthetic intervention. Stress factors are also addressed. The \nprosthesis may be removed in nonesthetic regions, or the bar \nmay be removed under overdentures during the surgical \ntherapy. Modiication of the occlusal scheme and methods to \ndecrease the forces in the aflicted regions after hard and soft \ntissue surgical treatment include decreasing cantilever length, \nocclusal adjustment, and occlusal splint therapy.\nIn cases of rapid bone changes, the prosthesis design may \nbe modiied completely from a ixed to a removable restora-\ntion to stress relief and soft tissue support. Additional implants \nto support the restoration may be indicated, especially if the \npatient is unwilling to wear a removable prosthesis.\nSystemic and topical antibiotics and local chemical \nagents such as chlorhexidine are indicated in the presence of \nexudate.\nHowever, this method is usually of short-term beneit if \nthe causative agents of implant failure are not eliminated. \nBacterial culture and sensitivity tests (Oral Microbiology \nTesting Service, Temple University, Philadelphia; www \n.temple.edu) may be indicated, especially if existing signs and \nsymptoms do not subside within a few weeks. Surgical man-\nagement most often consists of soft tissue removal or expo-\nsure of a portion of the implant. Bone grafts may be used \nalong with these approaches around the implant. A three-step \napproach is implemented for this category in the following \norder: (1) antimicrobial therapy (local or systemic), (2) stress \nreduction, and (3) surgical intervention.\nThe prognosis is good to guarded, depending on the ability \nto reduce and control stress after the surgical corrections have \nimproved the soft and hard tissue health."

The \nimplant should be removed under any of these conditions: (1) \npain on palpation, percussion, or function; (2) greater than \n0.5 mm of horizontal mobility; (3) any vertical mobility; (4) \nuncontrolled progressive bone loss; (5) uncontrolled exudate; \n(6) more than 50% bone loss around the implant; (7) general-\nized radiolucency; or (8) implants surgically placed but unable \nto be restored (sleepers). Implants that are surgically removed \nor exfoliated are also in the category of failure.\nThis category also includes implants surgically removed or \nexfoliated and no longer in the mouth. The remaining edentu-\nlous area often is treated with autogenous or synthetic bone \ngraft procedures, which are performed to replace the missing \nbone. After the favorable bony conditions are restored, implants \nmay be inserted again with a good prognosis (Fig. 18.49).\nThe terminology for implant failure often is confusing, \nwith different terms describing similar situations. Terminol-\nogy for implant failure using the time period of failure has \nbeen suggested as a primary criterion. Many implant failures \nare not described ideally by the time of the complication and \nare not addressed in this nomenclature.\nOccasionally, the patient will not permit removal of the \nimplant. Regardless of whether the patient returns for implant \nremoval, the implant is recorded as a failure in all statistical \ndata. The patient should be warned against the irreversible \ndamage to the surrounding bone with implants retained in \nthis condition. Consideration should be given to their removal \nbecause future treatment may be compromised.\nCONCLUSION\nOnce the surgical and prosthetic phases of implant therapy \nhave been completed, the work of the clinician is not over. \nPatients must be educated in regards to proper maintenance \nof their implant-supported restorations, and routine exami-\nnations should be performed to monitor overall health. Many \ndifferences exist in the biologies of natural teeth vs. implants \nas they pertain to periodontal status, and it is critically impor-\ntant that the implant dentist recognize these differences, \nproperly diagnose disease states, and effectively manage issues \nshould they arise. By understanding the etiologies of the \nvarious peri-implant disease states, a clinician can work with \nthe patient to build an effective protocol of prevention.\nFIG 18.48 (A) Group III implants have a compromised health \nstatus and warrant a surgical procedure to decrease the risk \nof further deterioration. Probing on the facial of this implant \nindicates a 6-mm pocket, and exudate is present. (B) This \nimplant required surgical reentry to decontaminate the \nsurface of the implant and remove the noxious elements. A \nreduction of thread depth and a bone graft or apical-positioned \nlap was indicated. (From Misch CE: Dental implant prosthet-\nics, ed 2, St Louis, 2015, Mosby.)\nA\nB"

    "content": "827\nMedicolegal Aspects of Implant Dentistry\nRandolph R. Resnik, Francis R. DeLuca\n19 \nIn dentistry today, dental practitioners are exposed to an \narray of possible legal liability claims. These claims may arise \nfrom the various components of civil, criminal, and admin-\nistrative legal systems at either the state or federal level \n(Fig. 19.1). In the ield of oral implantology an ever-increasing \nnumber of legal claims are occurring. For this reason, any \ndiscussion of implant dentistry complications must necessar-\nily include a review of the legal risks and ramiications associ-\nated with this type of treatment. Practitioners engaged in oral \nimplantology must practice effective risk management, or \nthey may predispose themselves to the loss of time and money \nassociated with unwanted litigation and administrative pro-\nceedings. Although the possibility of legal claims may be an \naccepted risk and complication of implant dentistry, it is \nlargely an avoidable risk.\nAs a dentist, the chances of being named in a medical \nnegligence lawsuit are approximately 1 : 200 per year depend-\ning upon your jurisdiction, and to some extent, your spe-\ncialty.1 According to recent data from the National Practitioner \nData Bank (NPDP), 11% of medical malpractice cases \ninvolved the practice of dentistry. NPDP studies show that \napproximately 8500 dentists in the United States are named \nas defendants each year in dental malpractice suits, with an \naverage payout of approximately $68,000.2 Over 97% of these \npayments are from out-of-court settlements prior to trial.3 As \nthe cost of modern dental care rises, it is likely these numbers \nwill only grow because it becomes more economically worth-\nwhile to pursue dental malpractice claims. On the other hand, \nrisk is something that can and should be managed and \navoided. However, in reality, even with the best planning and \ncare, oral implantology complications may predispose the \npractitioner to legal action (Box 19.1).\nThe prevalence and type of complications in implant den-\ntistry are increasing and evolving over time. This is most likely \ndue to three factors. First, there is an increase in the number of \nimplants being placed every year. Secondly, more complex and \ndificult procedures with higher morbidity are being performed. \nAnd lastly, more dentists with limited training are providing \nimplant treatment, including practitioners with a lack of expe-\nrience and knowledge in the prevention and treatment of com-\nplications. The standard of care in oral implantology is not \nprecise in part because there is an absence of a recognized \nspecialty of oral implantology. Yet the standard of care in oral \nimplantology is an ever-rising bar due to the increasing com-\nplexity of cases and the expertise demanded by patients.\nUnfortunately, complications do occur in implant den-\ntistry, and they are sometimes unavoidable. In the early days \nof oral implantology, complications were merely termed \n“risks” of the procedure. In today’s litigious society, patients \noften equate complications with “malpractice” or a deviation \nfrom the standard of care by the practitioner. Many patients \nhave invested substantial amounts of time, energy, and money \nin their appearance and dental care. When complications \narise or expectations are not met, patients often demand \nanswers and seek a legal course of action. Strategically and \ncorrectly managing complications is paramount in the pre-\nvention of medical negligence liability claims.\nImplant dentistry is an acquired skill requiring extensive \ntraining, continuous practice, and reinement of skills and \ntechnique. Some dentists will take a 2-day weekend course \nsponsored by a dental implant manufacturer and assume they \nhave the knowledge and skills necessary to treat even the most \ndificult cases and complications. However, they are mistaken, \nand this has been substantiated through various studies. \nLambert et al, in a landmark study evaluating inexperienced \nsurgeons (<50 implants placed), found that doctors early on \ntheir learning curve were twice as likely to have failed implants \nin comparison to experienced surgeons.4\nThe authors have noticed a trend in dental malpractice litiga-\ntion termed the “500–4000 syndrome.” Dental implant litigation \nseems to spike in the irst 500 implants placed by a dentist simply \nbecause dentists on the front end of the learning curve are more \nlikely to experience complications. The good news is that, with \nadditional experience, the number of litigation cases levels out \nin the range of 500–4000 implant placements. However, a second \nspike of litigation occurs after the placement of approximately \n4000 implants. Clinicians often become complacent, and there \nis a greater chance to “take shortcuts” in the treatment of implant \npatients. They tend to be lax with their preoperative assessment \n(clinical and radiographic evaluation), do not keep current with \nthe literature, and fail to attend appropriate continuing educa-\ntion programs while managing their busy practices.\nThe malpractice litigation process is embarrassing, time \nconsuming, and inancially and psychologically draining on \nthe practitioner. This long, drawn-out malpractice process has \nbeen shown to have an average time from injury to resolution \nof 5 years, with 33% of cases lasting over 6 years.5 However, \ndental implant practitioners can take proactive steps to \ndecrease their risk liability and to minimize their exposure. In \nthis chapter we will examine the best ways to avoid lawsuits"

The irst part \nof the litigation is called the “presuit period.” The presuit \nperiod is very important because the clinician will usually \nreceive notice of commencement of a legal action, and they \nmust react promptly. Most doctors are not taken by surprise \nwhen a patient initiates legal action against them because \nthere are often subtle signs. These include the patient not \nreturning for scheduled appointments, failure to return \nphone calls from the doctor or the ofice, or refusing to pay \ntheir bill. More signiicant indications that are consistent with \na patient bringing a legal action include a formal notice or a \nrequest for their dental chart by the patient, another practi-\ntioner, or a patient’s lawyer. Most often in such situations \nverbal communication between the dentist and patient has \ndeteriorated or may have become nonexistent.\nNotiication\nRecords Request. The initiation of a lawsuit usually starts \nwith a request for records. When presented with a records \nrequest from a patient, it is imperative that the practitioner \nnot ignore the request no matter how unfounded the poten-\ntial claim may be. In most states, there is a statute (law) that \ngoverns the time period that the dental provider has to \ncomply with the request. Refusing to fulill a patient’s request \nfor a copy of their treatment record in a timely manner will \nonly complicate and exacerbate the situation and may preju-\ndice the dentist’s position in future litigation. This will also \ncast the doctor in a negative light from the outset of the litiga-\ntion in the eyes of the court and also with the state dental \nboard. Although the doctor owns the actual dental record, the \npatient owns the diagnostic images, and they are entitled to \nand also review the litigation process, including presuit, the \ndiscovery process, and malpractice trial (Fig. 19.2).\nLITIGATION PROCESS PART 1\nPRESUIT\nWhen a patient enters into a civil lawsuit, they will initiate a \nprocess termed litigation. Litigation is governed by various \nFIG 19.1 US legal system. Dental practitioners are subject to a wide array of potential legal \nissues within the statutory, civil, and criminal legal systems.

The dentist may also receive a letter \nfrom the patient’s attorney informing them of their intent to \ninitiate a legal action on behalf of a patient and that the \nattorney is investigating the matter. Some states require that \nthe patient provide a “Presuit Notice” prior to the formal \niling of a lawsuit. This will initiate the presuit period, which \nallows the patient and doctor the ability to obtain records \nand provides both sides an opportunity to settle the matter \nprior to litigation. The form and method of the notice of \ncommencing a presuit is usually dictated by state statute \nor rule. For example, the state of Florida requires that notice \nbe provided by certiied US mail or return receipt requested \n(Fig. 19.4).\nRequirements After Receiving Notice\nThe irst step or action that an insured dentist should take \nafter receiving notice is to inform their dental malpractice \ninsurance carrier of the possibility of a malpractice suit. By \nplacing the dental malpractice insurance carrier on notice, \nthe dentist will have access to immediate guidance and legal \nadvice from the carrier or an appointed attorney for all \naspects of the ensuing process. In general, by informing the \ncarrier, no adverse consequences will result, such as losing \ncoverage or increased premiums.\nResponsibility of the Insured Dentist\nProactive response. If the doctor receives a request for \ndental records from the patient or their attorney, a proactive \nresponse to inform the insurance carrier is mandatory. To \npreserve malpractice coverage, most policies require the \ninsured to inform the carrier with prompt notice of any \npotential claims. An insured dentist’s failure to provide notice \nin a timely manner could potentially jeopardize the carrier’s \nobligations both to defend and to indemnify (pay for the \ndamage or loss allegedly suffered by the patient) in the \na copy of both parts of their dental records. When a patient \nis denied access to their records by a dentist, their only \nrecourse may be to ile a complaint with the state board \nof dentistry. Under those circumstances, it is unlikely the \nstate board will be sympathetic to the claims or concerns \nof the practitioner and may expose the dentist to discipline \n(Fig. 19.3).\nTime to respond. The time to respond to a request by a \npatient for their records is dictated speciically by individual \nstate law, with the average deadline to provide records being \napproximately 30 days. Some states do not have associated \ntime periods (e.g., Alaska) or use terminology such as “a \nreasonable time” (e.g., Alabama).6 A records request does \nhave to be accompanied by a HIPAA-compliant medical \nauthorization form.\nDocumentation of records request. As a matter of ofice \npolicy, no records should be provided by a dental ofice or its \npersonnel to a patient either “in person” or via written request \nwithout the treating doctor’s prior approval. In doing so, the \ndoctor will be able to ensure the patient is provided with the \nexact information requested. The patient chart should be \ndocumented accordingly, including notations documenting \nthe exact records provided (i.e., make an additional copy), the \ndate the records are delivered, and the manner in which the \nrecords were provided (e.g., US mail, fax, wire, or email). It \nis best to keep records establishing the exact date such materi-\nals were provided (example, “certiied mail/return receipt \nrequested”). Documenting the date the record request was \nmade by the patient is especially important where the statute \nof limitations (i.e., maximum time after the alleged negligent \nevent to initiate legal action to pursue a claim relating to it \nor otherwise it may be deemed “time barred” by law) may \nbecome an issue with respect to the iling of the lawsuit. The \nterm time-bar refers to a legal claim that is barred by the \npassage of time under a statute of limitations.\nFIG 19.2 Anatomy of a civil malpractice suit.

Counsel will \nprovide guidance concerning the discovery process. The \ndefense attorney will be responsible for iling the appropriate \nresponsive pleadings and ensuring the dentist’s legal rights \nare protected. Presuit time periods and requirements are dic-\ntated by the applicable state law and vary greatly.\nPersonal Counsel. Depending on the signiicance of the \npotential claim or issues relating to insurance coverage, the \ndentist should consider retaining independent personal \ncounsel to assist and serve as the doctor’s liaison with counsel \nhired by the dental malpractice insurance company. The \nhiring of personal counsel is particularly important if the \nclaim exposes the doctor to a potential judgment in excess of \ntheir policy limits or if the insurance carrier has indicated it \nmay not indemnify the doctor against the claims asserted by \nthe patient. Personal counsel may be particularly helpful in \ncases where the doctor’s insurance carrier has the right to \nsettle a claim without the doctor’s consent (i.e., no consent \nto settle clause). However, a personal council should have a \nbackground and experience with dental malpractice cases.\nIf the dentist’s malpractice insurance policy does not \ncontain a deductible, all legal fees and litigation expenses \n(except legal fees paid to personal counsel) will be paid for \nby the dental malpractice insurance carrier. Despite this fee \narrangement, the defense attorney has a iduciary duty to the \ndentist, not the dental malpractice insurance carrier. The \nattorney retained on behalf of the insured has an obligation \nto preserve the doctor’s conidences and may not allow the \ndental malpractice insurance carrier to interfere with the \nattorney’s professional judgment and recommendations (e.g., \nsettlement of a case because it would be in the best interests \nof the insurance carrier).\nPlaintiff’s Requirements for the  \nFiling of a Lawsuit\nPrior to initiating a lawsuit against a doctor, the following \nfour elements must be proven by the patient/plaintiff by a \npreponderance (greater than 50%) of the evidence.7\n1. Existence of Duty: The patient must prove there exists a \npatient-doctor relationship, and the doctor had a duty to \ntreat the patient. First, a professional relationship must be \nestablished, which usually involves the doctor initiating \ntreatment.\n2. Breach of Duty: The patient must demonstrate the doctor \nbreached or deviated from the standard of care (i.e., was \nnegligent). This would include treatment that is outside the \nscope of what a prudent practitioner would do in a similar \ncircumstance. Standard of care is typically determined by \nthe individual experts retained by each side to give their \nopinions concerning the circumstances involving the case.\n3. Causation Directly Related to the Treatment: There exists a \nconnection between the treatment rendered, or failure to \npotential lawsuit. The dental malpractice insurance carrier \nrequires immediate notice to become involved as early pos-\nsible in the matter of a dental malpractice claim.\nCooperation. Most dental malpractice insurance policies \ncontain a “cooperation clause,” which requires the insured \n(dentist) to cooperate in the defense of a legal claim. If the \ninsured dentist fails to cooperate with the defense of the suit, \nthe malpractice carrier may refuse to indemnify for a lawsuit. \nNo matter how much of a nuisance or how frivolous a dentist \nmay feel a lawsuit may be, it is important to take the time to \ncooperate in defending it.\nResponsibility of Insurance Carrier\nDefense and indemnity. The insurance carrier has two \nmain obligations to the insured with respect to malpractice \npolicies. The “duty to defend” will require the insurance \ncarrier to retain legal counsel for the insured in the defense \nagainst any legal claims brought against the dentist. There \nalso exists the “duty to indemnify,” which requires the insur-\nance carrier to pay for any settlement or judgment on claims \nwithin the policy limits.\nAssignment of counsel. An insurance carrier has an obli-\ngation to retain legal counsel when a legal action is brought \nagainst a dentist. Typically, the insurance carrier will assign \nan attorney who has had past experience with the type of \nmalpractice suit iled. All attorneys’ fees will be paid by the \ncarrier; however, a dental malpractice insurance carrier will \nnot pay for personal counsel hired by a dentist. Most insur-\nance carriers will take into consideration a dentist’s recom-\nmendation for legal council, as long as the attorney has \nexperience in dental litigation cases.\nConsent to settle. With most dental malpractice insur-\nance policies, a “consent clause” is contained within the con-\ntract. This requires the insurance carrier to obtain the dentist’s \nconsent in order to settle a case. If the dentist does give the \ncarrier consent, the dentist will surrender his or her right to \nthe insurance company on the decision to settle the case. \nHowever, for the insurance carrier to protect their interests, \nthey will include a “Hammer Clause” in the malpractice \npolicy. This clause will stipulate that if the dentist refuses to \nconsent to an out-of-court settlement recommended by the \ninsurer, the insurer’s liability for the claim will not exceed the \namount for which the claim could have been settled. There-\nfore, the dentist may be responsible for any additional defense \ncosts incurred and any excess amount above the recom-\nmended settlement amount.\nAppointment of Legal Council\nDefense Counsel Appointment. The dentist should inquire \nrelative to the assigned attorney’s dental knowledge, how \nmany dental implant malpractice cases the lawyer has \nsettled or tried to a jury, and the results obtained in such \nproceedings. If the doctor is not comfortable with their \nappointed attorney, they may request new counsel from their \ninsurance carrier. This request should be made early in the \nlitigation process. In most cases, a dentist may request a par-\nticular defense attorney, if the attorney has the necessary"

Occurrence of Related Damages: The patient must demon-\nstrate there are damages that have resulted from the doc-\ntor’s deviation from the standard of care. Damages may \ninclude physical and/or mental claims.\nAfidavit of Merit. In many states a medical or dental mal-\npractice suit may not be iled until an expert witness signs an \nafidavit of merit. To obtain an afidavit of merit, the plain-\ntiff’s council will need to send the pertinent records to a \npotential expert witness for evaluation of negligence and \nproximate cause issues. The expert witness does have to be \nfamiliar with the appropriate standard of care with regards \nto the case and be willing to sign an afidavit of merit, which \nis usually iled with the complaint. The afidavit of merit in \nsimple terms must state that in the opinion of the expert \nwitness, the dentist in question deviated from the standard \nof care. The reviewing expert does not necessarily have to \nagree to testify as an expert witness. This afidavit of merit is \na relatively recent requirement intended to minimize the \niling of frivolous malpractice actions clogging an otherwise \noverloaded court system (Fig. 19.5).\nStatute of Limitations. In most states a patient must bring \na medical malpractice claim fairly quickly—often between 6 \nmonths and 2 years, depending on the state. Generally, this \ntime period within which to ile a lawsuit is termed the statute \nof limitations. A failure on the part of the patient to initiate a \nclaim within the applicable statutory time limit will lead to \nthe claim being “time-barred” or past the deadline to ile a \nlawsuit (Table 19.1). However, in special circumstances, the \nstatute of limitations may be extended by three possible \nsituations:\n1. Failure to Discover the Basis of the Lawsuit: When a patient \nhas been unable to discover the “basis” (cause of injury) of \nthe lawsuit, the patient may be allowed to ile within a “rea-\nsonable time” after the discovery of the issue in question. \nThis may result from “fraudulent concealment by the \ndentist.” Most notably, this occurs when the dentist does not \ninform the patient of a complication (e.g., broken ile or bur, \nretained cement). In such instances, the time for calculating \nthe statute of limitations does not begin until the patient \ncould have reasonably known they were the victim of neg-\nligence, and most often this is when a subsequent doctor is \nconsulted who informs them of the circumstances.\n2. Notice Letter: in most states, the sending of a notice letter \nwill extend the statute of limitations (e.g., Texas will extend \nthe statute of limitations by 75 days after iling notice). In \nPennsylvania, it is the Writ of Summons, which is iled with \nthe courts to toll the statute of limitations, and this informs \nthe doctor they are about to be named in a lawsuit. Counsel \nfor the doctor may then ile a Rule to File Complaint, which \ngives the patient or their lawyer 2 weeks, within which a \nsuit must be iled.\n3. Minor Plaintiff: The statute of limitations does not begin \nto run until the minor plaintiff is 18 years old. In certain \n*time varies according to type of injury or when injury was \ndiscovered.\nTABLE 19.1 Statute of Limitations by State\nState\nStatute of \nLimitation\nAlabama*\n2 or 4 \nyears\nAlaska\n2 years\nArizona\n2 years\nArkansas\n3 years\nCalifornia*\n1 or 3 \nyears\nColorado\n2 years\nConnecticut*\n2 or 3 \nyears\nD.C.\n3 years\nDelaware\n2 years\nFlorida*\n2 or 4 \nyears\nGeorgia\n2 years\nHawaii*\n2 or 6 \nyears\nIdaho\n2 years\nIllinois\n2 years\nIndiana\n2 years\nIowa\n2 years\nKansas\n2 years\nKentucky\n1 year\nLouisiana\n1 year\nMaine\n3 years\nMaryland*\n3 or 5 \nyears\nMassachusetts\n3 years\nMichigan\n2 years\nMinnesota\n4 years\nMississippi*\n2 or 7 \nyears\nMissouri*\n2 or 10 \nyears\nState\nStatute of \nLimitation\nMontana\n3 years\nNebraska\n2 years\nNevada*\n2 or 4 \nyears\nNew \nHampshire\n3 years\nNew Jersey\n2 years\nNew Mexico\n3 years\nNew York\n2 and a \nhalf \nyears\nNorth \nCarolina*\n3 to 10 \nyears\nNorth Dakota\n2 years\nOhio*\n1 or 4 \nyears\nOklahoma\n2 years\nOregon\n2 years\nPennsylvania\n2 years\nRhode Island\n3 years\nSouth Carolina\n3 years\nSouth Dakota\n2 years\nTennessee\n1 year\nTexas\n2 years\nUtah\n2 years\nVermont\n3 years\nVirginia*\n2 to 10 \nyears\nWashington\n3 years\nWest Virginia\n2 years\nWisconsin\n3 years\nWyoming\n2 years\nstates, this will allow for the delay of the iling of the \nlawsuit to the age of 20 (i.e., 18 years of age + 2 years) for \na minor patient and guardian to initiate a legal action.\nFiling of the Lawsuit\nA malpractice suit will formally begin with the iling of a \npetition with the court and service (i.e., delivery to the doctor/\ndefendant or his/her authorized representative) of the initiat-\ning legal pleading.\nComplaint.

For example, a cause of action \nmay be barred by the applicable statute of limitations. This \nafirmative defense claims that the lawsuit has not been \niled within the time limit provided by state law.\n3. The answer may seek relief against the patient/plaintiff by \nasserting what is referred to as a counterclaim. A counter-\nclaim is a claim being redirected back against the patient/\nplaintiff. Typically, this occurs when the patient has failed \nto pay for their services and has in turn sued for \nmalpractice.\nThe doctor/defendant should always be consulted by their \nattorney before iling of an answer. Any allegations admitted \nin the answer are established as a matter of law (i.e., the \ninformation may be used at trial). As a consequence, the \ndoctor/defendant should speciically approve the proposed \nanswer before it is served on the patient/plaintiff’s attorney \nand carefully review any proposed admissions. In general, \nthese admissions may not be withdrawn during the litigation \nprocess or trial and are binding on the doctor/defendant.\nIn the event that a response is not iled on behalf of the \ndoctor/defendant in a timely fashion, a default may be entered \nby the plaintiff’s counsel. The effect of a default is the doctor/\ndefendant admits to the allegations in the complaint and \nagrees to the relief (inancial claim) requested by the patient/\nplaintiff. Unless the default is set aside by the court (reversed), \nthe only issue at trial will be to determine the amount of the \npatient/plaintiff’s damages.\nMiscellaneous Presuit Recommendations\nDiscussing the Claim. Upon receiving a notice letter, a \ndoctor/defendant may attempt to discuss the situation with \nother colleagues to obtain their opinions. If a lawsuit is initi-\nated, the doctor/defendant may be asked to recount the con-\nversations, even if they are unfavorable to the defense of the \ncase. It is highly recommended that the doctor/defendant \nhave no discussion of the case with anyone other than their \nattorney or insurance carrier.\nDo Not Attempt to Communicate With Patient/Plaintiff \nLawyer. Attempting to contact the patient/plaintiff or their \nattorney is not recommended. Often, the doctor/defendant \nmay feel the need to plead their case and dissuade a dis-\ngruntled patient or attorney from continuing legal action. \nHowever, this is almost always futile and may have signiicant \nnegative ramiications. Another common error made by the \ndoctor/defendant is to offer the patient a refund in lieu of the \niling of the lawsuit. Although generally inadmissible (i.e., \ncannot be used against the doctor/defendant in court) in any \nsubsequent court proceeding, at the very least it creates the \nappearance that the doctor/defendant may be guilty of \nwrongdoing.\nCalling Subsequent Providers. Similarly, contacting subse-\nquent treating doctors is not recommended. If a case is \nbrought against a doctor, records of all subsequent treating \nproviders will be easily obtained through the discovery \njurisdiction of the court and basis for the requested relief (i.e., \nnegligence). The complaint includes a concise statement of \nthe claim, the relief (compensation) and remedies (damages \nand restitution) requested by the patient (referred to as the \n“plaintiff”), and a demand for judgment. The complaint \nusually will contain allegations of facts, which, if proven, \nentitle the patient/plaintiff to the damages they are seeking. \nOften the allegations within the complaint are very brief and \ngeneralized and may omit important, pertinent information \n(Fig. 19.6).\nService of Process. If a lawsuit is iled, the doctor/defendant \nshould notify their counsel and request that their attorney \ncontact the lawyer for the patient/plaintiff and arrange for \nacceptance of service of process (usually by receipt of a \nsummons and complaint). Defense counsel should offer to \naccept service on behalf of doctor/defendant or offer to \nschedule a time for service. This alleviates the stress and \nembarrassment of a sheriff or process server appearing in the \ndoctor’s waiting room to serve papers in the presence of the \ndoctor’s patients. Most plaintiff attorney irms will comply \nwith this request.\nSummons. The doctor/defendant, or in the alternative, their \ncounsel, will be served with the complaint together with a \nlegal document called a summons. The summons is the docu-\nment that notiies the doctor/defendant a legal action has \nbeen iled. The summons will include the name of the case, \nlocation of the court, and the name and address of the attor-\nney for the patient/plaintiff. It will also inform the doctor/\ndefendant of the deadline for responding to the complaint.\nIt is imperative that upon receipt of the summons and \ncomplaint, the doctor/defendant immediately contact their \ndefense attorney and provide their attorney with a copy of the \nsummons and complaint, along with any attached exhibits. In \nthe event the doctor/defendant has had no prior notice of the \nimpending legal action or has not been appointed insurance \ndefense counsel, they should immediately contact the profes-\nsional liability carrier and provide the insurance carrier with \ncopies of the documents provided. The fact that counsel has \nnot been appointed by the insurance carrier does not change \nthe time for responding to the complaint (Fig. 19.7).\nResponse to the Complaint. The doctor/defendant’s counsel \nwill need to ile a response to the complaint. This response \nmay take a number of forms depending on the legal sufi-\nciency of the complaint. A typical response is in the form of \na pleading (i.e., formal statement presenting legal documents \nor arguments) known as the answer. The answer iled on \nbehalf of the doctor/defendant serves three functions:\n1. It is a response to each of the individual allegations of the \ncomplaint. Each allegation will be either admitted or \ndenied or will state that the doctor/defendant is without \nknowledge of the speciic assertion.\n2. It will contain any afirmative defenses that the doctor/\ndefendant is interposing to any cause of action alleged in \nthe complaint. An afirmative defense is a legal reason why"

Similar to admissions made in response to \nthe complaint, interrogatory answers may not be withdrawn \nduring the litigation process or trial and are binding (i.e., \ncannot be withdrawn) by the defendant/doctor.\nInterrogatories are most effectively directed to the issue of \ndamages, including any expenses (i.e., medical and dental \nbills) the plaintiff/patient contends were incurred as a result \nof the alleged negligence by the doctor/defendant (Fig. 19.8).\nRequests for Disclosure. Requests for disclosure are statu-\ntorily (i.e., governed by law) predetermined requests for infor-\nmation that must be produced without objection by either \nplaintiff or defendant. Disclosures cover basic information \nthat is involved in a lawsuit, which includes witnesses, experts, \ncontentions of the parties, damages incurred, and the identity \nof any health care providers that treated the plaintiff.\nProduction of Documents and Things. This form of discov-\nery allows either party the opportunity to obtain for evalua-\ntion and/or copying documents, records, bills and other \nmaterials. The production of these documents is not without \nlimitation. The materials requested must be somehow rele-\nvant to the case or potentially applicable to the pending \naction (Fig. 19.9).\nRequest for Admissions. In a request for admission, the \nparty served is required to admit or deny or state that the party \nlacks suficient information to respond, concerning certain \nfacts and contentions of the case. If a responding party gives \nlack of information or knowledge as a reason for a failure to \nadmit all or part of a request for admission, that party shall \nstate in the answer that a reasonable inquiry concerning the \nmatter in the particular request has been made and that the \ninformation known or readily obtainable is insuficient to \nenable that party to admit the matter. The purpose of requests \nfor admissions is to eliminate unnecessary proof of undis-\nputed facts at trial. Extreme care must be taken in responding \nto requests for admissions. A request that has been admitted \nmay be presented (i.e., read) by the opposing attorney to the \njury during trial and may establish the matter(s) admitted. \nThese requests are usually time sensitive, and failure to respond \nin a timely manner will result in admissions being deemed \nagainst the party served (Fig. 19.10).\nExpert Reports. An expert report is a report written by \neither side’s medical expert stating their facts and indings \nwithin the case. The use of expert reports varies greatly \namong states. In some states, either party may request the \nexpert’s opinion and the basis for their opinions. However, in \nsome states, written expert reports are not required for the \niling of a lawsuit (Fig. 19.11).\nDepositions. The last and possibly the most important form \nof discovery is the deposition. A deposition is a formal \nquestion-and-answer session in which the attorney is given \nthe opportunity to ask questions of the opposing party under \nprocess. Calling the subsequent treating provider may poten-\ntially result in an uncomfortable situation wherein the sub-\nsequent treating doctor may request that the implant clinician \ntake inancial responsibility for the patient’s subsequent \nmedical needs, no matter how open ended. In turn, the sub-\nsequent treating provider may promise to encourage the \npatient to drop any legal claims. However, the payment of \nremedial medical/dental expenses is rarely successful in per-\nsuading a patient to drop their legal claims.\nSecure All Records. The original chart, radiographs, study \ncasts, surgical templates, laboratory prescriptions, pharmacy \nprescriptions, appointment logs, and any other documents or \nmaterials relating to the patient’s care should be secured and \ncopies placed in a safe location (e.g., doctor’s home or safe \ndeposit box). Although only a remote possibility, computer \nfailures do occur (sometimes without effective backup), as \nwell as ires, loods, or other catastrophes, resulting in the \npermanent loss the patient’s records.\nUninsured Defendant. In most states, medical practitioners \nare required to secure active malpractice insurance. The fact \nthat a doctor does not have malpractice insurance to cover a \nspeciic claim does not mean that the doctor cannot be sued. \nIf doctor/defendant is not insured, it is imperative they retain \ncounsel to represent their interests. The old adage is “a person \nwho acts as their own lawyer has a fool for a client” applies \nwith equal force to health care professionals, including \ndoctors. Having no, or inadequate, legal counsel may be dev-\nastating to the defense of an otherwise defensible lawsuit.\nLITIGATION PROCESS PART 2\nDISCOVERY PHASE\nThe second phase of the litigation process is known as the \ndiscovery phase.

Because of the advanced bone loss, Dr. Jones should have provided Ms. Smith the option of soft and \nhard (bone) tissue grafting prior to implant placement.   \n2.\nFailing to diagnosis and understand the complexity of Ms. Smith’s condition and failure to refer her to a \nspecialist for evaluation and treatment of soft and hard tissue grafting. \n3.\nFailing to utilize a radiopaque template during the cone beam computerized tomographic examination. A \nradiopaque template would have shown the exact location of the final prosthesis in reference to the \nanatomic contours of the mandibular bone and the intended implant sites. \n4.\nDuring the surgical placement of the implants, failing to utilize a surgical template which would have \nallowed for the ideal and proper placement of the implants with respect to the bony anatomy. This would \nhave allowed the implants to be placed in a more favorable position with respect to the available bone \npresent (buccal-lingual orientation) and soft tissue present. \n5.\nNot recognizing the lack or absence of attached tissue in the anterior mandible. Compounding this situation \nis the poor placement of the implants, which resulted in the implants being positioned in movable mucosa \n(nonattached tissue).  \n6.\nBecause of the positioning of the five implants, corrective surgery including the removal of the implants \nwill place Ms. Smith at great risk of further complications.  Due to the lack of bone and the perforation of \nthe lingual mandibular cortex, removal of the implants will most likely result in a mandibular fracture and \nloss of bone.\n7.\nI am familiar with and perform the same procedures that were completed by Dr. Jones on Ms. Smith. I am \nfamiliar with the fees charged by similar practitioners for the services rendered by Dr. Jones. I have \nreviewed the annual Fee Survey for the specific procedures in this region of the country and Dr. Jones fees \nfor these procedures were unreasonable and highly inappropriate. \n \n \n \n \n \nIn summary, as a direct and proximate result of the negligence and carelessness of Dr. Jones’ treatment of \nMs. Smith, the patient has suffered significant pain and suffering, embarrassment, undue stress, and significant \nmedical expenses.  Additionally, because of Dr. Jones’ improper treatment, Ms. Smith is in a very unfortunate \nposition as there exists no ideal remediation treatment to decrease the chronic pain and soreness from the poor \nimplant placement and lack of attached tissue.  Ms. Smith will most likely incur continuous dental appointments and \nrelated expenses indefinitely. \n  \nI believe the pretreatment, intraoperative procedures, and the postoperative care rendered by Dr. Jones\nfor Ms. Smith falls well below the standard of care.  All opinions rendered here and above are to a reasonable degree \nof professional certainty.  If additional records become available, I reserve the right to add/amend with further \nfinding of facts."

Once a question is answered in a deposition, it is \ndificult to contradict the testimony at a later date. A seasoned \nattorney will readily identify the contradiction and “impeach” \n(i.e., discredit the witness) the testimony. Therefore, whatever \nis stated in deposition cannot be easily amended or changed \nduring trial. Preparation for a deposition should occur in the \ndays or weeks prior to the date of the actual deposition.\nPreparation for the Deposition\nThe doctor/defendant should meet with their counsel and \ndiscuss the case in its entirety prior to the deposition. They \nshould be fully aware of the allegations of the claim, the \nalleged damages, speciic dates, and the issues of potential \nliability.\nAt the predeposition conference, the doctor/defendant \nshould be intimately familiar with their care and treatment \nof the patient, their justiication for the treatment provided, \nas well all written dental charting, and the billing ledger. The \ndoctor/defendant should ensure that the dental charting \nmatches the billing ledger or be prepared to explain any dis-\ncrepancies. The chart should be organized in such a fashion \nas to allow the doctor/defendant to easily ind the various \nitems contained therein.\nThe objective of the conference is to prepare the doctor/\ndefendant to testify at deposition. The deposition is under \noath, and the doctor will be expected to tell the truth. In some \njurisdictions the deposition may be videotaped. Often it is \nnot what is said but how it is said that matters most.\nIf the radiographs are digital, photographic quality prints \nshould be made available to the attorney for use during the \ndeposition, if necessary. Poor-quality or copied radiographs \noften result in possible incorrect testimony and will often be \nconfusing to the jury (Box 19.2).\nThe doctor/defendant should ask their attorney to provide \nthem with a copy of any depositions taken by the patient’s \nattorney. This is particularly important if the doctor has \nnever been deposed before. Although it would be advanta-\ngeous to have a transcript from a similar case, it is not impera-\ntive. The purpose of reviewing such a transcript is for the \ndoctor/defendant to become familiar with the process and to \nobtain an idea of the attorney’s general deposition procedure. \nTrial attorneys are generally creatures of habit, and the \nroadmap they follow in deposition is the same or similar from \ncase to case. Additionally, this will give the doctor an idea of \nthe dental acuity of their opponent. Many plaintiff attorneys \nhave limited knowledge with respect to dental procedures and \ncomplications. Do not, however, sell your adversary short; \nmost jurisdictions now have lawyers who are very seasoned \nin handling dental malpractice actions.\nDoctor/Defendant Testimony at Deposition. On the day of \nthe deposition the defendant should dress professionally, \narrive promptly, and be cooperative.

In some cases the patient may \nBOX 19.2 Recommendations/Ground \nRules for a Deposition\n• The doctor should be well prepared and have a complete \nknowledge of the records.\n• Answer only what is asked, do not volunteer information.\n• If you do not understand the question, answer as such.\n• Keep your answers short, responsive, and to the point.\n• Answer the question only after the attorney is done \nasking it.\n• Do not attempt to convince the attorney that you are right \nand that he or she and his or her client are wrong.\n• If an objection is made by your attorney, do not answer \nunless instructed to do so by your counsel.\n• Feel free to look at the chart/records and radiographs—it \nis not a memory test.\n• If you are shown radiographs and need a light box to view \nthem, advise that one is necessary.\n• Do not comment on radiographs that are inadequate or \npoor copies.\n• Do not guess or speculate on questions.\n• If you don’t know, answer as such.\n• Do not discuss any conversations or emails you had with \nyour counsel.\n• Be careful not to state that an author, text, or an expert is \nauthoritative. This places the practitioner at risk because if \nsome component of the treatment rendered differs from \nwhat has been written, the practitioner may be impeached \nby anything the author or expert states.\n• Always follow your attorney’s recommendations or sug-\ngestion because they are required to represent your best \ninterests.\n• Do not become argumentative or adversarial with the \nopposing attorney.\nappear in person to witness the doctor’s testimony; however, \nthere should be no communication with the patient. The \npatient may not ask questions and is not permitted to inter-\nfere with the doctor’s testimony. The doctor/defendant cannot \ncharge for their time at deposition, and expenses (e.g., court \nreporter, videographer) are usually covered by the patient/\nplaintiff’s attorney.\nPatient/Plaintiff Testimony at Deposition. Just as the \npatient/plaintiff is entitled to take the doctor’s deposition, the \ndoctor/defendant counsel has the right to depose the patient. \nAs with all depositions the doctor/defendant has the legal \nright to appear at the deposition. The doctor may provide \nquestions to their counsel and may discuss the testimony but \nmay not interfere with or disrupt the process. All expenses for \nthe patient/plaintiff’s deposition are covered by the doctor/\ndefendant’s malpractice carrier.\nIf the doctor/defendant elects to attend a treating doctor \nor expert’s deposition, they should do the following:\n1. Do not arrive before your attorney and attempt to \nengage the witness in conversation, whether related to \nthe case or not.\n2. Be polite and introduce yourself to the plaintiff’s \nattorney."

    "content": "845\nCHAPTER 19 Medicolegal Aspects of Implant Dentistry\nPretrial Modes of Disposition\nIf a lawsuit is resolved before trial, the resolution is accom-\nplished by one of the following methods8:\nMotion for Summary Judgment. A summary judgment is a \nmotion by either party that asserts that all factual issues in \nthe case are settled, therefore there is no need for a trial. The \nmotion is supported by afidavits, depositions under oath, \nand admissions of fact, as well as a legal argument. This \nmotion has the following components:\nFacts: the party initiating the motion will present its version \nof the facts.\nLaw: a memorandum discussing the statutes that govern \nthe case.\nSummary: the party will summarize and anticipate the \nopposing counsel’s arguments and will explain why those \narguments are not valid.\nOpposing Party Response: the opposing counsel will respond \nto the information contained within the summary \njudgment.\nJudge’s Decision: the judge will review the motion and \nresponses and will either grant (agree) the motion or deny \nthe motion.\nIn a dental malpractice suit, this motion is usually iled \nby the defense to test the patient/plaintiff’s ability to \nobtain an expert witness that can establish negligence and \nproximate cause.\nMotion to Dismiss. Typically, a motion to dismiss is iled in \nlieu of an answer to test the legal suficiency of the plaintiff’s \ncomplaint. Matters typically raised in a motion to dismiss \ninclude adequacy of the facts alleged. For purposes of motion \nto dismiss, all well-pleaded allegations of the complaint are \naccepted as true. In such circumstances the plaintiff will gen-\nerally be given the opportunity to correct the defect and \nproceed. A motion to dismiss may also be iled when the \nplaintiff cannot produce a qualiied expert witness that can \nestablish negligence and proximate cause. The time period is \ngoverned by statutes with each state. (e.g., Texas = 180 days). \nMost statutes will provide the plaintiff an extension to comply \nwith the provision.\nVoluntary Nonsuit. In some situations the patient/plaintiff \nmay elect to drop the lawsuit against the doctor/defendant. \nThis is most commonly done to simplify and narrow the case \nwhen there are multiple doctor/defendants named in the \nlawsuit. However, the voluntarily dismissed claim may be \nresubmitted if the statute of limitations period has not expired.\nSettlement. When the plaintiff and defendant parties agree \nto settle the lawsuit prior to a trial, a settlement agreement \nwill be iled. This agreement will usually contain language \nstating that the doctor/defendant does not admit negligence \nand the settlement agreement is agreed upon to avoid the \ntime, cost, and harassment of defending a lawsuit. Both parties \nwill then mutually execute an agreed motion for nonsuit to \nbe iled in court, which will be granted by the judge.\n3. Do not interfere in any way with counsel’s questioning. \nIf you believe information needs to be addressed by \nyour attorney, write the information on a notepad and \nwait till a break occurs to discuss.\nMediation\nPrior to the 1990s, mediations were essentially nonexistent. \nSettlements typically occurred based on telephone conversa-\ntions between opposing counsel, similar to the manner in \nwhich settlements occurred in routine personal injury claims. \nAs liability insurance companies became more and more con-\ncerned about attorney fees associated with the defense of \nmedical malpractice claims, mediation became more preva-\nlent. In recent years, when settlements of medical malpractice \nclaims occur, the majority of them do so at mediation \nconferences.\nIn most jurisdictions a mediation conference is required \nprior to trial. Mediation is a nonbinding alternative dispute \nresolution process. With time, it was found that cases often \nsettled on the proverbial “courthouse steps.” In an effort to \nfacilitate the settlement process and encourage discussion \nprior to the day of trial, the mediation process was \ndeveloped.\nMediation involves a potential settlement process in which \na third party (mediator) attempts to ind points of agreement \nand to resolve conlicted issues. Usually the mediator (typi-\ncally an attorney or retired judge) is agreed upon by both \nsides or appointed by the trial court. The mediator has been \neducated and trained in the art of opening dialogue and \naddressing contested issues with the goal of resolving the case \nand putting an end to the litigation process. The mediation \nconference is strictly conidential, and concessions or resolu-\ntions are inadmissible in a court hearing. In most cases the \ndoctor/defendant will be required to attend. The doctor/\ndefendant should be prepared to provide guidance to their \nattorney concerning claims and allegations that are made in \nthe conference. The doctor may be asked either at the time of \nthe conference or shortly before to consent to a potential \nsettlement. In most instances the doctor/defendant must \nconsent to an agreement in mediation.\nA potential tactic that mediators use is to provide a “medi-\nator number” at the conclusion of the mediation conference \nif the mediator believes the case should be settled but the \nparties cannot reach an agreed-upon amount. The mediator \nprovides a settlement igure on a piece of paper, providing \neach party with the opportunity to say “yes” or “no” to the \nsuggested number. The mediator does so after conclusion of \nthe mediation conference, providing a deadline for the parties \nto say “yes” or “no.” The parties are told to return the sheet \nof paper indicating their response within a certain timeframe. \nIf the parties agree to the proposed settlement igure, the \nmediator notiies the parties of the settlement. After agree-\nment, the mediation settlement is a binding agreement. When \nboth parties sign the agreement, neither party can deviate \nfrom the mediation settlement agreement. The patient/\nplaintiff basically agrees to waive their right to sue the doctor/\ndefendant in exchange for compensation."

    "content": "846\nCHAPTER 19 Medicolegal Aspects of Implant Dentistry\nSettling a Lawsuit\nRamiication of Settling a Malpractice Case. The doctor/\ndefendant is often confronted with the dificult question of \nwhether to settle the lawsuit or continue to litigate with the \npossibility of a trial. Studies show that over 70% of cases \ndecided by judge or jury are resolved in favor of the defendant \ndoctor.9 Many doctors look at this statistic and believe their \nchances are very good. However, this statistic is misleading \nbecause most of the strongest cases against doctor/defendants \nare settled out of court, prior to a trial.\nWhether the doctor/defendant agrees to settlement or \nsuffers an adverse verdict at trial, the doctor may be subject \nto a number of possible adverse consequences:\n1. The trial may be personally humiliating to the doctor and \ntheir practice. In some cases the local newspaper or televi-\nsion station have covered the trial result and even have \npublished the names involved.\n2. The malpractice carrier is compelled by law to report the \nsettlement to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) \nand the state dental board.\n3. The state licensing division may open a disciplinary inves-\ntigation against the dentist’s license, and sanctions and \nines may be implemented.\n4. If the doctor has clinical privileges at a hospital or ambula-\ntory surgical centers, the malpractice carrier is compelled \nto report such settlements, which may affect the doctor/\ndefendant’s privileges.\n5. If the doctor participates with dental insurance plans, the \ndoctor/defendant’s contract may require them to report \nthe settlement to these plans, which may affect the status \nof participation.\n6. If the doctor/defendant is board certiied in a dental spe-\ncialty, the doctor/defendant may be required to report the \naction to the specialty board, which may affect the doctor’s \ncertiication.\nConsent to Settle Policy. Most doctor/defendants do not \nknow what their rights are when it comes to making a deci-\nsion on a proposed settlement. Each malpractice policy has a \n“consent to settle” provision, which sets forth the rights, \nduties, and obligations of both the insurer and the insured \nwith regard to settlement of a claim. Usually, a consent to \nsettle clause will require the insurance company to obtain the \ndoctor/defendant’s approval before settling any claim. It is \nrecommended that every doctor check this in their policy \nbecause some provisions will give authority regarding settle-\nment back to the insurance company. Examples include10:\nHammer Clause: A hammer clause will entitle the insurance \ncompany to be only responsible for the amount of a claim \nthat has been “settled,” even though the doctor/defendant \ndoes not consent. For example, if the insurance company \nnegotiates a settlement of $100,000 and the doctor does \nnot give consent for settlement, the doctor would be \nresponsible for any monies paid on a claim over $100,000, \nplus attorney fees.\nUnreasonable Provision: This clause will override the doctor’s \nconsent authority if the insurance company determines \nthe doctor is unreasonable in withholding consent. The \ninsurance company may settle the case without the doc-\ntor’s permission.\nBoard Approval Provision: With a board approval provision, \nthe insurance company’s review board has the ability to \noverride the doctor/defendant’s wishes if they agree that \nthe doctor’s actions deviated from the standard of care.\nBinding Arbitration: In some insurance policies, if the insur-\nance company disagrees with the doctor’s refusal to \nconsent to settlement, the case must be sent to binding \narbitration. Binding arbitration is when the dispute is \ngiven to an unbiased third party to resolve and their deci-\nsion is agreed upon by both parties as inal or binding.\nNo Active Insurance: If the doctor no longer owns an active \nmalpractice policy with the carrier, this provision causes \nthe doctor/defendant to lose their ability to withhold \nconsent to settlement.\nLicense Revoked/Deceased: with these provisions, if the doctor \nhas their license revoked or is deceased, the consent for \nsettlement provision is deemed null and void.\nPotential \nNonsettlement \nRamiications. The \ndoctor/\ndefendant should be fully aware of the ramiications of a \nrefusal to settle. The hammer clause, also known as the “nuclear \noption,” will sometimes force a doctor/dependent to settle the \nlawsuit. If the doctor/defendant refuses to settle pursuant to \nthe insurance policy, the insurer’s liability for the claim will not \nbe greater than the amount for which they could have settled \nthe claim. Further, the defendant may be liable for the defense \ncosts, including attorney’s fees, following a refusal to settle. \nWhile the defendant/doctor may feel strongly about their posi-\ntion, proceeding to trial is not without potential consequences. \nConfronted with this situation, it is highly recommended that \nthe doctor/defendant seek personal council for advice.\nLITIGATION PROCESS PART 3\nMALPRACTICE TRIAL\nWhen all attempts to resolve the dispute have been futile, the \ninal option for resolution is a trial. Dental malpractice law-\nsuits rarely end in a trial. Statistics show that approximately \n7% of malpractice suits are decided by a jury.11 In the event \nthat settlement negotiations fail and the doctor/defendant is \nunable to have the matter thrown out by the court on legal \ngrounds, the matter will proceed to trial. A malpractice trial \nmay be described as a “theater with rules.”\nThe doctor/defendant should ensure they are fully pre-\npared for trial. This should involve meeting with their attor-\nney a minimum of 1 week before trial to discuss the process \nand to rehearse their testimony. The defendant/doctor should \nhave a complete set of their dental records and be intimately \nfamiliar with the chart’s contents. The defendant/doctor \nshould be able to easily identify and acquire any document, \nradiograph, scan, or study cast being discussed. Being disor-\nganized in front of a jury is troublesome because it gives the \nappearance of “sloppiness.”"

The trial duration is usually \ndependent on the complexity of the malpractice case. \nAlthough attendance of the doctor/defendant is not manda-\ntory, absence is not recommended because it gives a negative \nconnotation in the eyes of the jury.\nCourt Docket\nThe exact date and time a trial will commence is often not clearly \ndeined. The court usually places the trial on a “docket,” which \nis a range of time that the court may call for the start of the trial. \nThis may happen with as little as 24-hours notice. The doctor/\ndefendant must be prepared to change their schedule and devote \nthe time necessary for trial. The scheduling of the trial, which \nincludes coordinating all witnesses, attorneys, judge, and jurors, \nis not always easy and often conlicts exist (Fig. 19.12).\nContinuance\nIn American procedural court law, a continuance is a post-\nponement of the trial at the request of either or both the \ndefendant and plaintiff or the judge. A motion for continuance \nis usually granted when there is reasonable cause. In some \nstates “fast-track” rules limit the ability of judges to grant con-\ntinuances. There exist many reasons for a continuance:\n1. Inadequate time to prepare\n2. Conlicting obligations of counsel\n3. Illness of any of the involved\n4. Expert witness conlict\n5. An agreement between the parties\n6. Religious holidays\nCivil Courtroom Layout\nThe courtroom layout for a civil malpractice trial includes \n(Fig. 19.13):\nJudge’s bench: the presiding judge will sit behind a raised \ndesk, known as the bench.\nWitness stand: adjacent to the judge’s bench is the witness \nstand in which the various witnesses will present their \ntestimony.\nCourt reporter: the court reporter usually will sit in front of \nthe judge’s bench and is responsible for recording verba-\ntim all testimony, objections, and judge’s rulings.\nJudge’s clerk: the clerk is located in front of or to the side of \nthe judge’s bench and will usually administer the oath to \njurors and witnesses. The clerk is also in charge of all \nphysical exhibits that are introduced into evidence.\nBailiff: the bailiff has many duties including calling the wit-\nnesses, being in charge of the jury, and acting as the liaison \nbetween the judge and jury.\nCouncil tables: in front of the court reporter table, two tables \n(plaintiff and defense) will be present for the plaintiff and \ndefendant and attorneys.\nJury box: on the far side of the courtroom will be the jury \nbox, where the jury will sit while testimony is given.\nJury Selection\nThe irst step in the trial process is the jury selection. Also \nreferred to as voir dire. Voir dire is a Latin phrase that literally \nmeans “to say what is true, what is objectively accurate or \nsubjectively honest.” A group of potential jurors are sum-\nmoned to the courthouse to be questioned by the lawyers and \njudge to determine their suitability for jury service. The \npotential jurors may also be required to complete a question-\nnaire. The jury pool is usually selected from the voter registra-\ntion list or from the driver’s license registrations in most \njurisdictions. The attorneys on both sides are given an oppor-\ntunity to question the prospective jurors about their back-\ngrounds to determine if they have any biases or prejudices \nthat would prevent them from being fair and impartial to \neither side. During voir dire process, lawyers strive to achieve \nfour major goals in evaluating the jury candidates: (1) elicit-\ning information from each potential juror, (2) developing a \nrapport with the potential juror, (3) educating potential \njurors on the process, and (4) attempting to educate potential \njurors concerning their case.\nAfter questioning is completed, the selection process \nbegins. The court will take into consideration what is referred \nto as challenges for cause. The court will be asked to “strike” \n(i.e., remove) any potential juror who has indicated they \ncannot be fair and impartial or who is otherwise unit to serve \nas a juror on that case. An example of unitness is being a \nconvicted felon. Once the for-cause challenges have been \naddressed, each side is given a certain number of “peremptory \nchallenges.” A peremptory challenge allows attorneys to \ndismiss a prospective juror for any reason they deem neces-\nsary. These challenges are used by each side to eliminate \npotential jurors who would be otherwise qualiied. After these \npotential jurors are removed from the pool, those who remain \nwill become the jury. The rules in each state are different, with \nthe jury panel usually comprising from 6 to 12 jurors. In most \nstates, one or more alternate jurors may be selected. Alternate \njurors will attend trial and are called on to replace a juror who \nis unable to complete their jury service (e.g., for health \nreasons).\nOpening Statement\nOnce the juror panel is selected and sworn in, the plaintiff \nand defense attorneys for both sides are asked to give an \nopening statement. The plaintiff’s attorney will be irst to give \ntheir opening statement, followed by the defense attorney. \nThe opening statement is an overview or roadmap of what \neach side intends on proving and explaining to the jury what \nthey can expect from each of the witnesses. Attention should \nbe paid to the opening statements because the opponent’s \nclaims will be discussed in detail. It is bad practice to assert \nthat you intend on proving a particular fact and claim and \nthen not doing so.\nPatient/Plaintiff Case Presentation\nUpon completion of the opening statements, the patient/\nplaintiff will begin their case. The patient/plaintiff presents \ntheir case in the hopes of proving that the doctor/defendant"

It merely means that the witness pos-\nsesses specialized training and education (dental school edu-\ncation at a minimum) on a topic at issue and will be able to \naid the inder of fact (jury) in making its determination of \nthe ultimate issues.\nSpecially retained experts are the so-called “hired guns.” \nThey are paid to review all the documents with respect to the \ncase and testify during trial. Because “experts” are witnesses \nfor hire, the credibility of a specially retained expert is always \nan issue, and the jury is free to believe or not believe the \ntestimony of any witness, including a specially retained \nexpert.\nSubsequent treating doctors tend to be more troublesome \nwhen they provide opinion or expert testimony. Unlike the \nhired guns, they are not handpicked like specially retained \nexperts, and they usually testify on the basis of their clinical \nevaluation of the patient/plaintiff. They are also not generally \npaid a fee for their “expert witness” testimony. Most com-\nmonly, these witnesses will be attacked on the basis that they \nare testifying on behalf of a patient who remains under their \ncare. Additionally, a subsequent treating dentist must defend \ntheir own conduct. For example, if the subsequent treating \ndentist has removed all or part of the dental work delivered \nto the patient by the doctor/defendant, the subsequent \ndeviated from the standard of care. The plaintiff attorney \nmust prove each and every legal aspect of their claim. If each \nelement is not proven, the court may take the case away from \nthe jury and enter a judgment (defendant verdict) in favor of \nthe doctor/defendant.\nThe term standard of care is often used and rarely under-\nstood. Unfortunately, there exists no universal deinition. The \njury, in some jurisdictions, will be instructed that the stan-\ndard of care means what “a similar practitioner would do \nunder the same or similar circumstances.” In other states, \nincluding Florida, the jury will be instructed that the standard \nof care is “reasonable and appropriate care.” This does not \nmean perfect care, nor does it mean what another practitio-\nner would have done.\nThe mere occurrence of a bad outcome or result does not \nentitle the patient/plaintiff to a verdict in their favor (i.e., \nfailed dental implant). The tort system in this country is fault \nbased; some fault or deviation from the standard of care must \nbe proven by the patient/plaintiff in order for them to prove \ntheir claim.\nProof of a deviation from the standard of care is usually \naccomplished through an expert witness or, on occasion, via \na subsequent treating doctor. The term expert is likewise fre-\nquently used in the litigation process but is similarly not well \nunderstood by doctors or lawyers.

Usually, \nwith respect to standard of care, the most compelling evi-\ndence is from the expert witnesses. Expert witnesses can be \ngeneral dentists, specialists, or other health care professionals. \nIn some states, the expert is required to have training identical \nto or greater than that of the defendant (e.g., Arizona). The \njury will evaluate the information provided by the expert \nwitness to determine their credibility and knowledge con-\ncerning the subject.\nThere are two types of expert witnesses, nonretained and \nretained. Nonretained are usually subsequent care providers \nwho have expressed criticism and testify on the injuries \ninvolved in the defendant’s treatment.13 Retained expert wit-\nnesses are witnesses who have not necessarily seen the patient \nfor treatment but are hired by the attorney for their opinions \non standard of care and causation by reviewing the records.14 \nIn most cases, the doctor/defendant may request their expert \nwitness for testimony on their behalf.\nImpeachment\nThe doctor/defendant should have a copy of all discovery, \nincluding their deposition, answers to interrogatories, and \nrequests for admissions. The doctor should be fully prepared \nto discuss in detail each of these items, including their deposi-\ntion testimony. If, during testimony, the doctor/defendant \ncontradicts themselves, they may be subject to “impeach-\nment” by the inconsistent statement. This is a process whereby \nthe opposing attorney is able to bring the inconsistency to the \nattention of the jury. It is an unpleasant event and is very \nembarrassing. The more times a witness is “impeached,” the \nmore the witness loses credibility with the jury. It is impera-\ntive the doctor/defendant know exactly what was answered in \nall interrogatories and deposition testimony.\nInadmissible Information\nIn most states, peer review records and testimony regarding \npeer review activities are immune from discovery and are \ninadmissible (i.e., not allowed) as evidence in dental malprac-\ntice suits. Additionally, quality assurance committees, utiliza-\ntion committees, and incident and risk management reports \nalso are not discoverable or admissible. This information, \nwhich may include indings or retributions against the doctor/\ndefendant, may not be used against them in a malpractice \ncourt hearing.15\nClosing Arguments\nOnce both parties have completed presentation of their cases \neach will rest and closing arguments will commence with the \nplaintiff side going irst. The closing argument or summation \nis the inal opportunity for the attorneys to persuade the \njurors to ind in favor of their side. The facts will be sum-\nmarized to show their side has proven their case and to \npoint out the failures of the opponent’s claims and conten-\ntions. The attorneys may not discuss or comment about any \ninformation that was not presented during the course of the \ntrial; commentary is limited to the evidence presented. After \nthe defense presents their closing argument, the plaintiff’s \ntreating dentist must offer a valid reason for removing what \nis otherwise perfectly acceptable dental work. The subsequent \ntreating dentist is locked into testifying there was some dei-\nciency that necessitated the subsequent care and treatment, \nincluding the removal of the dental work. Otherwise, it is the \nsubsequent treating dentist, and not the defendant, who has \nsubjected the patient to unnecessary care and treatment.\nWitness Order\nThe general order of witnesses to be called to testify is left to \nthe discretion of the attorneys. Generally, the plaintiff attor-\nneys will select the doctor/defendant as the irst witness, the \ntreating doctors next, followed by witnesses to discuss \ndamages, the expert witness, with the patient/plaintiff gener-\nally going last. In some cases, the plaintiff’s attorneys may \nvary this plan by placing the plaintiff on the stand irst with \nthe doctor/defendant going last.\nThe doctor/defendant must be completely prepared to \ntestify, and their answers should be intelligently thought out, \ngiven in a concise manner consistent with the dental chart and \nthe prior testimony (i.e., deposition). A common pitfall for the \ndoctor/defendant is to argue with the opposing counsel, which \nnever results in a positive outcome. The questions should be \nanswered as phrased; however, further explanation may be \ngiven. At the very least it makes it appear that the attorney is \nnot allowing the doctor/defendant to tell the full story and not \ngiven the opportunity to expound on your response.\nOnce the plaintiff’s attorney has inished asking their \nquestions, the doctor/defendant’s attorney is given an oppor-\ntunity to question their own client. This is generally brief and \nis used as a means of clarifying the doctor’s testimony. The \ndoctor/defendant will be given an opportunity to testify a \nsecond time if their attorney deems it necessary to testify in \nthe defense side of the case. This is called cross-examination, \nor simply referred to as “cross.” On completion of the cross-\nexamination, the patient/plaintiff attorney is given one more \nopportunity to question the witness, which is referred to as a \nredirect. This inquiry is limited to areas covered in the \ncross-examination.\nAfter the plaintiff’s attorney has presented their case, they \nwill “rest,” and the defense will be given the opportunity to \npresent their case or move for dismissal. If the judge does not \ndismiss the case, the defense will call their witnesses, with the \nplaintiff’s attorney having the opportunity to cross-examine.\nFor a successful verdict against a doctor/defendant, the \nplaintiff’s attorney must prove there was a deviation from the \nstandard of care. However, they only need to prove evidence \nof probability (not necessarily a certainty) of a breach in the \nstandard of care. This is termed preponderance of evidence. \nThe legal deinition of probability means that, even if the jury \nhas 49% doubt that the plaintiff’s version of the facts is true, \nthey will still ind the doctor/defendant failed to meet the \nstandard of care.12\nExpert Witnesses\nIn a dental implant malpractice suit the jury is requested to \ndetermine if the doctor/defendant violated the standard of"

Special \ndamages are provided as compensation for inancial loss, \nsuch as medical bills, hotel and travel expenses, lost wages, or \nloss of future earning capacity.\nComparative Fault\nIf the patient is found to be negligent or to have caused or \ncontributed to the adverse event or complication (e.g., failure \nto take antibiotic, missed appointments), the award may be \nreduced or withdrawn. Such comparative fault reduces or \nextinguishes the award based on the percentage of patient’s \nfault. It behooves every practitioner to make detailed notes \non missed appointments, failed instructions, or a false or \ndeceptive history. In some states the doctrine of contributory \nnegligence is followed, which provides that if a patient is at \nfault to any degree, there can be no recovery and the malprac-\ntice claim is dismissed by the court.16\nPostverdict Adjustments\nIn many large verdict cases, upon judicial review, awards are \nreduced. Because the jury verdict must be ratiied by the trial \njudge in the form of a “judgment,” many judges will readjust \nthe damages if they appear excessive. A higher court may also \nreduce the award if they feel the evidence does not support \nthe full amount awarded. And lastly, the damages may be \nnegotiated between the plaintiff and defense teams. The \ndefense may threaten to appeal to a higher court, which could \noverturn the verdict or reduce the award. An appeal will \nincrease the plaintiff’s costs, which will result in many cases \nthe plaintiff accepting a lesser amount in settlement.\nExcess Verdict\nJury awards in liability cases are often unpredictable and may \nexceed the doctor/defendant’s liability coverage. Most doctors \ndo not realize they or their corporation are responsible for \nthe excess verdict amount (i.e., reward amount above the \nmaximum malpractice limits). For example, if the doctor has \na $1 million policy limit and a judgment against the doctor \nis $2.5 million, the doctor is responsible for the excess $1.5 \nmillion. For doctors concerned about excess verdicts, policy \nlimits may be raised to $3 million or $5 million. It is highly \nrecommended that if a doctor/defendant has a case that may \npotentially result in an excess verdict, personal counsel should \nbe retained to safeguard the interests of the defendant dentist.\nTypes of Malpractice Insurance\nOccurrence. Occurrence dental insurance is the most \npopular dental insurance carried by dental practitioners. This \ncoverage is based on when the actual dental treatment in \nquestion occurred, not when the claim is made. As long as \nthe incident in question is made during the active policy \nperiod, the malpractice carrier will adhere to the terms and \nconditions of the policy. For example, if a claim against an \ninsured doctor is made in 2015 for treatment rendered in \n2012 (i.e., while the policy was active), the malpractice carrier \nwill cover the claim. The occurrence policy offers permanent \ncoverage for incidents during the policy period.\nattorney is entitled to make a concluding argument or rebut-\ntal. This is the last opportunity for the plaintiff to discuss any \npoints made by the defense attorneys in their inal arguments. \nAt the conclusion of closing arguments, the judge will instruct \nthe jury as to the appropriate rules of the law that they must \nfollow in reaching a verdict.\nDeliberation\nAfter the inal arguments and instructions from the judge, the \njury will proceed to the jury room to begin the process of \ndeliberation. The jury will have all of the items and materials \nintroduced into evidence with them to consider in the delib-\nerations. Initially, a presiding juror will be elected to direct \nover discussions and voting. This juror is referred to as the \nforeperson. The bailiff will oversee the jurors and will be the \ngo-between between the judge and jury.\nIn the deliberation process the jury will attempt to reach \na decision on the outcome of the case. In most jurisdictions \na majority (i.e., over 50%) of the jurors must agree on a inal \nverdict; in some jurisdictions the verdict must be unanimous. \nDuring this process the jury may ask for the judge to explain \nor instruct them on certain aspects of the law. In some juris-\ndictions it is permissible for the jury to request that certain \naspects of the trial testimony be read back to them. Once the \njury reaches a decision, they will allocate and decide the \namount of the award of damages, if any. Damages may be \ncategorized as either economic, noneconomic, or punitive \n(damages awarded as punishment in excess of the actual \ndamages). The amount and availability of the various damages \nis dependent on state laws.\nVerdict\nAfter the jury decides on the inal verdict, the jury will \nnotify the bailiff, who will in turn notify the trial judge. All \nthe participants in the trial will then reconvene in the \ncourtroom for the announcement of the verdict. The judge \nwill usually read, or “publish,” the verdict in open court. If \nthe verdict is for the plaintiff, the jury will usually set forth \nthe amount the defendant must pay the plaintiff for \ndamages. The attorney for either side may ask for the jury \nto be polled. When the jury is polled, each juror will be \nasked if they agree with the decision announced. The losing \nparty has the right to appeal, in which they petition a \nhigher court to review various aspects of the case and trial \nwith the hope that the appellate court may ind fault with \ndecisions of the trial court and reverse the jury verdict. An \nappelate court, also know as an appeals court, reviews the \ndecisions and process of a lower court. Although damages \nare not paid until the appeal is heard by an appeals court \nand a inal ruling is completed, a bond may be required to \nsecure the verdict.\nDamages\nIf a doctor/defendant has breached the standard of care, the \npatient may be awarded by two types of damages: general or \nspecial. General damages are awarded for physical and emo-\ntional pain and suffering. The amount of the award is solely"

The NPDB was imple-\nmented in 1990, and it requires reporting of any licensure, \nhospital privileges, and professional society actions against \ndentists related to quality of care. Additionally, the NPDB \nmonitors and provides information on malpractice payments \nmade for all health care practitioners on settled malpractice \ncases. The information is not available to the general public \nand is only provided to hospitals, health care entities, and \nlicensing boards.\nIf a doctor is reported to the NPDB, the doctor is given \nthe opportunity to respond to the allegations of the reported \nincident. This statement is available on the NPDB website. \nAdditionally, there is a self-query service for health care pro-\nfessionals to view and request information about themselves \ncontained in the NPDB.\nState Dental Licensure Complaints\nComplaints against practitioners to state boards are on the \nrise in most states. Complaints against dentists to the state \nboard usually occur by two avenues. First, if money is paid to \na patient by an insurance company in resolution of a claim, \nthe malpractice carrier is in most circumstances obligated to \ninform the state board. This report often results in an inves-\ntigation by the state licensing board. Secondly, a patient may \nhave dificulty in obtaining legal representation in pursuing \ndental malpractice litigation against a dentist. Many attorneys \nwill not represent patients unless there is serious injury to the \npatient. With no other recourse, the patient iles a licensure \ncomplaint to the state licensing board.\nAfter the state board is informed or receives a complaint \nabout a licensed dentist, an investigation will follow. The \nprocedures to be followed will vary according to a particular \nstate’s public health code, dental practice act, or health \ndepartment administrative. It is highly recommended that \nthe practitioner be well versed on the processes and proce-\ndures for their own state.\nAdditionally, some states may require dentists to self-\nreport any convictions of crimes, which most likely will result \nin a board investigation. Most state legislatures have enacted \nlegislation that mandates the state dental board to investigate \nevery complaint (e.g., patient insurance carrier, self-reporting) \nasserted against a licensed dentist.\nThe investigation process usually begins with a request for \nrecords by the state board. In some situations, a records \nrequest is not the result of a complaint against the dentist but \ncould involve a complaint against another licensed practitio-\nner. When sending records, is it imperative to make a nota-\ntion of what records were sent and conirmation of their \ndelivery. Most states have dental investigators who will review \nthe requested records, radiographs, and other related docu-\nments and make a recommendation to the state board. If the \nClaims-Made. Claims-made insurance provides coverage \nwhen claims occur when both the alleged incident and result-\ning claim occur during period the policy is in force. Claims-\nmade policies provide coverage as long as the doctor continues \nto renew the initial policy and any subsequent renewals. Once \nthe doctor stops paying the premiums, the coverage stops. \nClaims brought against a doctor after the coverage ends will \nnot be covered, even if the incident occurred while the policy \nwas in force.\nFor claims-made policies, a “tail” coverage (extended \nreporting endorsement) must be purchased at the end of the \ntermination of the policy. This extended policy is needed \nupon retirement, taking a leave of absence from practice, \njoining a group practice with different insurance, or moving \nto a different state. Usually, malpractice carriers will offer free \ntail coverage in the event of death, disability, and retirement, \nprovided a certain age is reached. Tail coverage can be expen-\nsive, often three times the last premium paid by the \npractitioner.\nExtreme care must be used if a practitioner switches insur-\nance carriers with a claims-made policy. The new policy will \nnot generally cover conduct occurring prior to the date of the \nnew policy. Doctors should request “prior acts” coverage, \ncommonly referred to as “nose” coverage, to cover this poten-\ntial gap. Alternatively, the doctor may purchase prior acts \ncoverage from the new insurance company. This will cover \nany incidents which occur before the date on which the new \ncoverage begins.\nLimits of Malpractice Insurance\nA policy limit stipulates the maximum amount of compensa-\ntion an insurance company will cover upon the result of a \nclaim against a doctor. With an occurrence policy, a separate \nset of limits will be given for each year you purchase the \npolicy. The limits of the policy remain available to pay for \nfuture claims, which are based upon claims that occur during \nthat speciic policy period. With claims-made coverage, only \nthe current limits apply to pay for claims, which arise from \nthe previous years of practice. For example, a standard $1 \nmillion/$3 million policy limit will allow for $1 million avail-\nable to pay any single claim and $3 million total for the span \nof the policy period.\nEntity Coverage\nMost doctors do not realize that their practice entity may be \nnamed in a lawsuit along with themselves. If the doctor owns \ntheir own practice, there are two possible forms of coverage.\nSeparate Limits Coverage. With most insurers the practice \nmay be eligible for an entity malpractice policy with separate \nlimits of liability. This will allow for defense costs and indem-\nnity payments to be covered separately from the individual \npolicy limits.\nShared Limits Coverage. Doctors who own 100% of a \nsolo practice may combine their individual policy limits with \ntheir practice policy limits. Defense costs and indemnity"

    "content": "853\nCHAPTER 19 Medicolegal Aspects of Implant Dentistry\nNo practitioners can remember every interaction, phone \ncall, medication, conversation, and procedure involving every \npatient. In the event of a legal action, the practitioner will \nmost likely need to rely upon what has or has not been docu-\nmented, to some degree. In addition, in the litigation environ-\nment the practitioner’s expert is going to formulate their \nopinions based upon the available documents and records. \nThe expert should be able to read the documentation and \nunderstand what treatment has been performed, the clinical \nand radiographic basis for the care, and the treatment’s inal \noutcome. The age-old adage “if it’s not written it did not \nhappen” still holds true today. Conversely, it is dificult for a \npatient’s expert to contradict the documentation in a patient’s \nchart if the record is detailed and accurate both before and \nafter a complication arises. The logical inference is that a \npractitioner who keeps accurate records as a matter of course \nhas records that are more trustworthy.\nThe plaintiff’s attorney and expert will also scrutinize the \npatient’s records. If the records are poor, this may have a \nnegative effect on the implant clinician’s credibility. For \nexample, the plaintiff’s attorney and expert will explain to the \njury that the records are “sloppy” and a deviation from the \nstate board’s requirements. On the other hand, good records \nsuggest that appropriate time and care has been devoted to \nthe patient’s medical-dental needs.\nOne often-overlooked area of documentation is missed or \ncancelled appointments. It is crucial, particularly in cases \nwith complications, to note patient appointment failures or \ncancellations. It is dificult, if not impossible, to reconstruct \na history of missed or cancelled appointments years after they \noccur. This is especially important where the patient’s failure \nto keep appointments makes it more dificult for the dentist \nto monitor and treat a complication.\nAdditional information that is often overlooked and not \ndocumented includes:\n• Medical history updates\n• List of current medications\n• Medications prescribed (include name of pharmacy/\nphone number if called in)\n• Consultation referrals\n• Recommended posttreatment care\n• Postoperative instructions\n• Lack of patient compliance\nThe minimum content of progress notes/treatment notes is \ngenerally governed by the various state dental practice acts. \nHowever, some general principles apply to all such records that \nextend beyond the minimal requirements established by the \nstate boards. The SOAP format is a method of documentation \nrecommended for health care providers for progress notes in \nthe patient’s chart. The SOAP acronym has four components: \nsubjective, objective, assessment, and plan (Box 19.3).\nSubjective: includes the patient’s chief complaint and should \ninclude comments, desires, expectations, and physical \ncomplaints.\nObjective: includes information that the practitioner observes \nfrom the patient’s clinical presentation. This may include \nthe medical history review, physical examination, clinical \ninvestigation recommends further investigation, the dentist \nmay be interviewed, and the process will continue according \nto the state’s dental practice act.\nAfter evaluation by the state board and the investigator, if \nthe board determines there has been a violation of the state \ndental practice act, a wide array of sanctions may be imposed \nagainst the dentist. This may include a monetary ine, restric-\ntion of certain practice procedures, continuing education, \nrestitution in the form of repayment to a patient or third-\nparty carrier, or licensure suspension or revocation.\nMost commonly, the highest expenditures involving a \ncomplaint against a licensed dentist are the legal costs associ-\nated with its defense. Most dental professional liability poli-\ncies will not provide for coverage for any state board ines, \nrestitution, continuing education costs, or other discipline \nthat may be imposed.\nLegal Representation. Although many dentists feel that a \nstate board complaint is not as serious as a dental malpractice \nsuit, they are often mistaken. It is highly recommended that \nthe dentist seek legal representation immediately upon being \nnotiied of a state board complaint. Most insurance carriers \nwill provide legal representation for state board issues if they \narise from a dental injury or incident during an active policy \nperiod. An attorney will ensure full compliance with state \nlaws and will aid in the process.\nIf the state investigator requests an interview, an attorney \nis highly recommended to be present. This will prevent the \ndoctor from putting themselves in a compromised or a vul-\nnerable position. More importantly, if the licensing board \nrequests a settlement conference, the practitioner should be \naccompanied by legal representation. This will minimize the \npossibility of the dentist making ill-advised statements that \nmay be detrimental to the inal outcome of their case.\nAVOIDING LAWSUITS\nMAINTAINING ACCURATE, CONCISE  \nDENTAL RECORDS\nThe irst step in an effective overall risk avoidance philosophy \nis to maintain good, accurate, and timely dental records and \ncharting. The dentist with detailed and complete records has \na signiicant advantage in any litigation or administrative \nproceeding.\nProper documentation is important for a number of \nreasons. First, it is a legal requirement of the various state \nlicensing boards. Each practitioner should be familiar with \nthe record-keeping and charting requirements of the jurisdic-\ntion in which they practice. Second, the record is a means of \ncommunication to keep the doctor, as well as other practitio-\nners caring for the patient, apprised of what treatment has \nbeen completed and a summary of future treatment indi-\ncated. Third, charting creates documentation in both litiga-\ntion and administrative proceedings. If charting is inadequate, \nit will create a negative connotation in the eyes of the court \nand jury and may expose the practitioner to discipline."

When confronted with litigation or a licensing \nboard inquiry, the implant clinician may often be inclined to \nmake additions or modiications to the chart. The practitio-\nner will often look back at events or pertinent facts that were \nnot documented and make alterations to place themselves \ninto a more favorable position.\nAltered records are discovered in a number of ways. Often, \nunbeknownst to the dentist, staff has already provided \ncopies of the unaltered chart to the patient. Staff often view \na request for records as an administrative task and unneces-\nsary burden for the doctor. Secondly, the popularity of elec-\ntronic records has raised many validity issues with progress \nnotes and imaging. Most software programs today contain \ntracking and theft mechanisms that will detect if any altera-\ntions were made.\nThere are numerous forensic expert witnesses who are \nspecialists at analyzing questioned documents. These include \ndocument/handwriting examiners, chemists who analyze ink, \nand computer specialists. From a legal perspective, the con-\nsequences of altered records can be catastrophic for the \ndoctor, even where the resulting litigation or administrative \nproceeding is otherwise defensible. The practitioner will lose \ntheir credibility when found guilty of document alteration. \nThe practitioner may also lose their malpractice insurance \ncoverage, as well as the legal representation provided by their \ninsurance malpractice. They may be subject to court sanc-\ntions, including the striking of legal defenses, and/or subject \nthemselves to claims for exemplary or punitive damages, or \neven criminal prosecution.\nIf a change needs to be made to a patient’s record, the \nadded information should be included as an addendum, not \nin the original document. When corrections need to be made, \na single line should be made through any information to be \ndeleted. These changes should be signed and dated \nappropriately.\nCOMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL-DENTAL \nHISTORY FORMS\nA common problem in many dental ofices is the failure of \npractitioners to periodically review and amend their forms \nand record systems. Older, dated medical histories tend to ask \nbroad-based questions (e.g., “Do you suffer from any serious \nmedical condition?” or “Are you in good health?”). This is not \na good practice and often results in signiicant medical issues \nbeing missed. The modern trend in medical histories is \ntowards speciic “condition-based” inquiries.

Implant-related treatment must to be documented in \na comprehensive, detailed manner with respect to the course \nof treatment.

    "content": "855\nCHAPTER 19 Medicolegal Aspects of Implant Dentistry\nFAILURE TO OBTAIN MEDICAL CLEARANCE\nAnother signiicant area of concern that dentists commonly \nfail to address is obtaining medical clearance from the \npatient’s physician. If a practitioner has any doubts concern-\ning a patient’s current medical status or condition, additional \ninquiry is required. The patient’s primary care physician or \ntreating medical physician is in the best position to address \nquestions and issues concerning the patient’s care. In the \nevent of an adverse event, the physician will most likely be \nsupportive. Conversely, should the dentist fail to consult with \nthe physician, they could be the most harmful witness in any \nsubsequent litigation or administrative proceeding.17\nPotential Complications\nNot Providing Physician With Adequate Information. The \ncontent of the medical clearance request is extremely impor-\ntant. Over the years the trend has been to merely request \nclearance to “perform a dental procedure” or to “perform \ndental surgery.” This is completely inadequate because insuf-\nicient information is provided to the physician. The practi-\ntioner’s medical clearance request should at a minimum \ncontain the following18 and should be accompanied by a \ncover letter (Fig. 19.14).\n• A brief description of the procedure(s) to be performed \nincluding time duration and expected estimation of \nblood loss.\n• The patient’s current medical conditions and medication list.\n• A list of pre- and postoperative medications to be admin-\nistered and type of anesthesia (local anesthesia (LA), intra-\nvenous sedation (IV), oral sedation, general anesthesia) to \nbe administered for the procedure.\n• A request for any special instructions the physician may \nhave on the modiication of any current or proposed \nmedications.\n• Most Important: NO MEDICATION SHOULD EVER BE \nALTERED WITHOUT PHYSICIAN’S CLEARANCE.\nOrdering Lab Tests. Because of the increased prevalence of \npatients with systemic diseases, laboratory tests such as hemo-\nglobin A1c (diabetes), CBC (complete blood count) and INR \n(anticoagulant therapy) are often warranted. However, the tests \nshould always be ordered by the physician and interpreted by \nthe physician. If the implant clinician orders a test, they are \nplacing themselves at risk of being responsible for the interpre-\ntation and referral when there are abnormal values.\nNot Following Up With Physician’s Ofice. The implant \nclinician should follow up on a regular basis with the patient’s \nphysician, especially for patients with multiple comorbidities, \nto determine if there is any change in the patient’s health or \nstatus. A patient may have a change in health status or pre-\nscribed medication, which affects treatment planning and/or \nappropriate treatment options.\nVerbal Communication. Care should be taken when obtain-\ning medical clearance via verbal communication. It is highly \nquestions are more easily understood by the patient and are \nless likely to be overlooked.\nA good example are bisphosphonate medications. Most \nolder medical history forms do not ask whether there is a \nhistory of bisphosphonate use because 20 years ago this entire \ndrug category was in its infancy. Today, practitioners regularly \nand routinely encounter patients who have a current or past \nhistory of bisphosphonate use. Where the use of these medi-\ncations is not known, implant clinicians place their patients \nat risk and expose themselves to potential litigation and \nadministrative action. Herbal remedies present similar prob-\nlems. Many supplements affect bleeding, inlammation, and \nhealing and cause drug interaction complications. As such, \nquestions about their use should be an integral part of the \npatient’s medical history form.\nPotential Complications\nNot Updating Forms. If a medical update is not obtained by \nthe doctor, this may show evidence of lack of diligence that \nmay support a patient’s claim of professional negligence. \nPractitioners need to recognize that the practice of dentistry \nis always evolving and that forms require periodic updating. \nIn the event something is missed on the medical history, it is \nnot a valid defense in a legal action that “it was not on the \nform” or that “it’s the software’s fault.” Should a medical com-\nplication occur and litigation result, a patient’s lawyer and \nexpert witness will analyze the patient’s past and current \nmedical history forms with great care. An updated medical \nhistory form should be an essential part of a dentist’s ofice \nrisk management program.\nPrior to each appointment the written medical history \nshould be reviewed along with the patient’s current medica-\ntions and dietary supplements. Patients should be asked if \nthere have been “any changes in the medical history since the \nlast appointment.” At a minimum, a notation should be made \nin the chart conirming that the patient’s health status and \nmedications were reviewed by the practitioner and discussed \nwith the patient, including (when applicable) the lack of any \nchanges in the patient’s health status or medications.\nAt a minimum, patients should have their medical forms \nreviewed or a new medical history questionnaire completed \non an annual basis. A problem arises if an older medical \nhistory is continuously updated: it may be dificult to under-\nstand because it will be crowded with notations and dates. In \nsuch cases a new questionnaire is always recommended.\nLack of Attention to What the Patient States in the Medical \nForms. Practitioners must always review the patient’s medical \nhistory in detail. The doctor should ask questions about posi-\ntive responses and inconsistencies. For example, a patient \nmay list prescription medications on the history form yet fail \nto list a treating or primary care physician. Or a patient may \nindicate that they are a “controlled” diabetic. If the doctor \ndoes not follow up with questions concerning how the \npatient’s diabetes is being treated and their A1c level, the \ndoctor places their patient, and ultimately themselves, at \nunnecessary risk."

If a \nproblem arises and litigation results, testimony most likely \nwill occur many years later. It is often dificult, if not impos-\nsible, for the physician to remember all the details concerning \na phone conversation.\nDentists often are confronted with a physician not \nresponding to a request for medical clearance. This is not a \ngreen light to move forward with treatment. It is entirely \nappropriate to have the patient contact the medical ofice and \ninsist that the physician complete the clearance. It is simply \nnot a valid defense to a civil or administrative proceeding to \nsay that “the physician did not return my calls so I performed \nthe procedure anyway.”\nInadequate Information From Physician. One must make \nsure the clearance is complete prior to undertaking a proce-\ndure. If the medical clearance is equivocal in any respect or \nnot responsive to the practitioner’s speciic concerns, addi-\ntional inquiry is appropriate. If the medical history and/or \nsubsequent clearance reveals a matter potentially affecting the \ncare or treatment, the practitioner should have a detailed \ndiscussion with the patient and the informed consent should \nbe modiied accordingly. In this situation, the patient will be \nwell aware of the potential risks and complications of the \nprocedure, not just from the dentist’s standpoint, but from \nthe physician’s perspective as well.\nCOMPREHENSIVE, DETAILED  \nTREATMENT PLAN\nA detailed treatment plan should be thoroughly discussed \nwith the patient, and the patient should be provided with a \ncopy of the proposed plan in writing. All possible options, \nalong with the advantages and disadvantages of each option, \nshould be discussed in a manner that is easily understood by \nthe patient. Often, practitioners give the patient a single \noption, which, in reality, is simply the option preferred by the \ndoctor. Finally, the treatment plan should include an estimate \nof the cost and anticipated duration of the treatment, as well \nas language addressing the fact that the treatment plan is \n“only an estimate” and “additional procedures and expenses \nmay be necessary” (Fig. 19.15).\nPotential Complications\nUnforeseen Treatment. From time to time, unexpected \nprocedures are necessary in the treatment of dental implant \npatients. This may result in a dispute between the patient and \nthe doctor.\nExample: An example of this situation in oral implantol-\nogy is the extraction of a tooth along with a socket graft. \nCaution should be noted to describe the socket graft as a \n“preliminary graft.” If a tooth is extracted and no buccal plate \nis present, an additional graft may be necessary in the future, \nprior to implant placement. By using the term “preliminary \ngraft,” the practitioner will have informed the patient about \nthe possibility and the need for a second graft.\nDetailed Cost Breakdown. If the practitioner does not give \na detailed fee summary, the patient may not understand the \ntotal extent of treatment. A inancial disagreement may very \nwell lead to the patient pursuing litigation.\nExample: Patients often believe the cost of the implant is \ninclusive of the restoration. The patient must be informed \nand understand that separate fees exist with the implant, \nabutment post, and implant crown.\nGiving Patient One Treatment Option. Furnishing the \npatient with all treatment options minimizes the possibility \nof miscommunication. The patient should be instructed \nto initial the plan selected, and both doctor and patient \nshould sign the form. The document, including the \nplans rejected by the patient, should be made part of the \nchart. In many instances, this may be beneicial for future \ntreatment if the patient decides to upgrade to a different \nprosthesis.\nExample: An edentulous patient is interested in an over-\ndenture; however, after receiving the inal prosthesis, the \npatient is not happy with the movement associated with the \noverdenture. The doctor can then show the patient the other \noptions that were discussed previously with the patient. This \nwill minimize the possibility of the patient becoming upset \nover unreasonable expectations and costs.\nINFORMED CONSENT\nMost practitioners are unaware of the precise language of \ntheir informed consent forms. Ideally, informed consent is an \neducational process that includes the following:\n• An explanation of the problem, condition, or area of \nconcern\n• The consequences of the condition if left untreated\n• The proposed treatment plan\n• The reasonable expectations for the treatment\n• All realistic treatment options, including no treatment\n• The risks and potential beneits of your proposed \ntreatment\nThis information needs to be provided in a form the \npatient can understand, and the patient should be given ade-\nquate time to evaluate and ask questions if necessary.\nThe adequacy of informed consent is in part determined \nby state dental board laws. Each practitioner should be famil-\niar with the obligations imposed by the state board. The \nstandard against which a practitioner’s conduct is measured \nfalls within two broad categories. In the more traditional \napproach the dentist’s conduct will be measured or evaluated \nagainst what a “reasonably prudent practitioner” would have \ntold their patient when presented with the same or similar \nclinical circumstances. A newer and evolving approach \nadopted by a number of states is the “reasonable patient” \nstandard. The dentist’s conduct will be measured against \nwhat a reasonable patient would want to have known prior \nto agreeing to undergo a particular procedure.\nIn summary, the practitioner has a legal obligation to dis-\nclose in an understandable fashion all signiicant and relevant"

In order to prevail on such an informed consent claim, \nthe patient and lawyer must prove a number of legal and \nfactual elements.\nWhen consent was obtained irregularly, these elements \nwill include:\n1. The dentist failed to obtain the consent of the patient at a \ntime and in a manner consistent with acceptable standards \nof care among members of the profession with similar \ntraining and experience in the same or similar medical \ncommunity;\n2. Had the patient been properly informed, the patient would \nnot have consented to the procedure;\n3. As a result, the patient sustained loss, injury, or damages.\nWhen the issue is whether insuficient information was \ngiven, these elements will include:\n1. The dentist failed to provide the patient with suficient \ninformation to give a reasonable person a general under-\nstanding of the proposed treatment or procedure. This \nmay entail failing to provide acceptable alternative treat-\nments or procedures or failing to advise the patient of the \nsubstantial risks and hazards inherent in the proposed \ntreatment or procedure that are recognized by other den-\ntists in the same or a similar community who perform \nsimilar treatments or procedures;\n2. If the patient had been properly informed, the patient \nwould not have reasonably consented to the procedure;\n3. As a result, the patient sustained loss, injury, or damages.\nIt is dificult for a patient to prove they would have refused \ntreatment had they received appropriate consent, and for that \nreason, attorneys ind it dificult to prove claims based on lack \nof informed consent.\nNot Utilizing Informed Refusal. If a patient refuses a recom-\nmended treatment or procedure, the practitioner has a legal \nobligation to advise the patient of the potential adverse con-\nsequences, and to document the patient’s refusal to consent. \nInformed refusal occurs where a patient refuses to accept \nrecommended treatment, therapy, or medication. The dentist \nstill has a duty to provide reasonable and appropriate care \nconsistent with the applicable standards of care. The practi-\ntioner should obtain and clearly document the informed \nrefusal. However, an informed refusal does not constitute \napproval to proceed with treatment when the proposed \ntreatment is against the practitioner’s clinical judgment.\nExample: A patient refuses a cone beam computed tomog-\nraphy (CBCT) scan prior to dental implant surgery. If it is \nagainst the dentist’s clinical judgment to proceed without the \nscan, the practitioner must advise the patient accordingly and \nnot proceed with the surgery, irrespective of the patient’s \n“consent” to the procedure.\nNot Documenting Refusal for Referral. In some situations, \nthe implant clinician may recommend referral to another \ndentist or specialist. If the patient refuses the referral, the \npatient’s decision must be well documented.\nPotential Complications\nBroad Language. The language of the informed consent \nform should be clear and direct, with no room for misinter-\npretation. Language that is too broad will lead to impeach-\nment of the informed consent because of misinterpretation.\nExample: A consent form states that “excessive smoking” \nmay lead to complications resulting in implant failure. In this \nexample, a practitioner would have a very dificult time \nexplaining what “excessive” actually means (i.e., 10, 20, 25 \ncigarettes/day?).\nObtaining Consent Day of Surgery. Consent is best obtained \nprior to the day of surgery. Ideally, the consent should be \navailable on the practice’s website or given to the patient prior \nto the surgical appointment. A good protocol would be to \nhave the patient sign the consent form during a “work-up” \nappointment, which is completed prior to making the surgi-\ncal appointment.\nExample: When a consent form is signed the day of surgery, \npatients often state they “did not read” or “were pressured \ninto signing” the consent document. Additional allegations in \ninformed consent lawsuits include: “I was sedated when the \nform was placed in front of me to sign,” “The front desk \nhanded it to me and said it was nothing,” or “I did not get a \nchance to ask questions.”\nNot Understanding Various Types of Consent\nImplied consent. This form of consent is based on the \nwords or conduct of the patient. Conduct often speaks louder \nthan words. A patient seeks out care and voluntarily submits \nto the proposed treatment.\nExample: A patient who opens his mouth for the admin-\nistration of local anesthetic will not be permitted to deny they \nconsented to local anesthesia. This is by far the weakest form \nof consent and should never be used as the sole type of \nconsent.\nWritten consent form. Formal written consent documents \nhave been the hallmark of dental consent for decades. They \nare often provided from insurance companies or implant \norganizations or they are taken from various textbooks or \ndownloaded off the Internet. The ideal consent form will \nallow the patient to initial each different aspect of the consent \n(Fig. 19.16).\nVerbal consent. Ideally, the practitioner should discuss \nwith the patient all of the risks, beneits, and alternatives to the \nproposed treatment. This verbal consent will act to supplement \nthe written form and should not be used as the sole type of \nconsent. The practitioner should document in the patient’s \nchart that verbal consent was completed as further evidence \nthat informed consent was obtained from the patient.\nVideo consent. The newest and most comprehensive \nform of consent is based on a video review of the procedure \nby the patient. In the event the patient denies all or part of \nwhat was explained in the video presentation, the video may \nbe played for the jury.\nAn area often overlooked by dentists and many seasoned \nlawyers is the concept of informed consent as a cause of"

Such notes should include speciic \ninformation (Box 19.4).\nGOOD RAPPORT WITH PATIENT\nWhen adverse complications arise, doctors should be as \naccommodating as possible to their patient. Studies have \nshown the two main reasons patients take legal action follow-\ning dental surgery are deviations from the standard of care \nand professional attitude.19 If the patient feels betrayed by the \ndoctor or the doctor is less than receptive to the patient’s \nconcerns or complaints, the patient may seek a second \nopinion. That, in turn, may lead to the patient contacting an \nattorney. For these reasons, spending time with the patient \nand discussing the issue and treatment options is far more \nlikely to deter a patient from seeking legal action than ignor-\ning the patient’s concerns or blaming the patient for the com-\nplication. If a patient genuinely feels that their doctor is \ncompassionate and cares about their well-being and is com-\nmitted to achieving a desirable outcome, the threat of litiga-\ntion decreases signiicantly.\nKEEP CURRENT\nAll implant clinicians should stay current with the newest \nresearch and protocols within the profession. An excellent \navenue is continuing education from a course not presented \nby a manufacturer. Practitioners should remain skeptical of \nquestionable new products, as well as manufacturer-based \nstudies. In other words, implant dentists seeking to manage \ntheir risk should adhere to the “don’t be the irst, but don’t \nbe the last,” line of logic.\nUNDERSTAND THE BASICS  \nOF CBCT TECHNOLOGY\nOne of the fastest growing diagnostic areas in implant den-\ntistry is the use of CBCT. However, as CBCT technology \nadvances, so does the potential for litigation. There are several \nfactors that predispose a doctor to liability with CBCT scans.20\nParticularly in the absence of a referral to a specialist, \nexperts working on behalf of the patient will most often focus \non the implant clinician’s failure to: (1) predict the potential \nfor complications; (2) recognize the occurrence of a compli-\ncation and initiate appropriate treatment; or, (3) recognize \nthe occurrence of a complication and make a timely \nreferral.16\nBattery. Theoretically, if treatment is rendered to a patient \nwithout proper informed consent, in certain states this may \nbe construed as “battery” (i.e., intentionally touching a \npatient without obtaining consent). Battery is a criminal \noffense, which can be the basis of a civil lawsuit. The key \nelement of battery is the touching (treatment) is not autho-\nrized by the patient, not that it be intended to harm the \npatient. Forcing beneicial or needed care on an unwilling \npatient would be considered battery. An example of this is the \nperformance of a sinus lift and bone graft on a patient who \nis sedated and has not consented to such procedures.\nMANAGING COMPLICATIONS\nIn the event a complication occurs, at a minimum the prac-\ntitioner should record:\n• What occurred in a detailed, objective manner\n• Detailed plan for addressing the event\n• Discussions with the patient including comprehensive \ninstructions\nThe practitioner’s response to a complication will likely be \na signiicant factor in the outcome of any subsequent litiga-\ntion: it may even determine whether there is any litigation in \nthe irst instance. The dentist should explain to the patient \nthat complications sometimes arise and they will work \nthrough the situation together. Any discussion with the \npatient should be clear and detailed, including the events \nleading to the complication, and documented by the dentist.\nPotential Complications\nPlacing Blame on the Patient. Put simply, it is best to avoid \nblaming the patient for a complication, even in instances \nwhere the patient failed to follow instructions or is otherwise \nresponsible. Ideally, the complication should be addressed \nwith the patient and resolved before the dentist-patient rela-\ntionship is compromised by ill will or severed completely.\nExample: Many dentists will blame a failed implant (early \nfailure) on the patient’s lack of hygiene.\nNot Documenting After Hours Phone Calls. One of the \nmost important aspects of the treatment of complications is \nthe documentation of “night of surgery” or “after hours” \ncommunications. These communications are particularly \nimportant in instances where the complication results in liti-\ngation or administrative proceedings. For this reason, practi-\ntioners should maintain an “After Hours Contact Form” or \nalternative method of documenting “after hours” communi-\ncations with patients. This includes “night of surgery” post-\noperative checks, patient calls regarding complications, and/\nBOX 19.4 After Hours Contact Form\n• Date and time of the call\n• Who initiated the call\n• Who was spoken to: the patient, family member or other \nindividual\n• Any subjective complaints of the patient\n• Inquiry as to whether the patient had prescriptions illed \nand if they are taking the medications as directed.\n• Instructions given, if any\n• Prescriptions called in with the name and phone number \nof the pharmacy\n• Any offers to see the patient apart from the scheduled \nfollow up\n• Any additional information"

In general, a patient cannot consent to the negligence \nof their dentist or other health care provider.25 Waivers of \nliability typically have no legal effect and are inadmissible.\nGUARANTEED OUTCOME OF TREATMENT\nCaution should be exercised to avoid guaranteeing the results \nof treatment such as the ability to masticate certain types of \nfood (e.g., eat an apple). Marketing advertisements may also \nindirectly be interpreted by patients as guaranteed results. \nThese issues may be minimized by good verbal communica-\ntion prior to treatment on the possible complications and \nassociated longevity of the prosthesis. Usually, dissatisfaction \nwith esthetics can be explained by unreasonable expectations \nby the patient. However, if the doctor has marketing materials \nsuch as before and after photos of previous cases, this may be \nconstrued by the patient as the expected outcome.\nExample: This will most likely occur with maxillary ante-\nrior implant in which the inal crown will be elongated or \nlonger than the adjacent teeth. Ideally, this possibility should \nbe included in the consent form prior to treatment.\nPATIENT ABANDONMENT\nIn the medical ield a doctor has an obligation to treat the \npatient once the dentist-patient relationship has been estab-\nlished. However, there may be instances where it is unreason-\nable or impossible to fulill the demands of the patient to \ncomplete treatment. Sometimes a patient will become unrea-\nsonably demanding or refuse to accept proposed treatment \nrecommendations. It is prudent to send a letter to the patient \nindicating that the dentist-patient relationship is being ter-\nminated and clearly outline the treatment needs of the \npatient, including follow-up care. To guard against being \naccused of abandonment, the dentist should take the follow-\ning steps:\n1. Document completely the noncompliant actions of the \npatient\n2. Send a termination letter (certiied) to the patient with \nthe following information:\n• The reason for dismissal from the practice\n• The consequences of not seeking treatment by \nanother practitioner\n• An offer to see patient on an emergency basis for a \nreasonable period of time (≈30 days)\n• Recommendation on possible avenues for the patient \nto obtain another dentist (e.g., local dental society)\n• Offer to forward progress notes and radiographic \ninformation to the new practitioner upon receipt of \na release (Fig. 19.17).\nSUMMARY\nMalpractice suits are a feared, often devastating and infuriating, \nevent that changes a doctor’s life. Especially in the ield of oral \nPotential Liability\nTo Take a Scan or Not. In medicine, radiographic equip-\nment is usually not approved for a particular purpose or \nindication. Nor is there any actual “standard of care” or uni-\nversally accepted guidelines for the use of CBCT technologies. \nInstead, any applicable standard of care is mandated by the \nlegislature, a court, or dental board.20\nOn the other hand, even in the absence of an express \nguideline, an implant clinician is more likely to be questioned \nfor failing to use available CBCT technologies preoperatively \nif a complication arises.21\nTechnical Parameters. The doctor ordering the scan must \nbe careful to select the correct parameters of the scan. Inade-\nquate or improper CBCT settings and parameters may lead to \nliability. Examples include ordering a scan with low resolution \nwhen a high resolution is indicated (e.g., tooth fracture).\nField of View. The ield of view (FOV, anatomic limits of \nthe scan) is crucial in the preoperative assessment of an \nimplant patient. Ideally, the FOV should be the smallest pos-\nsible to reduce the patient x-ray dosage and improve spatial \nresolution. However, if the FOV is too small, inadequate suf-\nicient evaluation of the anatomic area will result. This is \nmost commonly seen in the posterior maxillary augmenta-\ntion when too small a ield of view is used. If there is any type \nof pathology in the sinus and the scan is not taken high \nenough to determine the patency of the ostium, the doctor is \nat risk of causing serious sinus issues because of the inability \nto determine the patency of the ostium and the nature of the \npathology.\nInterpreting the Scan. There is no current consensus on the \nlegal ramiications of interpreting CBCT scans. However, as \na general proposition the implant dentist remains responsible \nfor interpreting the entire scan.22 The implant clinician has \nthree options. The implant clinician may: (1) interpret the \nscan themselves; (2) send the CBCT data to a licensed radi-\nologist, or (3) have the CBCT data evaluated by the hospital \nor imaging center radiologist.\nReferral to Radiologist. Ideally, most clinicians will decrease \ntheir liability by referring their CBCT scans to a radiologist \nfor evaluation. However, if the doctor sends the scan to a \nradiologist who is unqualiied to interpret the scan, the \ndentist may have liability for the negligent referral.23 Addi-\ntionally, the CBCT scan must be read by a radiologist licensed \nin the same state as the implant clinician. Otherwise, the \ndentist may be subject to disciplinary action by the state \ndental board for aiding and abetting the radiologist’s unli-\ncensed practice of medicine and for negligent referral of the \npatient’s scan to the unlicensed provider.24 The implant clini-\ncian also should conirm that the radiologist’s malpractice \ninsurance covers the reading of CBCT scans.\nWaiver of Liability. Many implant clinicians who are \nuntrained in CBCT interpretation request their patients sign"
