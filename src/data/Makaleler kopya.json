    "Main Outcome (Ana Bulgular)": "In meta-analysis, bone-supported guides showed significantly greater deviations than tooth-supported guides in implant angle, entry point, and apex position (p≤0.01) . Mucosa-supported guides also had significantly more accurate results (smaller deviations) than bone-supported (p=0.02 for angle, 0.002 entry, 0.04 apex) . There was no significant accuracy difference between mucosa- vs tooth-supported guide outcomes . Thus, guides anchored on teeth or mucosa yield higher implant placement precision than those on bone.",
    "Conclusion (Sonuç/Öneri)": "The supporting tissue type for a static guide substantially influences placement accuracy . Bone-supported guides (often used in fully edentulous cases with open flaps) are the least accurate, likely due to reduced stability and fit issues when a flap is reflected. Tooth-supported and mucosa-supported guides provide more stable reference and therefore more precise implant positioning . Clinicians should be aware that fully edentulous cases with bone-supported guides have higher error risk and should take extra precautions (bone reduction for guide seating, verification of guide fit, etc.) to improve accuracy.",

However, it showed no significant effect on other post-op complications (p=0.96) . The calculated NNT was high (>5), indicating many patients would need antibiotics to prevent one infection . Adverse effects were rare and not statistically different (p=0.63, NNH ~528) .",

    "Intervention / Comparison (Uygulama/Karşılaştırma)": "Biologic impact of surgical steps in implant osteotomy (flap elevation, drilling, bone condensation, implant insertion) on bone healing and complications",
    "Main Outcome (Ana Bulgular)": "Flap elevation: Raising a full-thickness flap disrupts periosteal blood supply, causing immediate bone remodeling – e.g., 9% medullary bone volume loss was observed in flapped vs non-flapped sites in dogs . Thermal injury: Drilling without proper irrigation can exceed the 47 °C threshold for bone necrosis; guided systems with sleeves may reduce irrigation efficacy (heat risk) . Insertion torque and micromotion: Overcompression of bone (e.g., using osteotomes or undersized osteotomy) can cause microfractures and delay healing, while excessive micromotion can jeopardize osseointegration. Titanium particles: Implant insertion and concurrent bone tapping generate Ti wear particles; these have been implicated in inflammatory reactions resembling peri-implantitis when corroded . Platform design: Platform switching and conical implant–abutment connections reduce crestal bone stress, helping limit remodeling, though bone loss still occurs from combined factors (surgical trauma + biology) .",
    "Conclusion (Sonuç/Öneri)": "Successful implant site preparation requires minimizing trauma and respecting bone biology . Key recommendations: perform flapless or mini-flap surgery when possible (to preserve periosteum and blood supply) ; use sharp drills with copious irrigation (including internal irrigation or pre-cooled saline) to prevent overheating ; avoid over‐torquing implants – achieving primary stability is important, but not at the expense of crushing bone. Additionally, thorough irrigation during implant insertion can help wash out titanium debris. Implant design features (platform switch, surface treatments) aid in bone maintenance but cannot compensate for surgical trauma . In summary, gentle surgical technique and biologically oriented planning (ensuring sufficient bone volume, doing GBR if needed) are essential to prevent complications like marginal bone loss or early implant failure.",

    "Main Outcome (Ana Bulgular)": "Misplacement of implants in the esthetic zone (outside the ideal 3D “comfort zone”) commonly leads to adverse outcomes: loss of papillary height, gingival recessions, and compromised prosthetics . If an implant is too close to a tooth or another implant, proximal bone loss and papilla flattening occur ; too buccal placement leads to thin/absent facial bone and mucosal recession. Minor positioning errors might be mitigated by soft-tissue grafting or custom prosthetics, but major errors often cannot be fully corrected without removing and re-positioning the implant .",
    "Conclusion (Sonuç/Öneri)": "Virtually all implant positioning complications in the anterior maxilla stem from preventable clinician errors in diagnosis or execution . With modern diagnostics (CBCT) and guided surgery, such malpositions should be avoidable. The authors emphasize that if an implant is placed in a “danger zone” and causes significant aesthetic issues, the only reliable solution may be explantation and reimplantation in the correct position . Therefore, prevention (accurate planning, use of surgical guides, and proper training) is far preferable, as corrective treatments for malpositions are unpredictable and limited in their success.",

    "Main Outcome (Ana Bulgular)": "Soft-tissue dehiscence with graft exposure is the most common complication in ridge augmentation, leading to contamination or loss of the bone graft/membrane . The authors classify complications by extent of exposure and infection: Class 1: minor exposure (≤5 mm) without infection; Class 2: large exposure (>5 mm) without infection; Class 3: infection without any exposure (e.g., abscess under closed flap); Class 4: small exposure with infection (≤5 mm with suppuration); Class 5: large exposure with infection (>5 mm with suppuration) . Neural injuries (e.g., IAN paresthesia) are classified separately (Class 0) . Class 1 or 2 exposures often result in only partial regeneration, while Classes 4–5 typically lead to graft failure .",
    "Conclusion (Sonuç/Öneri)": "Management depends on the class: For Class 1–2 (exposure without infection), the approach is usually conservative – maintain graft stability, apply chlorhexidine, possibly add a collagen membrane or re-suture to cover the small dehiscence, and observe . Class 3 (infection without exposure) requires systemic antibiotics and possibly incision/drainage; the graft can sometimes be preserved if infection resolves . Class 4 (small exposure + infection) and Class 5 (large exposure + infection) often necessitate graft removal (especially Class 5) and thorough debridement, plus antibiotics . Prevention is paramount: tension-free primary closure, sufficient periosteal releasing incisions, and patient factors (smoking cessation, etc.) must be addressed to avoid dehiscences . Neural complications (Class 0) should be prevented by preoperative 3D planning; minor nerve injuries are monitored, whereas persistent deficits may require microneurosurgical consult .",

    "Main Outcome (Ana Bulgular)": "Guided surgery enabled precise implant positioning and immediate loading, but an early complication occurred: within 2 weeks post-op, lack of integration in one implant (due to insufficient primary stability) led to removal of the interim prosthesis . The final restoration was delayed until the issue was resolved. The case highlights that protocol deviations (e.g., inadequate vertical dimension adjustment, overestimation of achievable stability) can cause guided surgery failures despite accurate drilling.",
    "Conclusion (Sonuç/Öneri)": "Lessons: Computer-guided implant surgery is a valuable tool for accuracy and reduced invasiveness, yet it is not foolproof . Strict protocol adherence is essential: in this case, delivering immediate full-arch load without verifying each implant’s stability contributed to failure. The authors emphasize the need for thorough pre-surgical planning (including making new dentures to correct VDO), verification of implant stability before immediate loading, and surgeon training on the guided system . With these precautions, guided implantology can significantly improve outcomes, but without them, it may lead to complications that negate its benefits.",

Proper patient evaluation (e.g., risk of peri-implantitis, systemic factors), material selection, and adherence to prosthetically driven planning are key preventive measures .",
    "Conclusion (Sonuç/Öneri)": "The clinician’s judgment and planning are the critical determinants of implant success or complications . To prevent complications, clinicians must: (1) thoroughly assess patient/systemic risk factors, (2) use prosthetic-driven planning to place implants in “comfort zones,” (3) ensure proper surgical technique (atraumatic extractions, tension-free flaps, primary stability), and (4) maintain implants with regular monitoring .

    "Main Outcome (Ana Bulgular)": "No conclusive evidence (as of 2016) that computer-guided implantation yields superior clinical outcomes (safety, success, efficiency) over conventional freehand surgery . High inaccuracy rates have been reported, especially with bone-supported guides, due to cumulative errors from imaging, guide fabrication, and surgical execution . Advances like real-time navigation and improved data merging (digital impressions + CBCT) are expected to enhance accuracy in the future .",
    "Conclusion (Sonuç/Öneri)": "Computer-guided implant surgery offers enhanced planning capabilities but does not automatically improve outcomes compared to skilled freehand surgery . Its efficacy is limited by guide-related inaccuracies; therefore, fundamental principles (adequate surgical training, proper case selection, safety margins) remain essential . Long-term RCTs are needed to determine if guidance truly reduces complications or if human factors dominate. Until then, guided surgery should be used as an adjunct tool rather than a guaranteed way to prevent errors.",

    "Main Outcome (Ana Bulgular)": "Reported implant survival rates in autoimmune disease (AD) patients were generally high (85%–100% over mid-term follow-up) , comparable to healthy populations. However, about half of implant failures in AD patients occurred early (before or shortly after loading), indicating a propensity for early osseointegration issues in some immunocompromised conditions . Notably, patients with active mucosal autoimmune conditions (untreated oral lichen planus, pemphigus, etc.) experienced elevated failure rates – one study lost 42 of 55 implants during an OLP flare . Most AD patients were on immunosuppressants (steroids, DMARDs), but no clear pattern emerged linking specific medications to implant failure (other than high-dose corticosteroids possibly delaying healing in a few reports).",
    "Conclusion (Sonuç/Öneri)": "Despite immune dysregulation, patients with autoimmune diseases can be successfully treated with dental implants, achieving survival rates close to those of healthy patients, provided the autoimmune condition is well-controlled . The main caution is a slightly higher risk of early implant loss, especially in active disease phases. The review suggests ensuring any mucosal lesions (e.g., OLP) are in remission before implant placement, and closely monitoring initial healing in AD patients . Overall, current evidence (albeit low-level) does not contraindicate implant therapy in AD patients, but emphasizes individualized planning and possibly staging (waiting longer before loading) to mitigate risks.",

    "Intervention / Comparison (Uygulama/Karşılaştırma)": "Guided (sleeve) drilling vs non-guided drilling – comparison of heat generated in bone during osteotomy",
    "Main Outcome (Ana Bulgular)": "All studies found that guided drilling generates more heat at the osteotomy site than freehand drilling (due to guide sleeves restricting irrigation and causing friction) . However, the temperature increase with guided surgery generally remained below the critical 47 °C threshold for bone necrosis in the conditions tested . Other factors like external irrigation, drill design, and speed had a significant influence: for example, using room-temperature irrigation vs chilled made a difference of several °C, and longer drills produced more heat due to prolonged contact . There was insufficient uniform data for a meta-analysis, but qualitatively all results agreed on these trends.",
    "Conclusion (Sonuç/Öneri)": "Guided implant osteotomy does produce higher bone temperatures than freehand drilling, but typically not high enough to cause thermal bone injury if standard irrigation is used . Clinicians using surgical guides should be mindful of potential reduced cooling – e.g., by ensuring ample irrigation and possibly intermittent drilling to dissipate heat . The review concludes that while guided surgery’s slight increase in heat is a theoretical concern, in practice it can be safely managed by controlling known factors (adequate coolant flow, slower drill speeds, sharp drills). No cases of heat-induced osteonecrosis were found in the literature reviewed.",

    "Intervention / Comparison (Uygulama/Karşılaştırma)": "Techniques for failed implant removal and subsequent site management (timing of re-implantation, regeneration needs)",
    "Main Outcome (Ana Bulgular)": "The preferred removal technique is minimally invasive (e.g., using a trephine or an implant removal device that applies reverse torque) to preserve bone . This often allows immediate implant replacement if sufficient bone remains and infection is controlled. If implants fail due to peri-implantitis, significant bone defects may be present – roughly 46–50% of implant losses occur prior to or at loading in compromised patients . Site after removal: Usually shows a bony defect; infected sites have less vascular granulation tissue, which can impair healing . Cortical bone perforations or decortication (corticotomies) can be done to stimulate bleeding and healing if re-implanting later . Decision on immediate vs delayed re-implantation depends on primary stability and absence of infection – if infection or poor stability, a delayed approach with bone grafting is recommended.",
    "Conclusion (Sonuç/Öneri)": "Implant removal is now a common practice and should aim to minimize patient morbidity . When removing an implant, techniques that preserve bone (e.g., adapter kits that unscrew the implant) are favored over aggressive trephining . After removal, the clinician must decide on timing for re-implantation: if the site is healthy and primary stability is achievable, a new implant can sometimes be placed immediately. However, in cases of peri-implant infection or large defects, it’s advisable to graft/regenerate the site and allow healing before re-placing an implant . Patients should be informed that implant removal can lead to bone loss, and additional procedures (GBR, sinus lift, etc.) might be required to facilitate a new implant. Overall, successful outcomes rely on ensuring the infection is fully resolved and adequate bone volume is restored prior to re-implantation.",

    "Study Type": "Systematic Review & Meta-Analysis (RCTs)",

    "Intervention / Comparison (Uygulama/Karşılaştırma)": "Flapless static computer-guided implant placement vs traditional flapped placement (with or without partial guidance)",
    "Main Outcome (Ana Bulgular)": "Short-term outcomes: Flapless fully-guided surgery significantly reduced surgery time and patient morbidity (less pain/swelling) compared to open-flap surgery . It maintained equal or better implant placement accuracy versus freehand (guided flapless showed accuracy on par with guided with flap) . 1-year outcomes: Similar implant survival and peri-implant health between flapless guided and flapped approaches (no adverse effect of flapless approach noted).",
    "Conclusion (Sonuç/Öneri)": "Flapless, fully-guided implant surgery provides the benefits of minimally invasive technique (shorter, less traumatic surgery) without compromising accuracy or efficacy . It is recommended in suitable cases (adequate keratinized tissue, no need for simultaneous bone graft) to improve patient comfort. However, surgeons must account for a learning curve and still observe safety margins (~2–3 mm), as even guided implants have some placement deviation . Overall, fully-guided flapless placement can be considered a predictable option when properly executed.",

    "Main Outcome (Ana Bulgular)": "Even with digital planning, guided implant surgery is not free of error – deviations between planned and actual implant positions occur due to compound errors at each step . Major contributors to inaccuracy include: imaging errors or distortion, misalignment in guide fabrication or placement (e.g., guide not fully seated), movement or flex of the guide (especially if inadequate fixation pins), and sleeve inner diameter allowing drill “play” . Additionally, guided systems may impede irrigation (metal sleeves can limit coolant flow to the osteotomy), potentially raising bone temperature . Dynamic navigation allows real-time adjustment but requires expensive equipment and is technique-sensitive .",
    "Conclusion (Sonuç/Öneri)": "To optimize guided surgery outcomes, the surgeon must strictly adhere to protocols and account for known error sources . This includes verifying guide fit (and using fixation pins for full stability), respecting a safety buffer (~2 mm) around vital structures despite guided accuracy, ensuring proper irrigation to avoid thermal damage, and having adequate training in the guided system . With increasing experience and improved technology, guided surgery can become more predictable, but the clinician’s expertise remains the most important factor in avoiding complications .",
